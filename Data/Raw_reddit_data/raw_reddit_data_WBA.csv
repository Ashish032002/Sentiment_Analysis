WBA - has it bottomed?,7,1elmzf0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1elmzf0/wba_has_it_bottomed/,37,2024-08-06 22:27:45,"In the blood bath that engulfed the market on Monday, like many of you I was looking for opportunities.  I stumbled upon Walgreens, which was the biggest loser in the S&P, down over 6%.

Further research showed that the company is currently trading at a 10-year low, and in fact, at levels not seen since 1997. Some of the numbers are staggering, screaming ""how could you not buy this?"":

* Price to book: under .7
* Price to sales: under .1
* Dividend: 9.32%
* Market cap vs. Revenue: 9.2 billion vs 145 billion

Seeing those numbers, I was shocked.  I mean, a company that generates 145 billion in revenue has a market cap of under 10 billion?!?!

I read a number of articles / Morningstar on the decline in Walgreens, to try and understand this baffling situation. Many of them cite similar issues:

* Stores locking up their goods to prevent theft, which also prevents sales / appeal of shopping
* High prices leading customers to shop elsewhere
* Convenience of Amazon vs. going to a Walgreens
* Pharmacy benefit managers lowering reimbursement costs

As a result, many people want to call Walgreens the next Blockbuster or Sears.  I.e. The next big American co. to fail and go bankrupt. 

However I struggle to see that outcome at this juncture.  Unlike the two mentioned above, Walgreens is still growing revenue.  Admittedly, earnings is not growing, but that problem seems relatively straightforward to fix - and they have already announced the fix.  75% of stores generate 100% of the operating income.  Close the 25% of stores that are unprofitable, and you have a path back to significant profitability. 

  
While Amazon is a disruptor to retail sales (like Netflix was to Blockbuster perhaps), Amazon is NOT a disruptor to pharmacy.  Who in their right mind is ordering any drugs off Amazon?  Logical people go to a pharmacy - and on the way out, they may buy some convenience items.  That is not changing. 

Their venture into healthcare also creates a new potential revenue stream at the stores that remain.  The synergies between pharmacy and healthcare are obvious.  Walmart passed on this business opp, because its not a pharmacy.  I would definitely head to a Walgreens for vaccines over Walmart, because of the company's background in pharmacy

Overall - I think rumors of WBA's demise have been greatly exaggerated. The market cap of the co. should return to 20 - 30 billion once the company executes its strategy to close unprofitable locations

I leave you again with the numbers, they are insane:

I am opening a four-month position in Walgreens Boots Alliance with a mix of Call Options and Shares. I'm no big boy investor so this is a smaller position, but I'm trying to add as much as I can before a boom in the near future. 

Now, why am I betting on a limp dick stock like $WBA? Firstly the bear case. $WBA has been trading lower than the rest of the market for a while now. Its revenue declined massively during 2020 largely due to COVID and that is reflected in its earnings call for August 2020.

 However, let's look closer at this sell-off. Personally, I think it's way more overblown than it deserves. The initial peak was due to vaccinations increasing and the sell-off was due to Anti-Vaxxers decreasing these vaccine rates. Bastards aren't just ruining normal life but my fucking money go figure. That said this sell-off was violent and fast which I believe reached a resting spot on the chart that has been increasing since SPY's big boom. Besides even if the stock relies on vaccinations, the increasing delta variant and the threat of lockdowns will surely boost those needle numbers.

Also look at their most recent earnings call, stellar numbers with massive increases across the board. Pay a lot of attention to the Net Income but every single metric is increasing by massive amounts that don't justify a sell-off. If anything it should be back to its recent high and approaching its 2018 levels.

Walgreens,13,1dpz15h,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1dpz15h/walgreens/,19,2024-06-28 00:25:03,"Hey everyone,

I'm thinking about buying Walgreens (WBA) stock, but I'm not sure if it's a good move right now. Walgreens dropped by about 25% in a single day recently, and I'm curious about the reasons behind it and if it might be undervalued now.

Here's what I've found so far:
- The drop happened after Walgreens reported a 25% year-over-year decline in adjusted earnings for Q3 2024. This was due to weaker consumer demand and some impairment charges from recent acquisitions
- some analysts think Walgreens is undervalued, estimating its fair value at around $24 per share, which is about 50% higher than its current price
- Walgreens has a high dividend yield of around 8.38%, which is great for dividend lovers like me. But they did cut their quarterly dividend from $0.48 to $0.25 per share recently 
- They're trying to stabilize revenue through cost-cutting and acquisitions, like Summit Health and Village MD, which seem promising
- There are also broader economic concerns like high oil prices and interest rates that could impact their performance 

So, given all this, do you think Walgreens is a good buy for a long-term, dividend-focused investor? Would love to hear your thoughts and any additional insights! Thanks!"

Why Wallgreens ($WBA) is THE rebound play for July and August,164,oi3wzy,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oi3wzy/why_wallgreens_wba_is_the_rebound_play_for_july/,160,2021-07-11 18:22:36,"Wallgreen Boots reported earnings on July the 1st that literally crushed estimates. WBA generated $34.03 billion in revenue (+12.1% y/y), beating estimates by $560 million and that flowed through to the bottom line, with GAAP EPS of $1.27, beating estimates by $0.36 per share.

Management increased its FY2021 guidance from mid-to-high single digit growth to around 10% growth and said that WBA is on track to deliver in excess of $2 billion in annual cost savings by FY2022. Despite these positives, WBA sold off quite a bit after the report was announced.

&#x200B;

[https://preview.redd.it/ab7t3hhryka71.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=15503398361403ad7aec294bc0daac737138ff6f](https://preview.redd.it/ab7t3hhryka71.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=15503398361403ad7aec294bc0daac737138ff6f)

It appears that analysts were pricing in an even higher guidance increase than WBA had announced and lowered their ratings as a result.

Analysts are predicting that the end of the vaccination drive will result in less traffic and sales. Surely WBA had some benefit in terms of sales from drawing in potential customers as it administered more than 25 million vaccines, but even without that traffic, I'm still bullish on WBA's long-term prospects.

&#x200B;

But why I'm bullish on the stock short term? T**he answers is that the sell off was unwarranted and the technicals have been looking quite well.**

WBA had 6 red days since earnings were announced. The RSI went down to 18 being extremely oversold. Friday the stock bounced and now there is a **bullish RSI divergence on the hourly chart** on significant volume (7m vs 5m daily average volume). **The stock bounced off the 200DMA**.

Why calls are looking good? **Because IV is quite low with an average of 27%** for July the 30th expiry.

Apart from the above and the technicals, their stake at VillageMD and their plans for same day prescription delivery, along with the potential of a third covid booster needed all point to a (market allowing) **bullish reversal and a return to the 52$ area.**

**TL:DR**

**WBA calls for July and August are looking good, share price likely to rebound**

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

Walgreens ($WBA) is a safe and cheap stock, selling at a discount, with an improving underlying business, and ripe for a buyout. In addition to a healthy 4% dividend, Walgreens is also a major potential takeover target in the healthcare/pharmaceutical space. Selling at attractive valuations, and as both a Dow component and a best-of-breed player in the pharmacy business, we think Walgreens represents a huge investment opportunity. Furthermore, with cheap valuations, a low Beta, and lower correlation to the broader market, we believe WBA is a top defensive play & income producer, and could be added as a core position to anyone’s portfolio. Including WBA in your portfolio is highly likely to reduce overall portfolio volatility and risk, and improve your performance.

**Our price target for $WBA is $74, an upside of approximately 50%.**

Below are the 6 main reasons we’re bullish on WBA.

&#x200B;

**1)** **WBA is a Dow component.**

Walgreens stock ($WBA) is a Dow component. As one of only 30 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (the oldest and most historically-followed U.S. market index dating back to the late 1800s), WBA is now considered one of the select large-cap companies which (together) accurately represent the overall market.

Though WBA has a small weighting in the Dow (only \~1% when compared to 3% for Apple (AAPL), 5% for Microsoft (MSFT), and 7% for Goldman Sachs (GS), for example), it still stands to benefit greatly from being one of the most visible and widely-followed stocks as part of the Dow index. Moreover, with $Billions (or Trillions) of Dollars in passive investing, a lot of money flows to index funds. As index funds are bought, money is then invested into WBA, which pushes the price up.

WBA has A LOT of room to go. Its stock price can increase and earn a higher weighting, which could then trigger a “virtuous cycle”, where the stock price increases --> WBA weighting increases --> more passive (and active) money flows into WBA --> the stock price increases --> the positive cycle repeats.

In short, as a (relatively new) part of the Dow, WBA stock stands to gain. As it benefits from passive/index investing, its market cap can be $Billions larger. The honor of being one of the few companies in the Dow will keep WBA stock visible to investors and will keep the stock supported in a big way.

&#x200B;

**2)** **Best-of-Breed in Pharmacy/Healthcare**

Walgreens is clearly one o f the largest players and best-of-breed companies in the Pharmacy/Healthcare space. Not only is WBA’s inclusion in the Dow a huge statement that WBA is best-of-breed, but also the lack of competition and alternative choices in pharmacy stocks is a huge advantage to WBA. With only CVS ($CVS) and Rite-aid ($RAD) as similar peers in the entire market (and with worse financials!), WBA is a clear #1 investment choice.

&#x200B;

**3)** **4% Dividend**

A 4% dividend makes WBA an income investment opportunity, in addition to the growth and stock price increases we expect to see in the near future. Not only is WBA a relatively safe stock with a low Beta (lower volatility than the broader market), but also the excellent 4% dividend payment is already half of the stock market’s yearly average return (8%) going back 100+ years.

Its further possible that WBA’s dividend can continue to grow sustainably; in fact, WBA is a blue-chip dividend powerhouse and officially a member of the ""Dividend Aristocrats"", companies which have increased their dividend for 25+ consecutive years. Walgreens has increased its dividend for 45 years and running.

&#x200B;

**4)** **Attractive Valuations**

WBA has very attractive valuations, and the stock is selling at a major discount. Investors have a chance right now to buy the stock and a great company at a bargain, right before the stock price could rise by 50%+.

Why is the stock so cheap? The company has shown poor stock performance over the past few years mostly due to poor earnings performance, low profitability, and high debt. Fortunately, things are improving and the stock hasn’t yet reflected the good news. It will soon be priced in, and the stock price will rise.

How do we know it’s cheap? Why is the stock a “buy”? WBA stock sells at attractive low multiples (1) on an absolute basis (10x forward P/E, 2x P/B, 9x P/FCF), (2) on an historical basis (lowest P/S and near 15-year low P/B and P/FCF), and (3) on a peer comparables basis (WBA is selling at significantly cheaper valuation multiples than Walmart (WMT), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Procter & Gamble (PG), Target (TGT), Dollar General (DG), United Health (UNH), Cigna (CI), etc.).

In other words, the stock is cheap on nearly all fronts, and potentially offering a major value investment. If WBA had multiples more comparable to its peer group, the stock would be trading at a significantly higher price. As market participants come to realize this market mispricing/inefficiency, the stock price is likely to adjust higher.

&#x200B;

**5)** **Improving Business**

Walgreens’ business and future prospects seem to be improving. With a new CEO at the helm (the first African American female CEO of a Fortune 500 company), along with critical strategic decisions/initiatives likely upcoming, WBA is very well-positioned to grow and gain market share.

With most locations (physical stores) in very good condition still looking new, located on prime real estate, and acting as top places to get vaccinated against Covid-19, there is plenty more time in WBA’s bullish cycle. 

We will look at the upcoming year’s revenue, income, and cash flows to judge WBA’s progress and performance.

&#x200B;

**6)** **Takeover Target / Buyout**

The cherry on top for Walgreens ($WBA) stock is a takeover.

Walgreens is an attractive takeover target. Especially in the retail/pharmaceutical/healthcare space, Walgreens presents a market-moving opportunity for a large public company or private equity group. In fact, this was attempted not too long ago when in late-2019 KKR ($KKR) showed interest in taking WBA private in the largest private-equity buyout of all-time (see: [https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/11/walgreens-boots-alliance-kkr-buyout-offer](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/11/walgreens-boots-alliance-kkr-buyout-offer) ). The takeover offer at the time was $70-80/share, 40-60% higher than current prices.

There is clearly significant interest in WBA, and it’s been quiet for a little while. The sleeping lion (or bull?) could wake up at any moment.

A takeover has been attempted at much higher prices by private equity buyers. The existence of such investor interest and possible takeover offers provides (1) a strong catalyst for a soaring stock price, and (2) a floor to the stock, which will support the stock at or above current prices. If the stock price drops too far, buyers are highly likely to step in.

Additionally, though maybe unlikely, both Amazon ($AMZN) and Warren Buffett / Berkshire Hathaway ($BRK/A)($BRK/B) could be potential buyers. Amazon has shown much interest in expanding into Pharma/Drugs/Prescriptions as well as expanding its retail operation. WBA seems to be a great potential fit; and at only $50-100B, WBA is not such a big purchase for the $2 Trillion market cap Amazon.

Warren Buffett and/or Berkshire Hathaway could also be a potential investor. WBA fits many of the criteria which Buffett and other value investors look for. Additionally, Buffett and a joint venture between Amazon, Berkshire, and JP Morgan (called “Haven”) showed strong interest in disrupting the healthcare sector until recently disbanding (see: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/04/haven-the-amazon-berkshire-jpmorgan-venture-to-disrupt-healthcare-is-disbanding-after-3-years.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/04/haven-the-amazon-berkshire-jpmorgan-venture-to-disrupt-healthcare-is-disbanding-after-3-years.html) ).

It seems painfully clear that Amazon ($AMZN), Berkshire ($BRK/A)($BRK/B), and other major players are highly-interested in gaining a foothold in the space which Walgreens ($WBA) already dominates. If takeover interest materializes, or if Buffett decides to invest more heavily in WBA, you can bet there will be a lot of attention on the stock, and the stock price is likely to be much higher."

I'll keep this short... We all know that $PFE shit the bed in our portfolios on vaccine news & that's fine because I have a new play for us. $WBA. Now I know what you're thinking, total boomer stock I know i know... But with low IV & great news this could be a real bag! 3 million vaccines already ready to be delivered by $WBA. 

NEWS THIS AM: Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. (WBA) said Friday it has begun administering Pfizer Inc.'s (PFE) and BioNTech SE's (BNTX) COVID-19 vaccine to residents and staff at long-term care facilities, starting with Connecticut and Ohio. Starting Dec. 21, the drug store chain and health care services company said its pharmacy team members will provide vaccinations at about 800 long-term care facilities across 12 states... continue DD below....

Quick TA : Chart forming Cup & handle and ready to breakout - Coming off of roughly a 7 day consolidation period after testing 6 month highs... Cleared resistance around $40.88 this morning  & should now build new support & rip higher. Every bit of news (Which will be tons) will continue to rip this stock up. GET IN WHILE IV IS LOW!!

[From Tradeview: Great EW count by ZunamiWave](https://preview.redd.it/cqb7iuek8y561.png?width=2172&format=png&auto=webp&s=10a945116819eb577b648f88188fb246d0d18b6c)

&#x200B;

Get on before the rocket leaves the station, this boomer stock will GO!!

For real though, picking stock's with super high IV and all the hype, will slowly bleed your portfolio if you lose even the slightest momentum. Grab something BEFORE the FOMO kicks in... 

**TLDR or whatever**: Buy shares/contracts $WBA - Starting out with distributing vaccines to over 3 million people at over 35,000 long term care facilities! Only UP FROM HERE!!!

BBBY: Undervalued and Overshorted,573,pf626r,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pf626r/bbby_undervalued_and_overshorted/,140,2021-08-31 19:09:21,"Alright degenerates, you know Bed Bath and Beyond? That store you always go to to buy things for your wife so she might actually sleep with you for once in her life? Yeah... Well it turns out BBBY is far from dead and has successfully rebranded itself into an undervalued e-commerce giant poised for massive future growth!

&#x200B;

**Fundamentals:**

Despite being in the middle of a digital transformation from a retail store into an e-commerce giant while dealing with a global pandemic and supply-chain shocks, BBBY has managed to grow at a rapid pace while maintaining stable gross margins and a strong balance sheet

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/nnxg5ly14pk71.png?width=903&format=png&auto=webp&s=b50b848b70a3d734333fdd7e45d3abfea7445184

In Q1 2021, BBBY experienced 49.5% revenue growth while still increasing their gross margins to 32.4% through streamlining their operations. Additionally, their past 4 quarters of online sales have all had consecutive sales growth, breaking the seasonal trend and showing a great movement towards ecommerce

Q2 should be even better for them as they have continued streamlining operations and expect to post over 2B in revenue

BBBY has over 1.2 BILLION dollars of cash on-hand which they can use to continue moving towards e-commerce, create in-house products, and keep up growth. That cash alone is 40% of their ENTIRE market cap, not even including additional assets.

Management has seen how undervalued their company is and has repurchased $130m of shares to take advantage of this, with more share purchases to come. This shows how strong of a position they are in and how confident management is that their stock will increase in the future.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/roim01484pk71.png?width=1249&format=png&auto=webp&s=678d71fd485768434f1a2f6a50d0b97a98c0f768

Even though they are focusing on growth instead of profitability right now, BBBY’s P/E ratio is STILL in line with the S@P 500 average

&#x200B;

Ok... now that you understand how undervalued this company is, let me introduce to you the management

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Management:**

Management is one of, if not the most important factors for how well a company will do, and BBBY has some of the best management a company could hope for

&#x200B;

Mark Tritton, the current CEO, has had over 30 years of experience in retail and oversaw Target’s streamlining and digital transformation as Executive VP. He has a clear vision for the company and has the industry connections and know-how to get it done

&#x200B;

Gustavo Arnal, the current CFO, has had experience turning around struggling companies before, most notably Avon. He has experience leading WBA’s global division and can help the company reach international markets

&#x200B;

John Hartmann, the current COO, has had experience being the CEO of True Value Company which focused on hardwear. He also has experience working in Home Depot’s digital transformation program. He can help BBBY create some products of their own while guiding this digital push

&#x200B;

There are many more amazing people on the leadership team, but these 3 are the ones who stand out to me due to their unique abilities in certain fields

&#x200B;

Management is what creates and directs a company’s visions and operations. With these 3 people on their team, BBBY covers all needed areas; Digital transformation, global supply-chains, hardwear production, and financial streamlining

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Shorts:**

Despite being in such a good position, BBBY still has a 23% short interest left over from the whole meme stock surge in January(edited)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3vw8ucdd4pk71.png?width=1796&format=png&auto=webp&s=f59847892b2ab7babafd50d3d2275c3b07caa6d7

This is not enough to cause a squeeze, but what it has been doing for the past few months is providing a price floor (at around 26$) and upward momentum as shorts take the loss and move on.

&#x200B;

**Meme stocks:**  

My play is based around the fundamentals of the company, but meme stocks are so closely correlated that it makes sense to mention them

Price action with BBBY has been closely correlated with other meme stocks since the January squeeze. If my theory is correct and meme stocks have a resurgence, we could see BBBY mooning again

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ub0opfck4pk71.png?width=1352&format=png&auto=webp&s=54c47d9edcfa08ab601610c1c877b5dbc7171a61

**This play is more about how undervalued the company is, but if you believe that there will be a new meme stock cycle then buying short dated calls could work. The call options have such low open interest that they are trading way below what they should be**

**Positions:**

120 Shares, 25 30c 9/3, 25 29.5 9/10, 10 30c 9/17

**TLDR:**

BBBY is undervalued and overshorted. This provides a great long term play as the company keeps doing better and shorts keep closing their positions

If you believe there will be a new meme stock supercycle, there are plenty of cheap options you can purchase too.

&#x200B;

The analyst highlights that a consumer survey shows roughly 10% of its respondents were willing to pay for a USD 5/mth plan without ads and more analytic services. Citi estimates if such a service were to occur, it would be priced at USD 20/year internationally and USD 60/year in the US, assuming a 5% penetration for base case and 10% for its bull case with advertisements, the analyst believes the revenue contribution would be limited. Citi maintain a neutral rating.

Two companies are guaranteed to profit from the coming covid vaccine.,172,if2oxt,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/if2oxt/two_companies_are_guaranteed_to_profit_from_the/,186,2020-08-23 18:25:53,"Ask yourself who will be giving all these vaccines. Hardly anyone gets their shots at the doctors office anymore. Almost everyone get their vaccines at their local pharmacy. 

Ever wonder why the technician at the pharmacy counter is so thirsty to ask you about vaccines? They are the biggest profit driver in retail pharmacy. The average vaccine profit is around $35. I'm a pharmacist and I've given up to 70 flu shots in a single day. Do the math.

The big chains (Walgreens, Rite-Aid, and CVS) all have released statements that their internal forecasting shows a 30-50% increase in flu vaccines this year. I do not have access to stats for my company as a whole, but at my pharmacy, we have done about 30% more flu shots this year compared to this time last year. People have been hearing about covid vaccines constantly so vaccination for the flu is on their mind. 


If any of you are old enough to remember the swine flu epidemic of 2009, that was a HUGE year for pharmacy profits because we did so many more vaccines. Likewise, when a covid vaccine is released,  most will get the vaccination done at a retail pharmacy. This will lead to record-breaking profits for Rite-Aid and Walgreens. I would not invest in CVS because of internal company problems.

Are we approaching the end of supermarkets due to increased shrink? And is Costco membership model the way of the future?,1,1dpyak0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1dpyak0/are_we_approaching_the_end_of_supermarkets_due_to/,18,2024-06-27 23:54:21,"With Walgreens $WBA preparing to shut down hundreds more of their underperforming stores in the US. I wanted to look at shrink levels of Costco.  


One of the first articles I came by from last month lays it out pretty good so I'll just copy some of the data from there. 

https://www.businessinsider.com/how-costco-limits-retail-theft-checks-reciepts-2023-5


>Walmart, Target, Dollar Tree, and other major retailers have warned of rising theft rates plaguing stores across the US.

>But one company appears to be immune to the problem: Costco.

>The warehouse chain's chief financial officer, Richard Galanti, said Thursday that **shrinkage — or inventory losses due to theft, fraud, or other causes — was largely unchanged.**

> Galanti said the company saw a slight increase after the rollout of self-checkout three years ago, but those rates have since reverted to the longer-term trend.

> *T*arget**, meanwhile, has said its losses from shrinkage will balloon to more than **$1 billion in 2023, up $500 million over last year.** Walmart's CEO said in December that stores would close if theft didn't slow. Dollar Tree said this week that it was considering locking up more goods in stores as it faces rising shrink.

>Overall, theft helps drive about **$95 billion in losses every year for US retailers,** according to estimates by the National Retail Federation, an industry group.



Costco has personal information on every customer that goes through their door. Their products are in bulky large packages. and so on... 

Gist of the matter is that lack of shrinkage these days is a huge competitive advantage which directly translates to increased profits. The more competition's stores close the more shoppers Costco gets. They can reduce prices more if they need to or keep selling it at the same price as their competition. It looks like they've cornered the market for the time being. 

Obviously dollar stores are leeches that prey on small towns in the US and they are unlikely to be affected by this. But how can Walmart for example keep growing or even prevent loss of revenue over the next few years until perhaps this theft trend changes. 


Another player in this category is BJ's Wholesale Club. With larger potential for growth and a much lower PE ratio (less than half) I believe a combination of these two stocks will be guaranteed winners in the next few years.

Even with 8.5 million of you retards I still find it hard to believe that the level of stupidity we're seeing over there is just natural spillover from the enthusiasm over here.

WFC posted an earnings .01cents per share, which is down from an earnings of .93 cents per share from their previous quarter.

JPMorgan reported revenue of 28.3 Billion, which was lower than the estimated 29 Billion. They also posted an earnings per share of .78 cents, well below the 1.84 estimates. 

Both banks reportedly added billions to their reserves in anticipation for a high level of credit defaults from their customers and businesses. 

$GE, $DIS, $XOM and $WBA have all made moves in regards to securing and rolling over their credit, as fear grows that they’ll run out of credit to maintain their operations. XOM issued 9.5 Billion in debt, while DIS extended their credit line by 5billion dollars.

US Treasury Department RIGGED Data to Keep Long-Term Yield Down,8,1aeukdb,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1aeukdb/us_treasury_department_rigged_data_to_keep/,15,2024-01-30 23:23:16," Fellow Regards! Some simple lessons before we move on

1. Demand High, Supply Low → Prices go up
2. Demand Low, Supply High → Prices go down
3. Yield (rate) and price are inverse of each other. If one goes up, the other goes down

According to Wolf Ritcher, the reason for the surge in long-term (think 10 years or longer) treasury yield last quarter Q4 2023 was because the US Treasury Department “at the beginning of August that it would issue a tsunami of longer-term Treasury notes and bonds. Then three months later, at the beginning of November, the Treasury Department attempted to undo some of the damage” by stating it will issue short-term T-Bills instead.

Today, they said that not just that but they will borrow even less than estimated. This is pure BS as their own number tells us that they lied about how much they borrowed in Q3 and Q4. How can we trust their future numbers if they underestimate the borrowing? 

&#x200B;

[Surprise Surprise the US government lies to US!   Source: Wolfstreet.com](https://preview.redd.it/m6m4kv2q7mfc1.png?width=866&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce3546790713a88f8ccef8270bd0af47352b7e9c)

So why does all this matter? Well the proposed, phantom interest rate cuts are coming soon said Wall Street but that only affects short-term treasury yield. The long-term treasury yields are determined by supply and demand. Right now, with QT, demand is low while supply is high. So based on the lesson above, the prices must go down which means yield must goes up. However, Janet “The Felon” Yellen has convinced the markets that supply is low while demand is high. This causes prices to go up and yield (rate) go down. 

Here are some facts about life.

1. You will eventually die. No one lives forever. 
2. You will always pay taxes. Yes even the regard with 50k losses 
3. The US government will always spend like drunken sailors 

Do you think the US government will act fiscal responsibility this year? We are at a time where the National Debt will increase $1 Trillion every 3 months or less, and that debts must be rollover. When long-term interest rate was 1.6%, Janet “The Felon” Yellen did not lock in those rates. Yes, even regards here with mortgages while YOLOing into meme stocks were smart enough to lock in 30 years fixed at 2% or 3%. The US Treasury, with its infinite wisdom, decided to issue short-term T-Bills instead! This is like a WSB play. Now those T-Bills mature and unless they stop spending beyond their means, they must rollover all those debts at a much HIGHER interest rate! So what will happen next? 

Interest rate will stay around 4% until the people finally wise enough to know the truth! At this point, long-term yield will surge again. As the long-end goes higher, the short-end will come down or even stay the same (depending if the FED chicken out and cut rates), but the ultimate outcome is the yield curves UN-invert. This probably will happen in the summertime. When this happens, a recession will occur in 6 - 12 months. If my prediction is correct, there will be no recession this year which BTW is an election year.

# **I hope you all have an excellent trading day ahead today on this Wednesday, April 1st, 2020! :)**"
"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning April 27th, 2020",187,g7tz2d,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g7tz2d/wall_street_week_ahead_for_the_trading_week/,56,2020-04-25 19:31:15,"Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 27th, 2020.

# **Stocks face headwinds as investors look forward to a big earnings week, a Fed meeting and state reopenings  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/24/stocks-face-headwinds-as-investors-look-forward-to-a-big-earnings-week-a-fed-meeting-and-state-reopenings.html)**
*****
> The stock market is struggling to make headway, as a big week of events rolls around, including a Federal Reserve meeting, the first look at post-shutdown economic growth and earnings from more than a fifth of the S&P 500 companies.
*****
> It’s a busy week for earnings, and some of the biggest blue chips are likely to join the growing list of companies withdrawing guidance amid the uncertainty of how the coronavirus and shutdowns are impacting their business. Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, Boeing and McDonald’s are among about 140 S&P 500 companies reporting first quarter results.
*****
> Investors will also be watching the progress of the reopening of business activity in some states, like Georgia, Texas, Oklahoma and South Carolina. At the same time, President Donald Trump said he may extend social distancing guidelines into early summer. Many states, including the hardest hit, remain completely shut down.
*****
> Stocks were higher Friday, but the major indices had their first negative week in three as oil prices cratered and then steadied in the mid-teens. The S&P 500 has been trading on both sides of the key 2,800 level, as investors focused on murky corporate outlooks and uncertainty surrounding the timing of the reopening of the economy. Even though several states are resuming some activities, Trump said he disagreed with Georgia’s plan to reopen.
*****
> On Friday, the S&P closed at 2,836, down 1.3% for the week.
*****
> Earnings for the first quarter have been bleak so far, down about 14% based on estimates and actual reports, according to Refinitiv. Second quarter results are expected to be far worse, declining 32.2%.
*****
> “If you take a look where the real battle is in the market, it’s a fundamental story,” said Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse. “The fundamentals are that the market should be lower, and on the other hand, the Fed is kind of putting their thumb on the scale in favor of the market.”
*****
> Golub said it’s the potential for recurrences of the outbreak that’s being watched to see if businesses can remain open once they start back up. “People are watching what’s going on in places like Georgia, but they’re also watching what’s going on in Singapore and places in Asia that are opening up,” he said. “At the end of the day, there’s really one thing that really matters. It’s not the Fed. The virus is going to own the agenda, whether we want it to or not.”
*****
> # Fed bazooka
> The Fed meets Tuesday and Wednesday, and while it’s not expected to take any new action, it will likely discuss the many programs it quickly rolled out to support the economy and provide liquidity.
*****
> “I’m anticipating no actions in terms of anything with purchases or interest rate movements,” said Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust. “I think we’re going to hear a lot more in terms of their description of what’s working and the things that still need to happen.”
*****
> Tilley said the Fed’s job is also to instill confidence, and its asset purchase and other programs to support mortgages, corporate credit and municipal bonds, helped bring back in spreads that had been widening out across the credit markets. “It looked like we were headed for a seizure in credit markets, but they’ve come back in,” he said, adding he expects the Fed to also discuss programs like its support for the small business lending program.
*****
> Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is also expected to sound optimistic about the central bank’s ability to help the economy, despite the uncertainty as the economy falls into an unprecedented decline in the second quarter. Tilley said he expects the economy to contract in the second quarter by 40%.
*****
> Golub said this Fed meeting isn’t as important as others have been, since the central bank has already taken so many extraordinary policy steps and promises to do more as needed.
*****
> “The Fed has made it clear if they need to provide liquidity to the market, they’re not going to wait for a meeting to do it,” he said. “Whether you’re borrowing from a bank or whether you’re borrowing in the capital markets, that capital is available so the economy can move ... the net effect is it also pushes the stock market up.”
*****
> # Economic impact
> First quarter gross domestic product numbers are expected Wednesday, and it will be the first look at how the early weeks of the shutdown impacted the broader economy. Forecasts are wide ranging, and the consensus forecast from Refinitiv is now for a contraction of 4.1%. Economists expect the second quarter to take the biggest hit of the recession, and it is forecast by many to show a contraction of more than 30%.
*****
> Some of the early second-quarter data will be released in the coming week. Vehicle sales slowed to a trickle in April, and auto makers shut down production.
*****
> The impact of that should show up in Friday’s April vehicle sales and ISM manufacturing, but the single-most important data point will be Thursday’s weekly jobless claims, expected again to show millions of workers signed up for unemployment benefits.
*****
> So far, 26.5 million unemployment claims have been filed in the last five weeks, wiping out all the job gains made since the end of the Great Recession. The employment report for April will be released on May 8, and economists say unemployment will likely peak in April or May before falling off.
*****
> “We’ll probably see an unemployment rate at 20% or a little higher,” Tilley said.
*****
> # Earnings
> Earnings reports are expected from a range of industries, such as tech, health care, energy and defense. Merck, Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Humana and Anthem are among health care names reporting. Big oil companies, Exxon Mobil and Chevron both release results on Friday, and their comments on how they are reacting to the shocking decline in crude oil prices this past week will be important.
*****
> An oil futures contract for May dove into negative territory Monday and Tuesday, as did prices in many spot markets. That contract expired Tuesday, and the June futures contract for West Texas Intermediate settled at $16.94 per barrel Friday, down about 7.3% for the week and about $5 lower than the price of Brent futures.
*****
> “The most important earnings story is not what happens this quarter, It’s how long does it take to get back to peak earnings again,” said Golub. “My estimate is this is going to take three years to get back to peak profits. But the estimates right now are reflecting that it’s going to turn back to normal by something closer to the third quarter of next year. I think that’s too optimistic.The second part of the earnings story is how fast estimates are coming down.”
*****
> He said first quarter earnings per share look to be down a little more than 12%, though some estimates have them down 16% or 17%. “We had 10 very healthy weeks and three not healthy weeks. The fact you could have such a negative quarter with only three bad week, that’s really bad.” Golub said. His forecast is for a 40% decline in second quarter profits.

# Election-year Mays: DJIA’s Second Worst Month

> May officially marks the beginning of the “Worst Six Months” for the DJIA and S&P. To wit: “Sell in May and go away.” Our “Best Six Months Switching Strategy,” created in 1986, proves that there is merit to this old trader’s tale. A hypothetical $10,000 investment in the DJIA compounded to a gain of $1,068,826 for November-April in 69 years compared to just $1,461 for May-October. The same hypothetical $10,000 investment in the S&P 500 compounded to $823,326 for November-April in 69 years compared to a gain of just $9,537 for May-October.

> May has been a tricky month over the years, a well-deserved reputation following the May 6, 2010 “flash crash”. It used to be part of what we called the “May/June disaster area.” From 1965 to 1984 the S&P 500 was down during May fifteen out of twenty times. Then from 1985 through 1997 May was the best month, gaining ground every single year (13 straight gains) on the S&P, up 3.3% on average with the DJIA falling once and two NASDAQ losses.

> In the years since 1997, May’s performance has been erratic; DJIA up eleven times in the past twenty-two years (three of the years had gains in excess of 4%). NASDAQ suffered five May losses in a row from 1998-2001, down – 11.9% in 2000, followed by twelve sizable gains in excess of 2.5% and five losses, the worst of which was 8.3% in 2010. Election Year Mays rank at or near the bottom, registering net losses on DJIA and S&P 500 (since 1952), NASDAQ (since 1972) and Russell 1000 and 2000 (since 1980).

# LPL Office Talk: Putting The Rally In Perspective

> One month ago today the S&P 500 Index bottomed after a vicious bear market. Was this the ultimate bottom? We’ll have to wait and see, but what we do know is the rally we’ve seen over the past month is nearly as historic as the drop coming into it was.

> “We recently had the best 20-day rally for the S&P 500 since March 2009 and one of the best ever,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Looking back at the previous best 20-day rallies, one thing is consistent: very strong returns going out a year.”

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the 10 previous best 20-day rallies for the S&P 500 saw continued gains after some near-term volatility. In fact, six months later stocks were higher 9 of 10 times and a full year later higher 10 of 10 times.

# Why The Recent Strength Has Bulls Smiling

> The huge equity rally continued last week, with the S&P 500 Index up another 3%, on the heels of adding more than 15% in the previous week. The gain during the past two weeks of 15.5% was the greatest since October 1974. Taking it a step further, the 15 trading days ending April 14 saw the S&P 500 up more than 27%, one of the greatest rallies ever. What we’ve been seeing is truly historic, so the big question now is: What could happen next?

> “This remarkable rally has caught most off guard, but what might surprise many to hear is more gains could eventually be in store in 2020,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “When we’ve seen similar blasts of extreme short-term strength, stocks have been quite strong going out 6- to 12-months.”

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&P 500 was up nine of 10 times six months later and higher every single time a year later after the previous best 15-day gains ever. Be aware though, some of the returns in the near-term were weak, suggesting a pullback after such a strong move is likely. Still, this much strength in such a short timeframe could very well suggest the rest of 2020 could have bulls smiling.

# Dogs of the Dow Performance So Far in 2020

> The average stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 16.24% on a total return basis so far in 2020. Below we take a look at how the ""Dogs of the Dow"" strategy has performed so far this year.

> The ""Dogs of the Dow"" strategy is a very passive approach that simply says to buy the 10 stocks in the Dow 30 that have the highest dividend yields at the start of each year. The Dogs list for 2020 was led by Dow Inc. (DOW) with a yield of 5.12% on January 1st. Exxon Mobil (XOM), IBM, Verizon (VZ), Chevron (CVX), Pfizer (PFE), 3M (MMM), Walgreens (WBA), Cisco (CSCO), and Coca-Cola (KO) are the nine other members of the Dogs for 2020.

> As shown in the table below, the Dogs are down an average of 19.37% on a total return basis in 2020, which is a little less than five percentage points worse than the 14.68% decline seen for the 20 non-Dogs this year. Dow Inc. (DOW) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) have been the two worst performing Dogs with respective YTD declines of 39.9% and 37.0%. Dow's dividend yield has risen from 5.12% up to 8.47%, while XOM's yield has risen from 4.99% up to 7.91%. There are no Dogs that are up on the year, but Verizon (VZ) and Pfizer (PFE) have been the best performers of the group with YTD declines of less than 5%.

> Of the non-Dogs, Boeing (BA) has been by far the worst performer with a YTD decline of 60.01%. At the start of 2020, BA had a dividend yield of 2.52%, but that dividend has been suspended. JP Morgan (JPM), American Express (AXP) and Disney (DIS) have all fallen more than 30% YTD, while Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Walmart (WMT), and Microsoft (MSFT) are the only three Dow stocks that are up on the year.

# Investors Giving Companies a Pass on Earnings So Far

> We're now two weeks into the Q1 2020 earnings season, and just over 200 companies have reported their numbers so far. The average one-day price change for the stocks that have reported earnings so far this season has been a gain of 0.89%. That's much stronger than the average one-day gain of 0.06% seen for all stocks that have reported earnings since 2001.

> As shown below, stocks that have beaten EPS estimates this season have averaged a one-day price gain of 2.16% on their earnings reaction days. That's stronger than the average one-day gain of 1.89% seen on earnings reaction days for all stocks that have reported since 2001. Stocks that have missed EPS estimates this season have seen a one-day decline of 0.72% on their earnings reaction days. Historically, the average stock that has missed EPS has fallen 3.56% on its earnings reaction day, so this season's decline of just 0.72% suggests that investors are basically giving a pass to companies missing estimates in Q1.

# Next Week's Economic Indicators

> Even though most economic data releases this week that had forecasts exceeded those estimates (10 of 15), data continues to come in very weak. The Chicago Fed’s National Activity index started off the week coming in at –4.19 which was well below estimates of –3. Existing home sales followed up on Tuesday, and despite coming in above estimates, sales slowed considerably from February. Elsewhere in housing data, new home sales collapsed down to 627K SAAR compared to 765K last month. Meanwhile, February home prices showed some acceleration. Jobless claims also were better than expected, but they too remain at extremely elevated levels relative to the rest of history. Manufacturing data was a major area of weakness this week. Both the preliminary Markit PMI and Kansas City Fed reading fell significantly despite coming in better than forecast. Hard manufacturing data on Friday was likewise bad at the headline level though under the hood there were some silver linings.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/eco-1.png))**

> Turning to next week, like the earnings calendar, the economic calendar ramps up with a total of 34 releases. We will get the final two regional Federal Reserve indices from Dallas and Richmond on Monday and Tuesday, respectively, followed by the final Markit and ISM reading for April on Friday. Wednesday will be the most closely watched day of the week with the first release of Q1 GDP as well as an FOMC rate decision. Growth in the first quarter is expected to show a 3.8% contraction. Although no change in rates is being forecast, Fed Chair Powell’s following presser will likely be closely watched for a monetary policy update.

# Biggest Companies Reporting Earnings Next Week (AAPL, AMZN, MSFT and More)

> The earnings calendar has begun to ramp up over the past two weeks and over the next two weeks we will see peak earnings season. Next week there are a total of 784 companies scheduled to release earnings. Of those, there are 178 S&P 500 stocks, which is 35.% of the index.

> In the table below we show the 30 largest stocks (by market cap) that are scheduled to report next week. None of the largest stocks report on Monday, but the two Dow pharmaceutical stocks, Merck (MRK) and Pfizer (PFE), kick things off Tuesday morning. The trillion dollar market cap club will all report next week with Microsoft (MSFT) out with earnings Wednesday night and Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) out the following evening. Two other notable releases Wednesday and Thursday, respectively, will be the major payment processors Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA). Friday will be capped off with two oil giants: Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX). Other honorable mentions not on this list reporting next week include industrial bell-weather Caterpillar (CAT), stocks likely benefiting from the COVID economy like Colgate Palmolive (CL) and Clorox (CLX), and finally, some travel and leisure stocks like Expedia (EXPE), Royal Caribbean (RCL), United Airlines (UAL), and Southwest Airlines (LUV).

# Gold Bounces Right Where It Was Supposed To

> With central banks around the world unleashing waves of liquidity, there have been heightened concerns that one result will be a decline in the purchasing power of our money. For that reason, a number of investors have been flocking to gold. Even before the COVID-19 crisis, gold prices had been in a solid uptrend, and while prices spiked as the crisis first began, they couldn't quite get above the $1,650 - $1,700 range. In mid-March even, prices plummeted with just about every other financial asset before quickly recovering. Once again, though, the rally stalled at resistance. This time around, though, the 50-day moving average was strong enough to provide support and after that test, gold finally got the long-awaited breakout that investors had been waiting for.

> Gold's price spiked as high as $1,787 per ounce in mid-April before running out of momentum. When a stock or commodity breaks out above resistance to new highs and then pulls back, the former resistance level should act as support, and that is exactly what we saw this time around. This week, gold bounced right on cue at around $1,700 and has since rallied 2.6%. With the first test of support proving successful, look for gold to now establish a new range with a floor at around $1,700. At least that's what the technical analysis textbooks would say.

# Amazon.com, Inc. -
> **Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN)** is confirmed to report earnings at approximately 4:00 PM ET on Thursday, April 30, 2020.

#Trading Update

  * Market update – stocks rebounded throughout Asia (w/the exception of mainland China)
and the major Eurozone indices have a mild bid. US futures are up small. Nothing major
occurred overnight on the eco data/monetary fronts although there were a slew of articles
focusing on taxes and infrastructure spending. Axios says Thy God-Emperor Trump wants to couple the two
together in order to secure some support from Democrats (http://bit.ly/2obRa3v) while
Thy God-Emperor Trump may struggle to get the corporate rate much below 28% according to the NYT
(http://nyti.ms/2npLQJV). Overall the broader macro narrative stayed largely unchanged
over the last 12-18 hours (see below). The big focus on Tues will likely be on Fed speakers
(both Yellen and Fischer will be delivering comments) although Brady’s tax meeting will be
important too.

  * Calendar for Tues 3/28 – the focus will be on the US advanced goods trade balance for Feb
(8:30amET), US wholesale inventories for Feb (8:30amET), US Case-Shiller home prices for
Jan (9amET), US consumer confidence for Mar (10amET), some Fed speakers (including
Yellen at 12:50pmET and Fischer on CNBC at ~1:30pmET), Brady’s House Ways sand Means
Committee meeting (at which taxes will be discussed), Thy God-Emperor Trump’s climate change executive
order, analyst meetings (CY), and earnings (CCL, DRI, INFO, and MKC pre-open and SONC,
VRNT after the close).

  * FX/TSYs – the DXY is stabilizing after slumping ~45bp on Mon (the DXY is up ~10bp so far
Tues morning). The USD is flat vs. the EUR and JPY and is down small against the GBP.
Treasuries are pretty flat.

  * Europe – the major Eurozone indices are up ~25bp. Autos, basic resources, tech, banks,
media, and utilities are outperforming while staples, fin services, real estate, and telecoms
are lagging. Wolseley is one of the top stocks in the SXXP after posting solid earnings.
Credit Suisse said it would make a decision on capital “as soon as possible”. Ericsson was hit
at the open after issuing a restructuring update but the stock has since bounced. Redrow
said it will not make a bid for Bovis. Two of Tesco’s largest shareholders are calling on the
co to drop its bid for Booker. Akzo Nobel said it would provide a strategy update on Apr 19.

  * Asia – most of the major markets rebounded w/the exception of mainland China: Japan
(TPX +1.34%, NKY +1.14%), Hong Kong (Hang Seng +0.63%, HSCEI +0.62%), mainland China
(SHCOMP -0.43%, Shenzhen -0.25%, CSI 300 -0.24%), Taiwan (TAIEX flat), Korea (KOSPI
+0.35%), Australia (ASX 200 +1.3%), and India (up ~50bp for the major indices). There
weren’t any major macro headlines out of Asia. Within the NKY all major sub-groups saw
gains but healthcare, materials, fins, real estate, and utilities were esp. strong. SUMCO
jumped following pos. sell-side comments (the stock jumped 5.3%). Names levered to
SUMCO rallied in sympathy (Micronics, Advantest, Tokyo Electron, etc.). In Hong Kong, top
performers included Lenovo (+4.1%) and some Macau-linked stocks (Sands China +4.02%,
Galaxy +3.52%, etc.). In Taiwan large-cap tech was mixed (TSMC +0.78%, Hon Hai +0.77%
vs. Largan -1.25%, Catcher -1.5%) and fins underperformed. In Korea chemical stocks were
strong (LG Chem, Lotte Chemical, etc.) while Samsung Electronics rose 0.68%.

#US macro update

  * The bigger picture backdrop remains (frustratingly) unchanged. Healthcare was/is a net
negative for the Thy God-Emperor Trump/Ryan agenda but it is by no means fatal and so long as investors
anticipate some action on the tax front the SPX will struggle to experience significant
weakness (investors appear to appreciate that the tax process is in its very early stages and
thus are willing to wait a few more months for details). The nominal growth backdrop
remains supportive and many think the SPX would be capable of posting ~$133-135 in ’18
EPS w/o anything happening in Washington (the mid-point of that range could support the
SPX at ~2250-2300 which means there isn’t an excessive amount of political hope in
stocks). The biggest risk for the time being really isn’t political (the entire market is closely
scrutinizing Washington and near-term political expectations are low) but instead
concerns growth – sentiment around growth has grown quite upbeat (both towards real
growth and inflation) but also very complacent and risks are rising (widening gap between
surveys and hard data, soft Mar US flash PMIs, soft oil prices, etc.). It’s tough to foresee the
growth narrative turning more positive from present levels and any reversal could undercut
the $133-135 ’18 Washington-neutral EPS range. Keep in mind the calendar is pretty
sparse over the next few weeks – aside from some eco data this Fri (US/EU inflation and
China PMIs), the FOMC minutes (Wed 4/5), the Thy God-Emperor Trump/Xi summit (4/6-7), and US Mar jobs
(Fri 4/7), most investors are now looking towards the upcoming CQ1 earnings season (which
starts Thurs morning 4/13).

#Top Headlines for Tuesday

  * Thy God-Emperor Trump wants to do tax reform and infrastructure together according to Axios. Thy God-Emperor Trump feels
“burned” by the House Freedom Caucus and he knows that combining infrastructure into a
tax bill could help win some support from Democrats. Axios. http://bit.ly/2obRa3v

  * Tax overhaul – 1986 vs. 2017. An AP article looks at the differences between now and ’86 –
“tax overhaul efforts lacks advantages Reagan enjoyed in ‘86”. Reagan was popular and
worked w/powerful and experienced leaders in Congress. All the key principals had
established and trusting relationships. The situation facing President Donald Thy God-Emperor Trump
features none of those advantages. AP http://apne.ws/2mLzUoK

  * Thy God-Emperor Trump’s final tax bill, to the extent he can even achieve one, may look very different from
what he promised on the campaign trail. During the campaign Thy God-Emperor Trump talked about a 15%
corporate tax rate. That was subsequently revised to 15-20% and now people in the WH are
talking about >20%. However, Thy God-Emperor Trump’s final corporate tax rate may be as high as 28% if he
wants his plan to be revenue-neutral. Note that 28% was the same rate proposed by
Obama in ’12-’16. Most on Wall St are assuming a rate of no higher than 25%. NYT
http://nyti.ms/2npLQJV

  * Healthcare – despite the failure of ACHA, Thy God-Emperor Trump and the GOP face a big decision that
could severely undermine the public insurance exchanges. House Republicans filed a
lawsuit in 2014 to block subsides paid to insurers participating in the ACA exchanges but the
case was delayed as Ryan pursued repeal/replace. Thy God-Emperor Trump and Ryan could ask for the
lawsuit to continue as soon as May. Without these subsidies the few insurers still
participating in the exchanges would either exit the market completely or significantly raise
premiums. Even the threat of losing the premiums could have a dramatic effect. Insurers
must decide by June whether to participate in the exchanges next year. WSJ.
http://on.wsj.com/2ntDHpy

  * Schumer and McConnell headed for an “epic” clash over the Supreme Court and
government funding. Schumer is “itching for a fight” and the upcoming Gorsuch
confirmation and Apr 28 funding expiration will give him two great opportunities to wage
battle. Schumer said McConnell may not have the votes needed to break a Gorsuch
filibuster. Politico. http://politi.co/2nH8yz8

  * Republicans prob. won’t include funding for Thy God-Emperor Trump’s Mexico wall in the upcoming budget;
Republicans don’t want a shutdown battle in Apr and thus could exclude wall funding from
the budget as a result – Politico http://politi.co/2ncanQO

  * Thy God-Emperor Trump on Tues to sign an executive order that would begin the process of undoing much
of Obama’s climate agenda – Thy God-Emperor Trump’s order would instruct regulators to rewrite key rules
curbing US carbon emissions, lift a moratorium on federal coal leasing, and remove the
requirement that federal officials consider the impact of climate change when making
decisions. Most of the Thy God-Emperor Trump order will take years to implement and is unlikely to alter
the shift away from coal and towards nat. gas and renewables. Washington Post.
http://wapo.st/2mLwUbQ

  * Thy God-Emperor Trump’s climate order won’t help either energy independence or coal mining employment
– the US already consumes all its own coal and coal mining jobs have been cut by
automation and increased nat. gas demand. NYT http://nyti.ms/2nven2f

  * Company-specific news update from Tues morning. Wolseley is one of the top stocks in
the SXXP after posting solid earnings. Credit Suisse said it would make a decision on capital
“as soon as possible”. Ericsson was hit at the open after issuing a restructuring update but
the stock has since bounced. Redrow said it will not make a bid for Bovis. Two of Tesco’s
largest shareholders are calling on the co to drop its bid for Booker. Akzo Nobel said it
would provide a strategy update on Apr 19.

  * Company-specific news update from Mon night. RHT’s results were strong, esp. the blowout
billings number for the Feb-end Q. SNX also was solid (better Feb-end results and inline
earnings). DRI reported earnings ahead of the St and announced plans to buy Cheddar’s for
$780MM in cash. Red Mountain sent a letter to DECK’s board and called on the co to
explore strategic alternatives. HOMB announced plans to buy SGBK. ALXN named a new
CEO.
 
  * China/semiconductors – Tsinghua Unigroup, China’s largest chipmaker, has secured ~$22B
in financing to pursue M&A and build production capacity. Unigroup is in the process of
building a massive ~$30B memory plant. China in total plans to spend $150B over the next
10 years to secure a leading position in the global semi industry. Bloomberg.
http://bloom.bg/2otzBvd

  * CMCSA – the co is planning to rebrand and expand its streaming TV product. The new
service, which will be marked as Xfinity Instant TV, will cost $15-40/month and will be made
available to the >50MM homes within the CMCSA footprint. Reuters.
http://cnb.cx/2o1b4RC

  * Bond buyers return w/a vengeance – the WSJ discusses the recent rally in Treasuries as
“Thy God-Emperor Trump Trades” reverse. WSJ. http://on.wsj.com/2otqfQb

  * Italy – despite all the anxiety around Thy God-Emperor Trump and France, the market’s biggest political risk is
still Italy. WSJ. http://on.wsj.com/2ndmKgq

  * Iranian oil minister says global oil cuts deal likely to be extended – Reuters
http://reut.rs/2mLA8fu

 * Bank lending update from JPM’s D Silver - commercial bank lending has cooled notably in
recent months. Bank lending often weakens around recessions, and there has been some
concern over the recent slowing. But there are also a few instances in which bank lending
firmed again after a mid-expansion moderation, and we are not especially alarmed by the
recent slowing in the data. Given many signs that business investment has strengthened
more recently, we think the bank lending data will eventually firm. http://bit.ly/2o16zXg

 * Wall St research – Reuters discusses the “period of turmoil” facing the research industry
due to upcoming regulatory changes. Online research portals could gain share at the
expense of “bulge bracket” investment banks. According to one study, ~40K research
reports are produced every week by the world’s top 15 global investment banks but only 1%
are actually consumed by clients. Reuters http://reut.rs/2oc0Riq

#Washington – what comes next?

 * The next major issue to be addressed in Washington concerns the budget as the present
spending authorization is due to expire on Apr 28 – failure to sign a new budget (or a
Continuing Resolution) by that date could result in a “shutdown”. A shutdown on its own
wouldn’t be a major headache for stocks or the economy although at this time on gov’t
stoppage would probably have negative consequences as it 1) would reinforce the message
sent by the ACHA failure of Washington being hopelessly deadlocked and 2) raise doubts
about Washington acting smoothly on the debt ceiling (the debt ceiling probably doesn’t
have to be raised until later in the summer or early fall).

  * On taxes, the GOP is aggressively pivoting but there is a lot of work left to do. The
Ryan/Brady BAT bill is the only tax legislation that actually exists but (as has the case for
months) this bill can’t pass the Senate; if Ryan insists on commencing the tax debate w/his
BAT blueprint as the base case that could cause months of contentious negotiations and
drag the process into the fall at least (Brady’s House Ways and Means Committee has a
meeting Tues 3/28 at which it will discuss taxes). Thy God-Emperor Trump will play a big role – the White
House largely outsourced healthcare to Ryan but by getting involved early w/taxes it could
help steer the process towards a bill capable of passing both the House and Senate.

  * Without BATs and the ACHA savings it will be very difficult for any tax legislation to be
“revenue neutral” which means the GOP will have to 1) secure some Democratic support in
the Senate to overcome a likely filibuster or 2) sunset any changes after 10 years (like the
George W Bush tax cuts). Erstwhile GOP deficit hawks seem a bit more amenable to
unfinanced tax cuts (Meadows, the chair of the House Freedom Caucus, this weekend said
taxes don’t have to be revenue neutral) but they are unlikely to countenance enormous
deficits.
 

  * The market right now assumes the corporate rate can be cut to ~25% (or lower) when all is
said and done – anything higher than that number is likely to underwhelm. The “easiest”
bill to pass would likely be some combination of a repatriation holiday and infrastructure
spending (this is likely going to be the fallback solution if taxes stay deadlocked into the late
fall) although passing either alone would likely foreclose the possibility of broader tax
action. Markets appreciate that tax reform won’t happen by Aug and most don’t even think
it can happen this year. However, investors are hoping to see a credible and passable
blueprint by the fall that can get to Thy God-Emperor Trump’s desk by early 2018.

#Calendar of events to watch for the week of Mon Mar 27

  * There aren’t many major events scheduled this week other than some eco data (the most
important of which will likely be the US Feb PCE on Fri 3/31) and a few earnings reports.

home sales for Feb (10amET), some Fed speakers (Evans, Rosengren, and Williams), some

SCWX, UNF pre-open and LULU and WOR after the close).

NATO member at this event; Thy God-Emperor Trump will attend.

  * G7 Leaders Summit May 26-27 in Italy.

  * US financial regulatory review – the Treasury will present recommendations to Thy God-Emperor Trump
around the end of May/start of June on ways to ease financial regulations.

  * Italy – new elections could take place in the June timeframe (although the odds of this
happening have receded). If elections aren’t held in June, the next possible date would be

#US – healthcare

  * Healthcare – despite the failure of ACHA, Thy God-Emperor Trump and the GOP face a big decision that
could severely undermine the public insurance exchanges. House Republicans filed a
lawsuit in 2014 to block subsides paid to insurers participating in the ACA exchanges but the
case was delayed as Ryan pursued repeal/replace. Thy God-Emperor Trump and Ryan could ask for the
lawsuit to continue as soon as May. Without these subsidies the few insurers still
participating in the exchanges would either exit the market completely or significantly raise
premiums. Even the threat of losing the premiums could have a dramatic effect. Insurers
must decide by June whether to participate in the exchanges next year. WSJ.

  * Paul Ryan says House Republicans will continue their push for healthcare reform this year
– Washington Post. http://wapo.st/2ndt87a

  * Healthcare/taxes – Republicans won’t look to repeal ACA taxes as part of tax reform –
Reuters http://reut.rs/2nZthz4

#US – fiscal policy

  * Thy God-Emperor Trump wants to do tax reform and infrastructure together according to Axios. Thy God-Emperor Trump feels
“burned” by the House Freedom Caucus and he knows that combining infrastructure into a
tax bill could help win some support from Democrats. Axios. http://bit.ly/2obRa3v

  * Tax overhaul – 1986 vs. 2017. An AP article looks at the differences between now and ’86 –
“tax overhaul efforts lacks advantages Reagan enjoyed in ‘86”. Reagan was popular and
worked w/powerful and experienced leaders in Congress. All the key principals had
established and trusting relationships. The situation facing President Donald Thy God-Emperor Trump
features none of those advantages. AP http://apne.ws/2mLzUoK

  * Thy God-Emperor Trump’s final tax bill, to the extent he can even achieve one, may look very different from
what he promised on the campaign trail. During the campaign Thy God-Emperor Trump talked about a 15%
corporate tax rate. That was subsequently revised to 15-20% and now people in the WH are
talking about >20%. However, Thy God-Emperor Trump’s final corporate tax rate may be as high as 28% if he
wants his plan to be revenue-neutral. Note that 28% was the same rate proposed by
Obama in ’12-’16. Most on Wall St are assuming a rate of no higher than 25%. NYT
http://nyti.ms/2npLQJV

  * Republicans prob. won’t include funding for Thy God-Emperor Trump’s Mexico wall in the upcoming budget;
Republicans don’t want a shutdown battle in Apr and thus could exclude wall funding from
the budget as a result – Politico http://politi.co/2ncanQO

  * US gov't shutdown risks not appreciated by markets – Axios update (this was out Mon
morning) - ""A top Republican with close ties to the White House tells me that after the GOP
failure on healthcare, a government shutdown — looming when a continuing resolution runs
out April 28 — is ""more likely than not... Wall Street is not expecting a shutdown and the
markets are unprepared"" - http://bit.ly/2nmX9CB

#US – economic growth, monetary policy

  * Bond buyers return w/a vengeance – the WSJ discusses the recent rally in Treasuries as
“Thy God-Emperor Trump Trades” reverse. WSJ. http://on.wsj.com/2otqfQb

  * States expect tax revenue to grow at a slower clip going forward than in the decades
preceding the financial crisis. The average state assumes income tax revenue growth of
3.6% in F17 (down from +4% last year) w/sales tax +3.1% (down from +4.2%). The Hill.

  * Fed’s Evans thinks three rate hikes this year is plausible and four are possible if inflation
picks up – WSJ http://on.wsj.com/2nvlx6B

  * Former Atlanta Fed President Lockhart thinks the US economy is on a solid footing but he
warns growth could be undermined by political disruptions – WSJ.
http://on.wsj.com/2nFmREI

#US – domestic policy

  * Schumer and McConnell headed for an “epic” clash over the Supreme Court and
government funding. Schumer is “itching for a fight” and the upcoming Gorsuch
confirmation and Apr 28 funding expiration will give him two great opportunities to wage
battle. Schumer said McConnell may not have the votes needed to break a Gorsuch
filibuster. Politico. http://politi.co/2nH8yz8

  * Thy God-Emperor Trump on Tues to sign an executive order that would begin the process of undoing much
of Obama’s climate agenda – Thy God-Emperor Trump’s order would instruct regulators to rewrite key rules
curbing US carbon emissions, lift a moratorium on federal coal leasing, and remove the
requirement that federal officials consider the impact of climate change when making
decisions. Most of the Thy God-Emperor Trump order will take years to implement and is unlikely to alter
the shift away from coal and towards nat. gas and renewables. Washington Post.
http://wapo.st/2mLwUbQ
 

  * Thy God-Emperor Trump’s climate order won’t help either energy independence or coal mining employment, the US already consumes all its own coal and coal mining jobs have been cut by
automation and increased nat. gas demand. NYT http://nyti.ms/2nven2f

  * Congress/Thy God-Emperor Trump/Russia – calls grow for Nunes to step aside on Russia inquires. NYT

Welcome to the new trading week and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market movers and news this AM-

*****

#[Today's Top Headlines for Monday, March 30th, 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/30/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-march-30-2020.html)

*****

> * U.S. stock futures were pointing to a modest decline for the Dow Jones Industrial Average at Monday’s open after President Donald Trump extended national social distancing guidelines to April 30. The Dow, which closed 4% lower Friday, did soar 12.8% for the week, logging its best weekly gain since 1938 and raising questions about whether blue chips have bottomed. However, heading into Monday’s session, the Dow was still nearly 27% off last month’s record highs. The yield on the 10-year Treasury remained below 1% early Monday. U.S. oil prices sank below $20 per barrel, near 18-year lows hit earlier this month.

*****

> * On Sunday, mortgage bankers warned that Federal Reserve mortgage purchases are unbalancing the home lending market. In addition to the Fed’s extraordinary no limit fixed-income purchases, Wall Street analysts and economists said it would not be out of the question to see the central bank take for the first time ever a passive interest in the performance of the stock market.

*****

> * Preparing the nation for a death toll that could exceed 100,000 from the coronavirus, Trump on Sunday walked back his previous remarks about wanting to reopen the country for business by Easter. In continuing social distancing until the end of next month, the president said, “Nothing would be worse than declaring victory before the victory has been won.” Earlier on Sunday, White House health advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said the country could see up to 200,000 deaths and millions of infections. However, he also cautioned that those numbers are based on outbreak modeling and nothing is certain.

*****

> * The U.S., which has the most known coronavirus infections in the world, saw confirmed cases jump to over 143,000 with 2,513 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University data. New York has about 40% of those cases and fatalities. A field hospital has been set up inside New York’s Central Park to treat coronavirus patients. Abbott Laboratories, which received FDA emergency use authorization on Friday for a test that can detect coronavirus in 5 minutes, was praised by Trump. “Abbott has stated that they will begin delivering 50,000 tests each day, starting this week,” he said. Abbott shares were soaring about 8% in the premarket.

*****

> * Global coronavirus cases increased to over 730,000 with 34,685 deaths and more than 149,000 recoveries. Italy, No. 2 to the U.S. in cases with about 97,700, has the worst death toll. Italy’s 10,779 fatalities are more than three times as many as China’s 3,308 deaths. Rounding out the top three, Spain just surpassed China in infections, with over 85,000 cases and more than double China’s death toll at 6,803. China, where the pandemic started in December, has the world’s fourth most known infections, nearing 82,200 cases. Germany is No. 5 in worldwide cases at about 62,400. It has 541 deaths.

*****

> * Amazon warehouse workers in Staten Island, one of the five boroughs of New York City, plan to strike on Monday to call attention to what they claim is the lack of protections for employees. Chris Smalls, a management assistant and a lead organizer of the strike, told CNBC that workers at the fulfillment center known as JFK8, have grown increasingly concerned about coming into work after an employee tested positive for the coronavirus there last week. Amazon told CNBC that the company was supporting the individual in quarantine and asked anyone who was in contact with the worker to stay home with pay for two weeks. JFK8 remains open.

"RITE AID ( RAD ) AFTER HOURS ON EVE OF Q1 EARNINGS ANNOUCNEMENT HEADLINE READS: ""Rite Aid CEO - Our vaccine rollout was much bigger than expected"". [Stock is rising after hours on comments by CEO. Earnings announcement due out before market open Thursday, June 24, 2021.]",36,o6mlu5,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o6mlu5/rite_aid_rad_after_hours_on_eve_of_q1_earnings/,38,2021-06-24 03:07:14,"\[NOTE: The following article was released on June 23, 2021 at 4:40 PM ET\]

**Inundated with people trying to get a vaccine**

When Rite Aid ( $RAD ) stepped up to help distribute coronavirus vaccines as part of the nationwide rollout, the demand was overwhelming. 

“We never thought we would get inundated with people trying to get a vaccine,” Rite Aid CEO Heyward Donigan said in a discussion panel moderated by Yahoo Finance Editor in Chief Andy Serwer as part of the Milken Institute's Future of Health Summit. The panel also featured Medtronic ( MDT ) CEO Geoff Martha and Labcorp ( LH ) CEO Adam Schechter.

""There was no battle for turf” between the different drugstore chains like CVS ( $CVS ), Walgreens ( $WBA ), and Rite Aid, Donigan added. “It was just all-hands-on-deck with the labs and anybody else that you could get to help you because at this point, you're not trying to save the company, you're trying to save the world.” 

According to Donigan, one of the biggest challenges Rite Aid faced in meeting the unprecedented demand for the COVID-19 vaccine was creating an appointment scheduling platform. It was especially difficult for certain jurisdictions like Pennsylvania, which did not have scheduling tools for vaccines.

Prior to the coronavirus pandemic, patients could walk in to receive vaccines for shingles or pneumonia, or get a flu or strep test. However, this all changed over the past year and a half when Rite Aid realized the need for an effective scheduling system that allows patients to book their own appointments.

“We developed, in partnership with many of these different jurisdictions, our own scheduling tool, and that was pretty intense,” Donigan said. “You wouldn't think it would be that intense, but it actually has taken us many months to get this tool up and running in a way that is really user-friendly.”

 **Adapting to the pandemic**

Even before the onset of the pandemic, Donigan said that Rite Aid already placed a “significant emphasis” on incorporating digital technology into the customer experience. She cited Rite Aid’s mobile app, new website, and new digital experiences for its pharmacy benefit management (PBM) business, in which Rite Aid serves as a Medicare Part D insurance company that covers prescriptions for seniors.

And in addition to its pharmacy business and PBM company, Rite Aid also has a significant amount of front-end retail business. She stated that the pandemic pushed the company towards improving their e-commerce fulfillment capabilities, an area in which they were lagging behind prior to the pandemic.

“Our digital capabilities were accelerated significantly during the pandemic,” Donigan said. “We're actually pretty fortunate in that we were able to respond as quickly and take advantage of these 180% growth rates that many \[retailers\] saw in the digital space.” 

The pandemic also forced Rite Aid to shift its clinic staff to be able to fulfill telehealth consultation roles in a very short time frame, Donigan said. She emphasized Rite Aid’s pharmacists roles as being the main facilitators between patients and health systems. 

Although Rite Aid is incorporating telehealth in its in-store consultation and new virtual care rooms, Donigan noted that telehealth will not become a main component of the drugstore chain’s business.

“Going forward, we're focused exclusively on our pharmacy,” Donigan said. “And so we are in the process of considering a launch of a teleRX business where \[patients can\] do telepharmacy consults with a provider who can then prescribe a prescription that can get filled in our stores.”

Donigan also emphasized that Rite Aid was not acquired by Walgreens, and still remains an independent, publicly-traded organization. However, she stated that the company did sell some stores to Walgreens, which is reflected in Rite Aid’s $25 billion projected annual revenue this year."

"Rite Aid ( RAD ) Earnings Due Out Next Week - June 24, 2021. Strong results due to COVID-19 vaccinations administered could be a catalyst for the stock price to climb higher.",26,o2ww7t,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o2ww7t/rite_aid_rad_earnings_due_out_next_week_june_24/,41,2021-06-19 00:03:22,"As we head into next week (week of Jun 21, 2021) with Rite Aid ( $RAD ) set to report fiscal Q1 earnings of Thursday, June 24th, some points to consider:  
  
1) The market cap of the stock is now right around one billion dollars. Does that sound reasonable for a company with $24 billion in annual revenue, positive cash flow, and $8 per share in adjusted EBITDA last year (during a COVID-19 stressed year, no less)?  
  
2) The company provided guidance for the new / current Q1 of their 2022 fiscal year and indicated a break-even result +/- $10 million. This represents a net earnings improvement of $63 to $83 million versus the prior year.  
  
3) RAD management indicated they had administered 2 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine during the first six weeks of the new / current fiscal year. Through the first half of the year, it appears 6 million doses will likely be delivered by Rite Aid. This will result in $210 million in incremental revenue and $2 per share to net earnings. Also, Pfizer's CEO mentioned today (April 15, 2021) that a third booster coronavirus shot will likely be required and that we should expect the COVID-19 vaccine to be administered annually like the flu shot.  
  
4) The short attacks on the stock have ramped up against RAD recently.  Short interest is up to 15.5% of the total outstanding shares.  That represents 8.33 million shares short.  Institutions, mutial funds, and insiders own more than 60% of the total shares outstanding.  That means that 35.8% to 46.3% shares are short excluding ownership by institutions, mutual funds, and insiders.  **Positive earnings on June 24th could be a catalyst for a major squeeze.**   
5) The Bartell Drugs acquisition closed at the start of 2021.  While it is unlikely to contribute materially to net earnings during the current fiscal year, it is expected to do so next year. The acquisition makes Rite Aid the pharmacy leader in the Seattle market.  
  
6) Year-to-Date high share price is $32.48 and there are only 55 millioin shares total outstanding.  
  
7) The company has $3.1 billion in debt, which is being adequately managed (---meaning Rite Aid was able to service the debt, buy Bartell drugs, and still maintain positive cash flow last year). For the new / current fiscal year, it appears likely that Rite Aid is positioned to book positive net earnings and cash flow (improving cash flow even further).  
  
8) Break-up value of the company is estimated to be in the range of $40 - $50 per share.  This despite a current share price of under $21.  

Does this sound like a company that should be trading at less than $21 per share with a market cap of just $1 billion?"

This Weeks News & Current Events,107,g3g4ae,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g3g4ae/this_weeks_news_current_events/,33,2020-04-18 08:16:14,"I do a write ups on news through out the week that is either market related or could influence the market. I summarize from multiple sources so if you see an error blame CNBC or WSJ. 

  
This is what happened this week.   
 

04/11 - JP Morgan and other lenders are beginning to increase their mortgage borrowing requirements as they foresee a downturn in the housing market. They fear rising unemployment, sudden pay cuts, decreasing home values, in combination with social distancing guidelines will have a very negative impact and are looking to decrease their risk exposure. For the 2nd half of March, requests to delay mortgage payments increased by 1,900%. An alarming figure that even JPow might not have an answer for.

04/11 - It should be a surprise to no one that the numbers are not adding up with a swift economic rebound in China. Despite posting a much improved PMI number, China's pollution data last measured on April 5th, was determined to be at its lowest point since the outbreak began in Wuhan. Chinese coal use and property sale are still well below their pre-virus numbers indicating their factories are not ramping up to full production. Mayor Bill De Blasio stated that New York schools will remain closed until next fall, although Governor Andrew Cumo said he was the only one with the power to make such a declaration. Italy has extended its lock down to May 3rd. India is extending its lock down an additional 2 weeks to the end of April, and Trump has begun to take the stance that the US economy will not reopen until it is best for public health. He is assembling a ""Opening our country"" task force to determine when the US will be able to ease restrictions due to the virus. 

Spain and Austria plan on allowing small non-essential businesses to reopen while the lockdown in Wuhan, China has officially ended. Although outside arrivals to china has raised concerns in Beijing and Hong Kong about spreading a second wave as they logged an additional 34 new cases, all attributed to arrivals from overseas.

04/11 - Mexico over the weekend decided to play hard ball and would only make an oil cut of 100,000 barrels per day. Saudi Arabia was not happy with this and said they would only reduce their supply to 8.2 million bpd if Mexico cut their fair share too. US panicked and got on the phone with Mexico and Trump agreed that the US would cut an additional 250,000 bpd to make up for what Mexico refused to cut. OPEC agreed to cuts of 10 million bpd during May and June, then an 8 mil bpd cut from July to the end of the year, followed by a 6mil bpd cut from January 2021-2022 As of right now, it is estimated that there is a current demand loss of 20-35 million bpd while quarantines stay in affect.

\*\*\*UPDATE - A deal was finalized on Sunday with sources reporting that G20 countries will be cutting an additional 3.3 million barrels, in addition to the 10 million vowed by OPEC. IEA also plans to announce oil purchases on 04/13 adding to their reserve which will reduce the amount of oil on the market \*\*\*

04/12 - SoftBank Vision fund seems to be going through some difficulties to put it mildly. They are forecasting that 15 companies within the fund are expected to go bankrupt, while other companies they are significantly invested in such as uber, have heightened exposure to the Covid 19 pandemic. 

In recent weeks, Softbank withdrew its offer to buy 3 billion dollars worth of WeWork stock due to concerns over their ability to meet various closing conditions. WeWork has now filed a lawsuit against SoftBank for withdrawing their offer. SoftBank So far has invested 14.3 Billion dollars into WeWork, their biggest investment, which by all appearances seems to be largely failing throughout the US.

Uber has been another strain on WeWork, since the ride sharing service has seen a 40-60% decline in rides since the pandemic began. With multiple failed IPO, upcoming bankruptcies, and 40% of their fund being exposed to transportation and logistics, SoftBanks vision fund at the least may be screwed for a while. 

UPDATE. On 04/13 SoftBank announced a 16.7Billion dollar write down on the value of the vision fund. This write down reflects a loss of 9.9 Billion dollars of value in the quarter ending in March, wiping out their cumulative gains of 9.5 Billion through December

04/12 - Democrats and Republicans are getting ready to provide more relief to Americans through the CARES act. The Cares act initially provided 2 trillion dollars worth of relief to individuals and businesses but now Democrat and Republican leaders are saying it's not enough. New additions to the current CARES act could add more than 1 trillion in additional relief. The funding would mostly be targeted to small businesses, unemployment aid, and possibly a 2nd round of stimulus check to each household. Banks which began taking applications for small business loans last week, were quickly stretched to their limit. BofA took in over 177,000 applications requesting a total of 36.2 Billion in financing. While Wells Fargo quickly reached their cap of 10 billion they planned on giving out in small business loans. Confusion remained among small business owners about what exactly the criteria was for receiving this money, and many found themselves ineligible to file with their bank due to current guidelines. As of Wednesday the Small Business Association said it has received over 381,000 applications for small business loans totaling over $100 Billion dollars. President Trump also made statements that no additional funding would be provided for the US post office and that he would not sign off on any bill that attempted to do so. The US post office has requested 75 billion to help them maintain operations. Some fear without some sort of stimulus for the post office, they will not be able to operate through the summer in current economic conditions. 

04/13 - Soon, money might not even matter when we’re unable to actually eat. Globally, food processing plants have seen up to a third of their workers walk off the job, or not show up at all as they fear for their safety due to Covid 19. The closing of global economies has presented unique challenges for various parts of the food industry. While demand has dropped drastically from the restaurant sector, there's been a surge in orders from grocery stores for beef and pork. Add that to the lack of workers, processing plants are struggling to keep up with demand, while various plants all around the globe have shut down temporarily due to outbreaks or significantly reduce demand within their specific sector. Smith Field food, the world largest pork processor has shut down one of their pork processing plants which accounts for 4-5% of the US production. JBUS in Colorado announced they will be shutting down their beef plant temporarily which accounts for 5% of US supply. Additional closures in the industry are anticipated. 

Dairy has also been hit hard, as they see their demand plummet. The issue has become so bad that dairy processing plants are dumping out the milk due to oversupply. Farmers claim the issue is that cows simply can’t stop producing milk on demand. So dairy supply is likely to continue outpacing demand.

Globally crop workers have stopped showing up to work, or are not being allowed to travel to work, which is leading to rotting crops. The fruit that is salvageable has nowhere to go due to a lack of shipping containers, and competitive demand for air cargo space. The lack of workers also causes concerns that we’re missing our short window to plant fruit and vegetables for future harvest. 

To add insult to injury, sudden layoffs and furloughs have created an unprecedented influx of mouths to feed for food banks in the US and Europe. Some food banks have reported running out of food within just hours. A problem that many think will only get worse the longer world economies remain under lockdown. 

 04/13 GE has made a move to replace all their short term debt with long term debt that will push the due date to 2024. The move is said to be debt neutral and will not add onto the total amount of debt that GE owes. Currently GE has $35 billion in bonds due between now and 2024. 

04/13 A chapter 11 bankruptcy is looking more and more likely for AMC movie theaters. On Monday 04/13 they were downgraded from neutral to sell out of fears they are running out of liquidity options and won't be able to rebound or even open after the quarantine. AMC has started taking drastic measures to keep it's doors open though the shut downs. All 600 of AMC corporate employees have been furloughed, and they have told their landlords that they will not be paying rent for the month of April. Their rent is currently 250 million per quarter. 

04/13 Governors of democratic states are taking lockdown easement measures into their own hands. California and Oregon have joined New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts in saying they will rely on health & economic officials to determine when to reopen their economy. This caused backlash from president Trump who tweeted out that it is ultimately the Federal government who holds the power to determine when states could begin to reopen. There has been no official date discussed on when the economy may reopen, but some governors believe that the lockdowns could extend beyond May 1st. Overall it seems to be the stance of the Democrats that everyone must be healthy before we worry about the health of the economy. Republicans have pushed for reopening the economy sooner than later while practicing social distancing fearing the longer we remain quarantined, the less likely a quick economic recovery becomes. 

04/14 - To kick off earnings season Wells Fargo reported revenue of 17.78billion, which was lower than the expected 19.35 Billion. WFC posted an earnings .01cents per share, which is down from an earnings of .93 cents per share from their previous quarter. Their net income also dropped a staggering 89% to $653 million for this quarter. 

JPMorgan reported revenue of 28.3 Billion, which was lower than the estimated 29 Billion. They also posted an earnings per share of .78 cents, well below the 1.84 estimates. 

Both banks reportedly added billions to their reserves in anticipation for a high level of credit defaults from their customers and businesses. 

$GE, $DIS, $XOM and $WBA have all made moves in regards to securing and rolling over their credit, as fear grows that they’ll run out of credit to maintain their operations. XOM issued 9.5 Billion in debt, while DIS extended their credit line by 5billion dollars. 

Companies such as $F, $M, $DAL, and $GPS, have seen their Corporate bonds ratings drop to Junk bond status. Although the Fed has announced that they will be making purchases within the junk bond market. 

Some estimates are predicting that the airline industry could take a 300billion dollar hit this year. 

Vaccine manufacturers are under pressure to create vaccines faster than ever before, due to the belief that the economy can’t truly return back to normal until we have a vaccine. For every day the economy is shut down, it is estimated the US loses 25Billion dollars.

WeWork will not be paying their Manhattan rent for this month, joining a growing list of companies who told their landlords they will not be paying rent**.** WeWork is currently the largest tenant in Manhattan paying $500 million dollars a year in rent**.** The Cheesecake factory, and AMC are other notable names who have also told landlords they will not paying rent. 

This has all been seen as fantastic news to investors, and reason to be bullish. Markets have now regained about 50% of their losses from March after having their best week in decades last week, the NASDAQ is on its longest winning streak since December, and the S&P500 is trading at 35x earnings. $TSLA is back above $700, and most tech stocks are racing towards their ATHs. 

04/16 - The IEA, which is seen as a more neutral player in the oil industry in comparison to OPEC that provides accurate information, found that Oil demand was down by 29M BPD for the month of April. They estimate overall, oil demand will fall by approximately 9.3M BPD for the year of 2020. Under the current OPEC deal, OPEC countries will cut approx 9M bpd starting May until June, then 8M BDP for the rest of the year after that. Globally oil reserves are starting to fill up due to excess demand, and the US is forecasting their oil reserves will be full by summer. Trump is considering paying US Shale companies to cut back on production to prevent this from happening. 

As of 04/16 unemployment claims have increased to 23 million, as 5M more americans filed for unemployment benefits the previous week. Economists predicted that the US would have an unemployment rate of 12% by the end of the month, while some payroll indicators predict that we may already be at 16% unemployment midway through April. 

The Small Business Association has run out of 350Billion in funds approved by congress to loan to small businesses affected by the Corona Virus. The reported figures vary, but somewhere between 1.6 - 1.9M applications have been approved for loans, while over 3M applications have been submitted. The SBA says they can approve no more additional applications until congress secures more funding for the PPP (payroll protection program). Congress is in talks to add an additional 250B in funding for the program. Democrats refuse to support the current bill, and are requesting billions more in funding be added for hospitals and local governments. 

**\*\*UPDATE\*\*** 23% of the SBA loans went to California, New York, and Texas receiving a total of 81billion in loans. Retail, food and accomodation accounted for less than 9% of the approved loans despite being the industries hit hardest by the Corona virus. Construction firms received 13% of all loans,. 

After markets closed on Thursday, Gilead $GILD announced positive results from their clinical drug trials being conducted at The University of Chicago Hospital. Their antiviral drug Remdesivir was identified as one of few that may be effective at combating Covid-19. Out of 125 patients enrolled, 113 were classified as severe covid cases. Out of the 125 only 2 died during the trial, and “a majority of the patients enrolled in the trial have already been discharged from the hospital” although the exact number of patients discharged was not given. It is noteworthy that there was no placebo group included with this study. Also this drug will only work for patients already infected with covid-19 and does not act as a vaccine. 

The white house has released a list of guidelines for states to follow when reopening their counties. Withdrawing from his previous stance, Trump has now said he’ll leave it up to the governors to decide when their state/counties have satisfied the requirements for reopening. The guidelines suggest that “Regions see a decline in documented cases over a 14 day period, ensure hospitals can treat all patients without crisis care, have a robust testing program in place and antibody testing for at risk healthcare workers.” The guidelines are to be followed in 3 different phases with each phase allowing more sectors of the economy to open up while still following social distancing measures. It is still believed by many physicians and economists that the social distancing measures will have to stay in place until an actual vaccine is developed. 

Boeing $BA also announced after the markets closed that they will be resuming production of their commercial airplanes. The announcement by $BA in combination with $GILD clinical trials and reopening guidelines sent futures higher heading into Friday. At the time of writing this the Dow Jones is up 860 points in the futures market.   

04/17 - Apple $AAPL received a downgrade this morning from Goldman Sachs from *neutral* to *sell* over concerns that iPhones sales would slump due to Corvid 19. $AMZN, $NFLX are also down by greater than 2% which seems to be weighing down on the rally everyone had hoped for, although the day is still green overall. $MRNA is up over 15% over hopes of a vaccine and federal funding, $BA is up by 13% due to revamping production of their commercial planes, and $TSLA continues to inch higher towards $800. As of midday, $TSLA is trading at $756.

04/17 - The race to create a vaccine for Covid 19 is still in full effect as Moderna $MRNA is set to receive $483 Million from the federal government to accelerate the development of a vaccine. Phase one for the vaccine is already underway with patients being vaccinated in March. The additional money from the government will go towards supporting Phase 2 & 3 of development. 

In the UK a million doses of a potential vaccine are already being developed, though the vaccine is still being tested in trials and has not been approved. It is estimated that production of the vaccine will be ready by September. The company developing the vaccine is putting itself at great financial risk by starting early production, because if the vaccine proves to be ineffective or is not approved then it can not be distributed to the public population. No official number was given, only that production costs tens of millions of dollars. There are currently over 70 vaccines under development with at least 5 of those already in the human trial phase."

#Trading Update

  * What’s happening this morning? It was another quiet night of news. Stocks in Asia were
mixed (Japan, Taiwan, and Australia saw pressure while mainland China and HK did well) but
Eurozone equities are trading lower across the board (and US futures are down small).
There were no major headlines in the last 12-18 hours, neither on the macro nor micro
fronts. Treasury yields rose Mon but are reversing that entire move so far Tues. Crude
spiked Mon morning on the Qatar news before bleeding lower throughout the day amid
worries the rift could imperil the OPEC/Russia production deal (oil is flat-to-down small so
far Tues morning; there are some indications that countries like Kuwait are working to
mediate the Qatar diplomatic crisis). Europe is being led lower by basic resources,
chemicals, retail, and healthcare (Roche is a big laggard in the last category on back of
downbeat data; in general ASCO hasn’t been kind to large caps w/BMY getting hit Mon due
to news out of the conf.). The week’s big events are coming up on Thurs (ECB, Comey, UK
election).
  * Calendar for Tues June 6 – the focus will be on Emperor Coffeve’s meeting w/Congressional GOP
leaders (the focus is on jumpstarting Emperor Coffeve’s legislative agenda), the US JOLTs report for
Apr (10amET), some analyst meetings (M, MDP, and PRU), earnings (CONN, CSIQ, FRAN,
FRED, HDS, LE, MIK, and SCWX pre-open and AMBA, HQY, KEYS, OXM, PLAY, SEAC, and
UNFI after the close), and a slew of conferences.
  * Europe – the major indices are trading down ~30bp. Autos, basic resources, chemicals,
media, retail, and healthcare are leading on the downside while staples, real estate, energy,
and utilities are outperforming. Lufthansa is rallying following pos. remarks from the
company while Roche is getting hit on underwhelming data. The EUR isn’t doing a whole
lot.
  * Asia – the major indices in Asia saw mixed price action overnight: Japan (TPX -0.84%, NKY -
0.95%), HK (Hang Seng +0.52%, HSCEI +0.09%), mainland China (SHCOMP +0.34%, Shenzhen
+0.55%, CSI 300 +0.7%), Taiwan (TAIEX -0.2%), Australia (ASX 200 -1.52%), and India (down
~35-40bp). South Korea was closed. There weren’t too many major headlines out of the
region. In Japan all the major sub-groups saw pressure; healthcare, telecoms, utilities, and
industrials fell the most. Toshiba rallied after media reports pointed (again) to a potential
AVGO bid for the memory unit. HK/China outperformed the rest of Asia; within the Hang
Seng top groups included real estate, tech, and industrials while discretionary, energy, and
staples lagged.

#Top Headlines for Tuesday

  * Economic data/monetary policy headlines for Tues 6/6. It was generally a slow morning.
Eurozone retail sales came in a touch light for Apr at +0.1% M/M vs. the St +0.2%. The RBA
left rates unchanged, as expected (http://bit.ly/2r0MBZS). JPMorgan is trimming Q1
Australian GDP estimates following weak net trade and gov’t spending data
(http://bit.ly/2qSDYkS). Japanese Apr wage inflation data points to some firming
(http://bit.ly/2rZw7pX).
  * Washington update – all the media wants to talk about is Russia/Comey, all Emperor Coffeve wants to
talk about (for this week) is infrastructure, and the market couldn’t care less about either
issue. Political expectations have been subdued for weeks and this is helping insulate stocks
from all the Washington-linked noise. Curiosity and a relatively barren calendar will have
eyes glued to Comey on Thurs but this isn’t likely to be a market-moving event. Meanwhile
all the infrastructure-related noise is considered by most to be just that (empty rhetoric w/o
a chance of passing into law) and actually could be counterproductive (to the extent it
places yet another burden on Congress at a time when its agenda is already very full). From
the perspective of the SPX the focus right now is on the debt ceiling, the F18 budget, and
Emperor Coffeve’s Fed nominees. Investors are reasonable confident in Washington avoiding a debt
 ceiling debacle and shutdown (although the latter issue may require a few CRs before a final
agreement is reached). Taxes are still important but at this point simply getting the
corporate rate and repatriation rate to <28% and 8-10%, respectively, by the end of CQ1:18
would be considered a victory.
   * Emperor Coffeve to meet w/Congressional GOP leaders on Tues 6/6 in a bid to jumpstart his
agenda; White House wants healthcare vote this summer, tax reform in fall –
Reuters http://reut.rs/2rwmoWP
   * Republicans increasingly concerned that Emperor Coffeve’s behavior (and tweeting) is
increasingly placing their agenda in peril – Washington Post.
http://wapo.st/2rORPfF
   * Taxes - House Republican leaders’ controversial border adjustment tax is dead, and
as a result, their plans to dramatically overhaul the tax code could soon be too – Roll
Call http://bit.ly/2rwgsgr
   * Healthcare – Senate Republicans are pushing forward on healthcare w/the
leadership keen to have a vote by the Jul 4 recess even if the measure doesn’t have
enough support to pass. Senate Republicans will meet Tues to discuss the issue.
McConnell doesn’t want healthcare dominating the rest of the year and thinks a
vote soon will help provide clarity (either enough support exists or it doesn’t and
the GOP moves on to other items). At this point it doesn’t look like 50 votes exist.
Politico. http://politi.co/2rYgQ90
   * Emperor Coffeve turns on his AG – Emperor Coffeve is said to be souring on AG Sessions, upset over the
stalled travel ban and particularly incensed about Sessions having recused himself
from the various Russia probes. Emperor Coffeve doesn’t think a special counsel would have
been appointed if Sessions hadn’t recused himself. NYT. http://nyti.ms/2sMkb7m
   * Emperor Coffeve to launch new America-themed hotel chain – the Emperor Coffeve Organization will
launch a new lower-end hotel chain dubbed “American Idea” that it hopes will
appeal to budget-conscious patriots; the first locations will open in little-known
towns in Mississippi (a state that went for Emperor Coffeve by 18 points over Clinton) and
should come online quickly as the initiative will involve rebranding existing Holiday
Inns and Comfort Inns – NYT http://nyti.ms/2ruCUGG
  * Economic conditions aren’t very different from 2016 (when the Fed kept policy on hold for
most of the year) but financial conditions are much healthier today and that is giving the
FOMC comfort to proceed w/additional hiking – FT http://on.ft.com/2rN84cR
  * US and Mexico close to a sugar deal – Wilbur Ross said the two countries are nearing an
agreement around sugar; the Mon deadline has been pushed back 24 hours to allow for
additional negotiations. WSJ. http://on.wsj.com/2sx7Ep9
  * Oil output set to rise in 2018 regardless of the OPEC/Russia agreement (and there are
some compliance concerns w/regards to that pact). Marketwatch has a cautious oil article
noting that output looks set to rise despite the recent Russia/OPEC agreement. Meanwhile
there are signs that compliance w/the pact could be weakening at the margin.
http://on.mktw.net/2rXMXFU
  * Qatar – Kuwait is mediating the recent rift between Qatar and some of its Middle Eastern
neighbors; Qatar hopes Kuwait will be able to reduce some of the friction – Reuters
http://reut.rs/2rZ4PA0
  * Qatar – the $1B ransom payment to al Qaeda affiliates and Iran was “the straw that broke
the camel’s back” – a group of Qatari royals were kidnapped in Iraq while on a hunting trip
and the gov’t paid $1B in ransom to get them back. That payment, to groups affiliated
w/terrorist organizations and the Iran, caused Qatar’s Gulf neighbors (and Egypt) to sever
diplomatic ties. FT http://on.ft.com/2qUXTnA
  * China/climate change – China is looking to capitalize on its lead in solar and wind energy as
the Emperor Coffeve administration ostensibly deemphasizes renewables; Beijing wants to help other
countries meet their climate goals – NYT http://nyti.ms/2sN3PLH
  * Active managers are beginning to beat the market (although not in a particularly
encouraging fashion) – the WSJ notes that active performance has improved of late
although this seems to simply be a function of managers overweighting a handful of
momentum stocks. WSJ http://on.wsj.com/2sxfSNT
   

#Company-specific news update for Mon night. 

 
 * In general it was a slow night of headlines although a few items were in focus. J. Crew announced a mgmt. transition that will see Mickey Drexler give up his CEO role to West Elm’s James Brett (Drexler will remain
chairman); http://on.wsj.com/2rMrK0z. PRGO also said its CEO will be stepping down (the
co has created a search committee to find a successor). MCHP raised its June Q guidance;
the co now sees revs at the mid-point of the range rising 5.25% Q/Q (vs. the prior mid-point
+4.5%) and EPS will come in 1.22-1.26 (vs. the prior 1.17-1.27); http://bit.ly/2rMXRgO. CASY
shares slumped in after-hours trading after earnings came in light of expectations while THO
rallied on back of better results. RAD put out an update on the WBA deal, stating that the
FTC’s longer than expected review of the merger has left a negative impact on the
company’s results. SIG shares fell after the close after announcing the departure of its COO
for violations of company policy “unrelated to financial matters”. CSX’s CEO reassured
shareholders during the co’s shareholder meeting on Mon that he would be able to lead the
turnaround despite requiring supplemental oxygen for an undisclosed medical condition
(http://on.wsj.com/2sKPjUR). Sony made pos. comments on PS4 sales and says robust
Nintendo Switch trends aren’t subtracting from PlayStation’s momentum
(http://on.ft.com/2qURKYt). According to Bloomberg, Sprint/S and TMUS are considering
an all-stock option as they proceed w/merger talks (https://bloom.bg/2r0RwtR). WDC is
offering concessions to Toshiba in a bid to strike a semi deal and avoid the unit being sold to
a 3rd party (http://s.nikkei.com/2qUQrZz). SFR will purchase a portfolio of single family
rental homes for $815M funded by a subsequently announced equity offering.
 
 * Toshiba/AVGO – Toshiba shares rallied Tues after the Asahi newspaper reported
that it is considering giving AVGO exclusive rights to negotiate a purchase of the
memory unit. Reuters http://reut.rs/2qWyMRp
 * AMZN targets core WMT customer segment – AMZN is launching a new Prime
membership price aimed at lower-income Americans receiving government
assistance (the new rate is $5.99/month). WMT captured ~18% of all money spent
through the SNAP program last year (about ~$13B in revs) and AMZN is attacking
that market. WSJ. http://on.wsj.com/2rGgNf0
 * AAPL recap – the WWDC was largely as expected and didn’t contain any surprises
(AAPL shares opened in the red on back of a d/g Mon morning and stayed at those
levels throughout the entire session – there wasn’t any major movement around
the Tim Cook keynote which started at 1pmET). The HomePod was marketed more
as a music device (i.e. a Sonos competitor) instead of a broader home assistant (it
will do all the home assisting tasks via Siri but the device contains high-end audio
specifications absent from AMZN Echo and others); the one criticism that most had
w/the product was its price ($349). The whole MacBook lineup received a refresh
(as expected). The main purpose of the WWDC are Apple’s various operation
systems and they were a central piece of the Mon keynote (some of the highlights:
Apple introduced a Venmo money transfer competitor for iOS along w/a GDOTbacked
debit card and announced that Amazon TV will be coming to tvOS).


#Calendar of events to watch for the week of Mon June 5
 
  * Calendar for Wed June 7 – the focus will be on China’s FX reserve numbers for May (Tues
night/Wed morning), German factory orders for Apr (2amET), the India RBI decision
(5amET), US consumer credit for Apr (3pmET), analyst meetings (RJF, TAP, and WCC),
earnings (BF’b pre-open and TLRD, VRNT after the close), and a slew of conferences.
  * Calendar for Thurs June 8 – the focus will be on China’s May imports/exports (Wed
night/Thurs morning), German industrial production for Apr (2amET), the UK election, the
ECB decision (7:45amET statement and 8:30amET press conf.), Comey’s testimony before
the Senate Intelligence panel, analyst meetings (AZPN and SYMC), earnings (Dell, SJM preopen
and CLDR, Hudson’s Bay, and PAY after the close), and conference presentations.
   * ECB decision – the language around growth will likely turn more sanguine and the
balance of risks could approach “balanced”. However, Draghi will likely strongly
qualify any growth optimism with ongoing inflation caution (recall the most recent
Eurozone CPI for May, out 5/31, fell short of expectations). The promise to enhance
monetary accommodation even further may be dropped although the text isn’t
likely to threaten earlier tightening. The language around asset purchases, rates,
and policy sequencing will probably stay unchanged (the market would welcome a
return of the deposit rate to 0% given the headwind this represents for banks
although the ECB will likely be averse to take this step as it could be misconstrued as
premature tightening by the market).
   * UK election - May/Tory Party poll numbers have softened over the last few weeks
and the latest readings suggest the conservatives will fall short of an outright
parliamentary majority (~305-310 for the Tories, ~260 for labor, and ~80 for other
parties).
  * Calendar for Fri June 9 – the focus will be on China’s May CPI/PPI (Thurs night/Fri morning),
German imports/exports for Apr (2amET), and the US wholesale inventories/trade
numbers for Apr (10amET).
Catalysts for 2017 – big events to watch for 2017 (preliminary list – additional events likely to be

http://reut.rs/2rwmoWP
  * Infrastructure spending was supposed to be a “unicorn”, the one issue capable of
transcending party lines and mustering enough support to get to Emperor Coffeve’s desk. However,
lately infrastructure is looking like just another horse w/both sides far apart on specifics.
Washington Post. http://wapo.st/2qZsyLw

result, their plans to dramatically overhaul the tax code could soon be too – Roll Call

classified NSA documents detailing Russian hacking into the US election; the document leak
occurred Monday – Politico http://politi.co/2qZNeTJ
  * Emperor Coffeve turns on his AG – Emperor Coffeve is said to be souring on AG Sessions, upset over the stalled
travel ban and particularly incensed about Sessions having recused himself from the various
Russia probes. Emperor Coffeve doesn’t think a special counsel would have been appointed if Sessions
hadn’t recused himself. NYT. http://nyti.ms/2sMkb7m
  * Emperor Coffeve’s tweets undermine his immigrant/travel ban – Emperor Coffeve tweeted about his blocked

  * Healthcare – Senate Republicans are pushing forward on healthcare w/the leadership keen
to have a vote by the Jul 4 recess even if the measure doesn’t have enough support to pass.
Senate Republicans will meet Tues to discuss the issue. McConnell doesn’t want healthcare
dominating the rest of the year and thinks a vote soon will help provide clarity (either
enough support exists or it doesn’t and the GOP moves on to other items). At this point it
doesn’t look like 50 votes exist. Politico. http://politi.co/2rYgQ90
  * Bank regulations – Emperor Coffeve will nominate Joseph Otting to run the OCC (comptroller of the

initiative will involve rebranding existing Holiday Inns and Comfort Inns – NYT

#US – economic growth, monetary policy

the camel’s back” – a group of Qatari royals were kidnapped in Iraq while on a hunting trip

w/terrorist organizations and the Iran, caused Qatar’s Gulf neighbors (and Egypt) to sever
diplomatic ties. FT http://on.ft.com/2qUXTnA

#[Today's Top Headlines for Monday, April 6th, 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/06/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-monday.html)

*****

> * Dow futures pointed to an over 800-point gain at Monday’s open as improved coronavirus data in Europe offered hope for the United States. Hints that Saudi Arabia and Russia might be close to an oil production cut deal are also helping stocks. On Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 360 points, capping its third negative week in four and pushing blue chips down 28.8% from their February all-time highs. The prior week, March 23-March 27, saw the best weekly gain for the Dow since 1938. On Monday, JPMorgan Chase Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon, who is recovering from heart surgery, released his widely read annual letter. “We have the resources to emerge from this crisis as a stronger country,” Dimon wrote.

*****

> * The price of West Texas Intermediate crude was down about 2% early Monday, well off session lows of 9%. Kirill Dmitriev, CEO of Russia’s sovereign wealth fund RDIF, told CNBC overnight that Moscow and Riyadh were “very close” to an output reduction deal. WTI, which surged nearly 32% last week on signs of a possible Saudi-Russian agreement, remained more than 50% off its recent 52-week high in April 2019. On Sunday, President Donald Trump reiterated his threat to impose “very substantial” tariffs on oil imports. But he said he does not believe he’ll need to do so.

*****

> * Heading into what the Trump administration has characterized as the toughest week yet in the fight against the coronavirus, U.S. cases surged to over 330,000, the most of any country in the world — in fact, nearly as many as the next three countries — Italy, Spain and Germany — combined, according to Johns Hopkins University data. There have been 9,653 deaths in the U.S. Over a third of all infections and more than 40% of the deaths in America are in New York state, with New York City shouldering most of that burden. Over the weekend, Trump said 1,000 medical military personnel are deploying to New York City to help treat the overwhelming crush of coronavirus patients. Trump also expressed hope that U.S. cases may flatten soon.

*****

> * Global coronavirus cases increased to nearly 1.3 million with 70,355 deaths and almost 250,000 recoveries. While U.S. cases and deaths have yet to slow, Europe’s hot spots are seeing signs of possibly leveling off, with Spain, Italy, Germany and France seeing death rates and new infections slowing down. Italy still has the most deaths in the world with 15,887, followed by Spain’s 13,055 fatalities. U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, 55, was hospitalized for tests Sunday, 10 days after contracting the coronavirus. Since Beijing first reported the outbreak in late December, The New York Times said at least 430,000 people have arrived in the U.S. on direct flights from China.

*****

> * Apple is designing and producing face shields for medical workers, CEO Tim Cook said in a video released Sunday. Apple is aiming to produce 1 million face shields per week. Doctors across the country have said that a shortage of personal protective equipment, like face shields and masks, puts them at risk during the COVID-19 outbreak. Cook also said Apple has donated 20 million N95 masks to organizations that need them.

* **Historical Move v Implied Move:** We determine the historical volatility (log variance of daily gains) of the underlying asset and compare that to the current implied volatitlity (IV) of the option price. This is used to determine the Call or Put Premium associated with the pricing of options (implied volatility).
* **Priced Move:** given the current option prices, how much in dollar amounts will the underlying have to move to make the call/put break even. This is how much vol the option is pricing in. The expected move.
* **Expiration:** 2023-05-12.
* **Call/Put Premium:** How much extra you are paying for the implied move relative to the historic move. Low numbers mean options are ""cheaper."" High numbers mean options are ""expensive.""
* **Efficiency:** This factor represents the bid/ask spreads and the depth of the order book relative to the price of the option. It represents how much traders will pay in slippage with a round trip trade. Lower numbers are less efficient than higher numbers.
* **E.R.:** Days unitl the next Earnings Release. This feature is still in beta as we work on a more complete list of earnings dates.
* **Why isn't my stock on this list?** It doesn't have ""weeklies"", the underlying is ""too cheap"", or the options markets are too illiquid (open interest) to qualify for this strategy. 480 underlyings are used in this report and only the top results end up passing the criteria for each filter."

#Trading Update

* What’s happening this morning? It was another slow evening of news other than the
German Aug factory order numbers (which were very strong although the euro and
Eurozone stocks are both in the red), a few US earnings reports (COST and YUMC), andsome M&A (GIMO, HON, JWN, PENN/PNK, SNCR, and more). The overall macro narrativeremains the same as it was at the Thurs close (see below for an update on the macro narrative as well as potential upcoming risks). The major Asian indices generally saw gains –
TPX +0.28%, NKY +0.3%, Hang Seng +0.28%, HSCEI +0.54%, Taiwan +0.14%, Australia
+1.04%, and India +0.5-7% (mainland China and Korea were both closed). There weren’t
any huge themes in Asia although Macau casino stocks were weak in HK on back of
underwhelming Golden Week visitor numbers (autos and financials led HK on the upside).
Australia’s 1% rally was led by banks, miners, and telecoms. The major Eurozone indices
are trading off small (~10-20bp); autos are outperforming while banks, retail, energy, and
utilities lag. The GBP is extending its losses from Thurs amid more uncertainty around UK
PM May (the DXY spiked ~50bp Thurs and is up small so far Fri morning). US S&P futures
are trading down 1-2 points.
* Calendar for Fri 10/6 – the focus will be on the US jobs report for Sept (8:30amET), US
wholesale inventories/trade sales for Aug (10amET), US consumer credit for Aug (3pmET),
and Fed speakers (Kaplan 8:30amET on CNBC, Bostic 9:15amET, Dudley 12:15pmET, Kaplan
12:45pmET, and Bullard 1pmET).
o US jobs preview – there is very little anticipation or focus on the Sept jobs report
(Fri morning 8/6 8:30amET) as 1) most are anticipating large storm-related
distortions and 2) at this point in the cycle it only requires ~75K monthly adds to
keep the UR steady (as was discussed in this JPMorgan report http://bit.ly/2fbT6cE).
The St is in print at +80K for adds (vs. ADP for Sept at +135K and Aug BLS +156K)
w/a 4.4% UR (unchanged w/Aug) and wages +0.3% M/M and +2.5% Y/Y (vs. Aug
+0.1% M/M and +2.5% Y/Y). It’s very difficult to see the Sept BLS report changing
the near-term US monetary policy trajectory (w/ongoing normalization and a FF
hike on 12/13). The potential for a hike on 11/1 is very low and if anything the
Sept CPI on Fri 10/13 may be a more important data point than jobs on Fri 10/6.
Instead, the bigger Fed uncertainty has nothing to do w/data or policy but instead
concerns staffing (i.e. who will be the next chair? A Trump announcement could
come as soon as next week – Powell and Warsh are the frontrunners according to
media reports w/the former appearing to have a slight edge).

#Top Headlines for Friday

* Eco data recap for Fri morning 10/6 – the big data came out of Germany where factory
orders for Aug beat expectations by a wide margin (orders +3.6% M/M vs. the St +0.7% and
+7.8% Y/Y vs. the St +4.7%). See JPMorgan’s comments on the German data
(http://bit.ly/2y42sh4). Japan’s wage inflation figures for Aug were soft, as expected
(http://bit.ly/2kuygr0).
o Fed chair – markets would be comfortable w/any of the main candidates (including
Powell, Warsh, Cohn, Yellen, etc.) w/the exception of one person: John Taylor.
Bloomberg.
o Fed update – Kansas City Fed President George spoke Thurs night and said the US
economy needed further rates hikes (http://cnb.cx/2kqTiqj). JPMorgan’s Mike
Feroli published an updated FOMC hawk/dove chart following the confirmation of
Quarles (http://bit.ly/2z1jSti).
o Japan’s “Party of Hope” unveils an economic agenda that pledges to rely less on
aggressive fiscal and monetary stimulus – Reuters http://reut.rs/2ghahXu
o AUD hit as RBA’s Harper doesn’t rule out a rate cut in a WSJ article.

* UK PM May the subject of more speculation amid disclosure of plot to topple her; former
party chairman, Grant Shapps, said May’s leadership should now be challenged. Reuters

* Spain/Catalonia – Spain’s Constitutional Court ordered the suspension of the Catalan
parliament’s regional session scheduled for Mon; Catalonia had planned on declaring
independence at the session. Reuters http://reut.rs/2xlDfjC
o Spain’s gov’t will change rules and make it easier for firms to move their legal base
out of Catalonia – Reuters http://reut.rs/2z1WQCF
* Tax update - there is a lot of focus on taxes in the US as the Senate Budget Committee
(right at the Thurs close) and the full House (at ~1pmET Thurs afternoon) advance budget
resolutions (the full Senate will presumably vote within the next two weeks). This is a
necessary step in the tax process (as these resolutions contain the reconciliation
instructions allowing tax to pass via a simple majority in the Senate) but also a relatively minor one. Far more complicated will be agreeing on rates, deduction schedules, deficits,
etc., and if anything all the press in the last few days and weeks point to divisions within
the GOP on these matters being larger than anticipated.
o Schumer warns that the proposal to eliminate the SALT deduction will kill the GOP
tax plan – Bloomberg. https://bloom.bg/2xXX8KL
o GOP desire to repeal the estate tax runs into resistance - from Republicans. As a
result this piece of the 9/27 tax blueprint (among others) may wind up being
scrapped - WSJ. http://on.wsj.com/2gf9G8E
o Fed officials express concern over tax plans – Fed officials warned the tax plan may
only provide a temporary boost to growth while fueling inflation and driving debt to
unsustainable levels – Reuters http://reut.rs/2xWMrdG
* Republican headaches keep growing as donors withhold money, a tax consensus fails to
materialize, and “establishment” figures depart the scene (Strange losing to Moore, Corker
retiring, etc.). Republican leaders are increasingly concerned about the party’s grip on the
House and Senate should it fail to pass a tax bill. Leaders “fear that the inchoate populism
that Mr. Trump personifies, and which Mr. Bannon is attempting to weaponize against
incumbents, is on the march” – NYT http://nyti.ms/2y3lUKT
* Trump looks to jolt NAFTA – the White House is considering a proposal that would
represent a radical shift to the principles underlying NAFTA. According to rule changes
being considered, automobiles would need to have a specific level of US-made content in
order to qualify for tariff breaks (right now autos only need to have a specific level of
content from within the NAFTA region). WSJ. http://on.wsj.com/2y4LXlo
* Trump makes cryptic comment ahead of a dinner with US military leaders. Trump said the
dinner might represent “the calm before the storm”. Asked repeatedly by reporters to
clarify his comments, Trump said, “You’ll find out” – Bloomberg https://bloom.bg/2xXI2r6
* Trump was “furious” over NBC’s Tillerson “moron” article; John Kelly was forced to
rearrange his schedule and stayed in Washington in order to try and calm tensions – NBC.
http://nbcnews.to/2fOGx3B
* Iran/Trump – Trump will “decertify” the Iran nuclear accord next week (speech on 10/12)
and declare the agreement as not being in the US national interest according to the
Washington Post (article out at ~2:40pmET Thurs afternoon). This is consistent w/what the
AP and Politico reported earlier in the week. Note that Trump’s 10/12 declarations won’t
end the Iranian nuclear pact as it will be up to Congress whether re-impose sanctions on
Tehran (and Trump will hold off on recommending such a step). Washington Post

* North Korea – US lawmakers are pressuring the Trump White House to toughen sanctions
against North Korea – WSJ. http://on.wsj.com/2xlKdVQ
* The Economist's lead article this week speaks to sentiment at the moment and this is one of
the big reasons why stocks are proving to be so resilient. ""Asset prices are high across the
board. Is it time to worry?"" (http://econ.st/2xVXOjv).
o The WSJ notes that a key European junk-bond index is now yielding less than 10yr
US TSYs although it offers a reasonable explanation for this ostensibly irrational
price level – WSJ. http://on.wsj.com/2xkwYVb
* Company-specific news update from Thurs night. There were a few earnings reports out
Thurs AMC but for the most part it was another slow evening. COST EPS beats thanks to
better SG&A and favorable tax while GMs were light; Sept same-store-sales beat w/upside
in the US (the stock ended down 3% during the Thurs after-hours trading session). YUMC’s
results came in ahead of expectations (EPS/same-store-sales) and it increased capital return.
SNCR reentered M&A talks w/Siris Capital (Siris is looking to buy SNCR’s Intralinks and may
take a ~20% equity stake in SNCR); SNCR ended up ~27% during the Thurs after-hours
trading session. According to the WSJ, HON is pursuing an acquisition of Evoqua Water Tech
in a deal that could be worth $3B (http://on.wsj.com/2yseCSp). The WSJ reported (during
trading on Thurs http://on.wsj.com/2xjE24p) on merger talks between PENN and PNK (the
firms have been unable to agree to terms but PENN is still interested in buying PNK).
* JWN buyout not completely dead – the Nordstrom family is exploring a new deal structure
w/Leonard Green that would involve less debt. The family is trying to raise more equity
(although it isn’t clear where the money will come from). WSJ. http://on.wsj.com/2ggTvbh
* GIMO – Elliot’s takeover talks w/the company have ground to a halt according to Reuters
over price disagreements – Reuters http://reut.rs/2fNCepo
* SUM, ASHG – SUM has made a rival bid for ASHG as it looks to scuttle the existing Ash
Grove-CRH PLC transaction. Ash Grove’s board said the offer could result in a superior
proposal and that it would engage in talks with the third party. Bloomberg.
* AMZN: the one market where Amazon is failing to dominate: Hollywood. The WSJ
discusses AMZN’s failure to become a force in content. WSJ. http://on.wsj.com/2xZcJtr
* Macau casino stocks slump during Fri trading as Golden Week visitor numbers disappoint
expectations – Bloomberg https://bloom.bg/2fOuGmd

#Identifying risks – what could go wrong?

* Reflation enthusiasm is undercut by less aggressive CB normalization, dramatic curve
flattening, and/or a softening in nominal growth. Of all the reflation pieces (monetary policy
normalization, expansionary fiscal policy, firming inflation, and ongoing real growth
strength), the last piece (real growth) is increasingly being taken for granted.
* Bank investors wind up focusing too much on reflation/yields (which are tailwinds) but miss
weakening credit (higher provisions) and tepid loan growth.
* The first speech by the next Fed chair unsettles sentiment (assuming the chair isn’t Yellen).
* The tax process slows in Washington as Republicans prove incapable of reaching a
consensus on rates, deductions, and deficits.
* Paul Ryan decides to “pull a Boehner”, stepping down as Speaker out of frustration with his
inability to pass legislation.
* The final tax bill results in materially higher rates for upper-income Americans.
* May winds up stepping down as UK PM, sowing ongoing Brexit uncertainty.
* Abe does much worse than anticipated during the upcoming Japan election (10/22).
* North Korea conducts an above-ground nuclear bomb test (or even worse, an atmospheric
test).
* Iran decides to resume its nuclear weapons program, sparking an immediate escalation of
Middle East geopolitical tensions (Trump’s Iran speech is coming up on 10/12).
* Washington introduces (or threatens to introduce) tough new regulations aimed at
internet/social media companies following the Russia election investigations (note that US
internet giants will be testifying before Congress on 11/1).
* Prominent members of the Trump team decide to leave the gov’t (the market would be
particularly sensitive to Tillerson, Mattis, Kelly, and/or Cohn departing; recent media reports
suggest the Tillerson-Trump relationship is particularly strained).

#Macro Update

* The pro-reflation bias commenced back on 9/11 and has been propelled ever since by
ongoing real growth strength, firming inflation, normalizing monetary policy/rhetoric, and
expansionary fiscal policy (in particular in the US w/the 9/27 tax blueprint but also in
Germany following that country’s election outcome and fin min change).
* This enthusiasm can extend for a few more weeks but the ECB/BOE decisions (on 10/26
and 11/2, respectively) will mark the culmination of a series of pro-reflation
catalysts/developments and thus the trade may enter a period of extended consolidation
around those central bank events.
* Meanwhile the nuances of this present reflation process aren’t being appreciated –
growth and corporate earnings are late-cycle (not early), multiples are already rich
(although not necessarily ridiculous), inflation is only very gradually firming to target, the
economy faces enormous structural headwinds in the form of labor supply and productivity
growth, and while central banks are normalizing policy will stay extremely accommodative
for years to come (the structural headwinds and slow tightening pace will prevent yields
from materially rising and curves from significantly steepening).
* The tenor of sentiment is beginning to evolve and there is definitely greater frustration
w/people being forced to participate in a tape many don’t particularly love at present
levels – this helps fuel runs such has occurred over the last few weeks (the SPX hasn’t closed
in the red since Mon 9/25) but it also makes for a precarious setup w/a lot of weak
“renters” who will be quick to sell the minute momentum pauses.
* Bottom Line: the lack of major catalysts is helping the rally propagate and the calendar is
relatively clear until earnings (which kick off w/banks on Thurs 10/12). The reflation
impetus will likely stay in place into the ECB/BOE (10/26 and 11/2, respectively) after which
a consolidation (at least) is likely (note that a lot of the “easy” tax steps are occurring now
– the blueprint on 9/27, the budget resolutions, etc. However, reaching a consensus on
rates, deductions, and deficits will be extremely difficult and this will become more
apparent later in Oct and into Nov, around the same time as the ECB/BOE decisions).

#Calendar of events to watch for the week of Mon Oct 9

* Calendar for the week of 10/9 – overall it should be a relatively slow week although a few
items are in focus. The current reflation emphasis makes the US CPI on Fri 10/13 prob. the
single most important eco data point of the week but there are other numbers in focus
(German trade/IP for Aug and China imports/exports for Sept). The CQ3 earnings season
kicks off in earnest with the banks on Thurs and Friday. Away from scheduled events, media
reports suggest Catalonia could formally declare independence on Mon (although this could
easily be delayed following court challenges and as the region’s leaders seek a settlement
w/Madrid) while the White House may unveil its infrastructure spending blueprint during
the week of 10/9 (http://bit.ly/2wwiop9). South Korean security officials have warned that
North Korea may fire additional missiles between 10/10 and 10/18 while Trump’s Fed chair
selection could come soon (media reports suggest Powell and Warsh are the two
frontrunners). Trump is expected to deliver an Iranian policy speech on/around Thurs
10/12 during which he will declare the nuclear deal as no longer being in the US national
interest. HON has said it will announce its formal portfolio review decision prior to earnings
(media reports, including on CNBC, suggest it will retain its aerospace unit).
* Calendar for Mon 10/9 – the day should be pretty quiet owing to the US Columbus Day
holiday (equities will be open but fixed income is closed). The focus will be on the China FX
reserve numbers for Sept (Fri night/Sat morning 10/7), the China Caixin services PMI for
Sept (Sun night/Mon morning), Germany’s industrial production for Aug (2amET), and
earnings (LVMH reports results after the European close).
* Calendar for Tues 10/10 – the focus will be on the German trade figures for Aug (2amET), a
bunch of analyst meetings (including TECD, Santander, WDAY, and WMT), the PG
shareholder meeting (at which the Trian/Peltz board seat request will be voted on), and
earnings (CUDA after the close).
* Calendar for Wed 10/11 – the focus will be on the US JOLTs report for Aug (10amET), Fed
minutes from the 9/20 meeting (2pmET), analyst meetings (KR), and earnings (DAL, BLK,
FAST, and OZRK before the open).
 
* Calendar for Thurs 10/12 – the focus will be on Eurozone IP for Aug (5amET), the US PPI for
Sept (8:30amET), Trump’s Iran speech, analyst meetings (BOX, HPQ, LSCC, and WDC), and
earnings (C, DPZ, JPM, LNN, Sky PLC, and Tata Consultancy pre-open).
* Calendar for Fri 10/13 – the focus will be on China’s imports/exports for Sept (Thurs
night/Fri morning), the US CPI for Sept (8:30amET), US retail sales for Sept (8:30amET), the
Michigan Confidence numbers for Oct (10amET), US business inventories for Aug (10amET),
analyst meetings (SAFM), and earnings (BAC, DRFG, FHN, FRC, JBHT, Man Group, PNC, and
WFC pre-open).

#Catalysts – big events to watch over the coming months

> Stocks exit 2020 with strong gains and are riding a tailwind, but already in the dawn of the new year, the market could face its first big challenge.
*****
> The final outcome of the 2020 election plays out Tuesday, when voters in Georgia will pick their senators and decide which party controls the U.S. Senate.
*****
> With President-elect Joe Biden heading to the White House and a Democratic-controlled House of Representatives, Wall Street has been comfortable with the view that Biden and the Democrats could not succeed with tax hikes and more progressive policy changes while Republicans hold the Senate.
*****
> The runoff election for the two Senate seats Tuesday is widely expected to result in one or both of the incumbent Republican senators retaining their seats. But Democrats are close in the polls and should they win, each party would have 50 seats with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris the tie breaker.
*****
> “Georgia is the most important thing to the Biden presidency for the next two years,” said Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James. “It’s going to determine what is the legislative agenda and who can get confirmed by the United States Senate.”
*****
> Sen. David Perdue is being challenged by Democrat Jon Ossoff, while GOP Sen. Kelly Loeffler is running against Democrat Raphael Warnock. None of the candidates had more than 50% of the vote in the Nov. 3 election, so Georgia law requires a runoff election between the two leading candidates for each seat.
*****
> “It’s a binary event,” said Mills, adding it’s of growing interest to markets. “The general sense for the market is that Republicans are well positioned to maintain their majority in the Senate. But I think the 2020 election as well as the 2016 election and to some extent, the 2018 election has humbled us … The Senate outcomes, in particular, seem to be less predictable than almost any other elections.”
*****
> Mills said the results may take several days to determine, adding to the uncertainty the event could hold for markets. According to an RBC investor survey, 88% expect Republicans to maintain control, and most say that is a positive for the stock market.
*****
> “The market tends to shoot first and ask questions later. There will certainly be a reaction if Democrats win both those seats,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. Strategists say there could be a relief rally if Republican incumbents see a clear victory.
*****
> “That totally dominates [trading] because it’s about do we have status quo or do we have Democrats controlling all parts of Washington and what that means for spending and taxes,” Boockvar said. “I think you could see the worries about taxes overwhelming any thoughts on the benefits of more spending” by Democrats.
*****
> # By the numbers
> A year of extreme volatility ended with a big win for stocks, as the pandemic steered the course for markets. The S&P 500 was up 16.3% for the year, ending at 3,756. That gain comes after a 34% decline early in the year, followed by a powerful more-than 65% rebound. Technology was the big winner for the year, and the Nasdaq was up 43.6% at 12,888.
*****
> Besides the runoff vote, the market will be watching a stream of data in the coming week, including the important December jobs report Friday. That could show fewer than 100,000 jobs were added as the spreading virus impacted hiring and layoffs. There were 245,000 jobs created in November.
*****
> There is also ISM manufacturing data Tuesday, and a number of Fed speakers, including Vice Chairman Richard Clarida on Friday.
*****
> The virus itself could also be a factor for stocks.
*****
> Conventional wisdom for the coming year has been that vaccines will be widely distributed, and by the second half things will start to get back to normal and the economy will pick up. But the initial distribution has been slow, and far short of the 20 million targeted for December by President Donald Trump’s task force.
*****
> In that recent RBC survey, three quarters of investors were optimistic about vaccine distribution with 80% expecting a majority to be vaccinated by the end of 2021. “We suspect that the positive outlook for the stock market and the economy would deteriorate if expectations for a smooth vaccine rollout are not met,” RBC strategists wrote.
*****
> They also noted that nearly 60% of the investors surveyed believe high stock market valuations are problematic.
*****
> “This suggests to us that any threat to the economic and earnings recovery story could spark profit-taking. On this point, it is worth noting that the vaccine was the No. 1 issue keeping investors up at night, closely followed by monetary policy and excessive optimism on the recovery,” the strategists noted.
*****
> Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank, said investors will also be watching the formal acceptance of the Electoral College vote Wednesday. Strategists expect the vote count to confirm Biden’s presidency.
*****
> However, Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley says he will challenge the certification, and several House Republicans have already vowed to contest the election at that time. If one House member and a senator jointly object to a state’s slate of electors, the two houses of Congress must separately debate and vote on the objection.
*****
> Strategists see little chance of any impact on the election outcome, but there could be fireworks. Trump has been claiming since the election that there was fraud but multiple courts failed to find any truth to the claims.
*****
> Rupkey said investors are not taking into account enough potential for political risk from the deep animosity between the two political parties.
*****
> “I think the additional stimulus and hopes for additional stimulus, and infrastructure spending in 2021, I don’t know that that is such a slam dunk, because of the issue of political instability,” he said.

> # Why A Year-End Rally Bodes Well For 2021

> Welcome to the last day of 2020! It has been a devastating year in so many ways, yet for investors it has been quite rewarding. Much of the gains in 2020 have taken place the final two months, with the S&P 500 Index up more than 14% in November and December so far, the best end to a year since WWII.

> A big end of year rally could have bulls smiling in 2021. “Turns out a 10% or more gain the final two months of the year has equaled a higher S&P 500 the following year every single time since World War II,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “In fact, January was also higher every single time as well, so maybe this strong rally to end the year is a clue for higher prices into next year.”

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&P 500 gained an average of more than 18% the year following a 10% or more surge during the final two months of the year. Meanwhile, January was up 5 for 5 as well, rising an impressive 3% on average.

> Here’s what the average year looks like after the prior year gains 10% or more the final two months compared to a typical year. Once again, strong returns are the playbook historically.

> # Fifty to Zero in 283 Days

> In a year with some pretty crazy charts, the one below is right up there with some of the best. After all the markets have been through this year, bot the S&P 500 and Long-Term Treasuries have seen nearly identical returns on a total return basis. That's right, with just a few hours left in the trading year, the S&P 500's total return in 2020 has been a gain of 17.6%, while Long Term US Treasuries, as measured by the B of A Merrill Lynch Long-Term Treasury Index has rallied 17.3%. What makes this nearly identical performance all the more incredible is that on March 23rd, the performance gap between the two was more than 50 percentage points.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123120-Stocks-Bonds.png))**

> The fact that stocks and bonds have essentially seen identical returns this year isn't typical. The chart below shows the annual performance spread between the S&P 500 and long-term US Treasuries going back to 1978. During that time, the S&P 500 has historically outperformed long-term US Treasuries by an average of 3.9 percentage points per year, but the average gap in performance between the two has been over 15 percentage points. In the 43 years since 1978, there have only been seven other years where the performance spread between the two asset classes was less than five percentage points and just two years (1985 and 1992) where the performance spread was less than a percentage point.

> # Back-to-Back Big Years for Technology

> With just two trading days (including today) left in 2020, the S&P 500 Technology sector is on pace for its second year in a row of rallying more than 40%. Going back to 1990, the only time the Technology sector experienced back-to-back returns of more than 40% was in 1998 and 1999. Back then, not only was the Technology sector up 40%+ in back-to-back years, but it was also up over 75% in both of those years. If you think markets are pretty crazy these days, they still have nothing on the last two years of the 1990s!

> In terms of cumulative returns, the Technology sector is up 210% since the last trading day of 2018, whereas in 1999 it was up 317% in a two-year span. What's also interesting to note about the last 31 years of returns for the Technology sector is how it has only experienced five down years, while the S&P 500 has been down in ten different years during that span. Furthermore, since 2009 there has only been one down year and the decline was a paltry 1.6%. Not a bad 12-year run!

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Technology-Sector-Performance.png))**

> Given that the sector has more than doubled in the last two years, there have been some big individual winners. Topping the list with a gain of just under 400% is Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). On the last day of 2018, AMD traded hands for under $20 per share. Today's it's over $90. AMD has a lead of more than 100 percentage points over the next closest stock - NVIDIA (NVDA) - which is up 288%. Interestingly, there aren't a lot of major outliers to the upside compared to the sector's 210% gain, but that's because Apple (AAPL), the sector's largest stock, has paced the sector's gains by rallying more than 240%.

> On the downside, just four stocks in the Technology sector have declined in the last two years. The worst of these has been DXC Technology (DXC) which has lost more than half of its value, while Juniper (JNPR) and HP Enterprise (HPE) are down between 10% and 20%. Lastly, FLIR Systems (FLIR) has declined less than 2%, so depending on how it acts in the next two days, it could move into positive territory just as Intel (INTC) did yesterday after Third Point bailed it out and moved the stock barely into positive territory for the last two years.

> # Growth Dragging on Small Caps

> In the past couple of weeks, we have frequently been keeping tabs on small-cap equities which have been particularly strong performers of late resulting in very overbought readings as well as extended valuations. More specifically, taking a look at growth-oriented small-caps, with only a couple days left in the year small-cap growth stocks—proxied by the Russell 2000 Growth ETF (IWO)—are on pace to have outperformed large-cap equivalents in 2020. On December 10th, IWO surpassed the S&P 500 Growth ETF (IVW) in terms of YTD performance, and even after pulling back in the past week, IWO is still in the lead.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large1.png))**

> As a result of recent moves, there has been a sharp reversal on a relative basis between the two ETFs in the past week. In the chart below, we show the ratio of the Russell 2000 Growth ETF (IWO) versus the S&P 500 Growth ETF (IVW). This ratio took off beginning in the early fall meaning small-cap growth drastically outperformed large-cap growth. But the former's weakness in the past several days has put a halt to that move.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large2.png))**

> As to just how sharp of a reversal this was, in the five days through yesterday's close, the decline in the ratio of IWO to IVW was the largest since June. Before that, April and March saw declines that were even larger. Not only was this one of the biggest drops in the relative performance of small-cap growth to large-cap growth in the past few months, but that also stands in the bottom 0.5% of all readings going back to 2000 when the ETF first began trading. Outside of this past spring, the only other periods that have also experienced this type of underperformance of small-cap growth relative to large-cap growth was at various points in 2011, 2008, and a handful of times in the early 2000s.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large3.png))**

> Small-cap underperformance has not necessarily been broad though. For value stocks, small caps (IWN) have generally outperformed large caps (IVE) for the entirety of the new bull market. While there was a bit of a turn lower in recent days, it has been nowhere close to as dramatic of a move as growth stocks.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large4.png))**

> In the charts below, we show average performance over the past week of Russell 2000 stocks broken into deciles based on their price to sales and price to book ratios. As shown, the most aggressively valued deciles have averaged the worst performance in the past week. Stocks with low P/S and P/B ratios have not been immune from the weakness, but they have held up significantly better.

# **Coronavirus fears spoiled a solid earnings season and will further dominate markets ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/21/coronavirus-fears-ruin-solid-earnings-season-and-cloud-growth-picture.html)**
*****
> The coronavirus outbreak ruined for investors what was a solid earnings reporting season and is casting a pall on forecasts for this quarter and the rest of this year. And now with most of the earnings season in the books, look for the latest coronavirus headlines to fill the vacuum and weigh on stocks the rest of the month.
*****
> Fourth-quarter profit growth for S&P 500 companies came in at 3.1%, and if the energy sector is excluded, the growth rate was 6.0%, according to Refinitiv. Just about four weeks ago, analysts expected a slight decline.
*****
> However, the deluge of solid corporate results was largely overlooked by investors who are focusing on the spillover impact from the coronavirus on U.S. corporations. Stocks post losses this week as a jump in confirmed coronavirus cases and deaths deepened concerns about slowing global economic growth. Major U.S. companies including Apple, Coca-Cola and Procter & Gamble have sounded alarms on the disease, warning of a dent in profits down the road.
*****
> “The virus is totally underrated,” CNBC’s Jim Cramer said on Friday.“What I think is a little too premature is they all presume that it is going to be solved within a foreseeable time frame. At what point do we say that many, many companies are going to be hurt by the virus [and] we’re paying too much for stocks.”
*****
> # ‘More cautious than usual’
> Wall Street analysts have been quick to slash their earnings expectations for the next quarter in light of the fast-spreading virus. Expectations for earnings growth in the first quarter have been cut in half to just 3.2% from more than 6% at the start of 2020, according to Refinitiv.
*****
> Companies themselves are also lowering guidance for earnings growth in the near future. There have been more U.S. companies issuing below-consensus guidance for the next quarter than those with upbeat forecasts, marking the weakest ratio in a February since 2014, according to Savita Subramanian, head of U.S. equity and quantitative strategy at Bank of America.
*****
> “While guidance is typically weak in the first quarter as corporates set a low bar, it has been more cautious than usual this earnings season, likely due to the coronavirus,” Subramanian said in a note.
*****
> Nearly half of the S&P 500 companies have cited coronavirus during their earnings call this season, according to FactSet. These companies’ average revenue exposure to China is 7.2%, compared to 4.8% exposure for the average S&P 500 company.
*****
> As of Friday, China’s National Health Commission reported more than 75,000 confirmed cases and over 2,000 deaths on the mainland. South Korea has also reported more than 200 cases. Meanwhile, World health officials said the outbreak in Iran is “very worrisome.”
*****
> “Lost in those headlines is corporate America’s impressive performance this earnings season,” John Lynch, LPL Financial’s chief investment strategist, said in a note. “Companies have done an admirable job growing profits considering stiff headwinds.”

# Earnings Season Observations

> The recent news that technology giant Apple would miss its fourth quarter 2020 revenue targets has understandably increased investor anxiety surrounding the potential economic impact of the coronavirus (now called COVID-19). Lost in those headlines is corporate America’s impressive performance this earnings season.

> “Companies have done an admirable job growing profits considering stiff headwinds,” said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. “Despite slowing global economic growth, weakness in capital investment and manufacturing, a strong US dollar, and a huge drop in energy sector profits, S&P 500 companies are impressively grinding out 1-2 percentage points of overall earnings growth.” The fourth quarter earnings growth may cement the third quarter of 2019 as the trough, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day below.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/corporate-america-grinding-out-small-earnings-gain-in-q4.png?ssl=1))**

> Some highlights of this earnings season:

> * **Solid revenue upside**. A solid 65% of S&P 500 Index companies have beaten revenue estimates, the highest level since second quarter 2018 and well above the long-term average at 57%. S&P 500 companies have produced a larger-than-normal nearly one percentage point positive revenue surprise and are tracking to a 3.5% top-line increase.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/revenue-tracking-nicely-ahead-of-expectations-in-q4.png?ssl=1))**

> * **Respectable earnings upside despite headwinds**. The earnings beat rate at 71% is slightly above the 10-year average (70%). S&P 500 earnings growth has surprised by a solid 4.4% so far despite economic, currency, and commodity headwinds.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/corporate-america-grinding-out-small-earnings-gain-in-q4.png?ssl=1))**

> * **Consider the energy drag**. Though 1-2% overall earnings growth isn’t much, the gain is approximately 4%, excluding the energy sector.
> * **Sector standout**. One of the most China-exposed sectors produced one of the biggest upside earnings surprises: Technology. Technology sector earnings growth is tracking to a 5% year-over-year increase, about 9 percentage points above prior estimates.
> * **Reassuring outlooks**. Estimates for S&P 500 earnings per share in 2020 have only fallen by about 0.9% since December 31, 2019. Though these numbers may come down a bit more in the coming days and the China situation remains fluid, this modest reduction reflects U.S. companies’ resilience overall amid significant supply chain disruptions.

# Election Year March: Performance Haunted By Steep 1980 Declines

> Boisterous March markets tend to drive prices up early in the month and batter stocks at month end. Julius Caesar failed to heed the famous warning to “beware the Ides of March” but investors have been served well when they have. Stock prices have a propensity to decline, sometimes rather precipitously, during the latter days of the month. In March 2001, DJIA plunged 1469 points (-11.8%) from March 9 to the 22.

> Normally a decent performing market month, March is somewhat above average in election years with advances 64.7% of the time with a 1.0% average DJIA gain since 1952. S&P 500 has also advanced 64.7% of the time since 1952, but gains have been slightly better at 1.2%, on average. NASDAQ has not fared well in March in election years since 1972. Due to a 17.1% loss in 1980, March is NASDAQ’s second worst month of the election year. Similarly, March 1980’s steep losses adversely affect Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 indices.

# Performance Throughout The Presidencies

> As markets were closed to observe Presidents Day yesterday and the 2020 Presidential election continues to ramp up, we thought it would be a good time to check up on stock performance during different administrations. In the table below, we show the performance of the Dow during the administrations of every US president since 1900 in addition to the annualized return. In the time since President Trump was sworn into office, the Dow has risen 46.9%. On an annualized basis, the 13.3% return places the current administration in 3rd place for the strongest performance. Only the Clinton administration in the 1990s and Coolidge administration in the 1920s have observed stronger annualized gains. The one caveat of course is that President Trump's term (or terms) has yet to end. Comparing Democratic and Republican administrations since 1900, Democratic presidencies have tended to average stronger returns than their Republican peers, so the stock market's returns under President Trump have deviated somewhat from the norm.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/021820-Presidents1.png))**

> While it is impossible to say what a candidate's election will mean for the market, at the moment betting markets favor the incumbent to win the presidency while Bernie Sanders and Michael Bloomberg go back and forth in taking the number 2 spot, hovering around 15%-16%. Come Super Tuesday (March 3rd) when we could finally see more clarity on the Democratic side, the back and forth between Bloomberg and Sanders might become more one-sided.

# Yet Another Corona Friday

> The major indices decided it was five o'clock somewhere right off the bat today as they experience yet another ""Corona Friday"". More concerns around the coronavirus have sent stocks lower with the S&P 500 down around 1.1% as of this writing and the Nasdaq down nearly 2% today. Declines on a Friday have become par for the course in 2020. Fridays have been the weakest day of the week so far in 2020; the only one to average a decline. On average, the S&P 500 has fallen 0.52% on Fridays while the next worst day has been Monday which has averaged a gain of 0.19%. Fridays have also been the day that the S&P 500 has closed higher the least. Only 28.6% of Fridays this year have seen the S&P 500 finish in the green. That compares to a positive close more than three-quarters of the time on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays. While it has averaged a gain of 0.24%, Tuesdays have also experienced a positive close less than half of the time. Try Bespoke's premium research package for free for two weeks.

# New All-Time Highs for S&P 500 and NASDAQ – Well Above Average Gains in Election Year

> As of today’s close, DJIA is up 2.84%, S&P 500 +4.81% and NASDAQ is up a whopping 9.41% year-to-date. All three indexes are well above their respective historical averages for this time of an election year. NASDAQ has in fact already exceeded its average full election year performance going back to 1972. Bullish sentiment and momentum appear to be firmly in place and historical election year patterns suggests strength could easily continue for DJIA and S&P 500 into May. NASDAQ’s surge higher could be vulnerable to a retreat sooner, in March.

# A Dow Without Boeing (BA)

> For more than a year now, Boeing (BA) has been plagued by the 737 MAX crisis which has weighed on shares of the plane manufacturer with it now currently down nearly 20% from when the initial groundings took place on March 10th of last year. Despite this, while underperforming the broader market due to the 737 issues, the stock is actually still up just over 5% since the start of 2019.

> Even though BA has lagged, it is still the highest-priced of the 30 stocks in the price-weighted Dow Jones Industrial Average. Currently trading around $338.50, the only stocks in the index holding a candle to BA are Apple (AAPL) and UnitedHealth (UNH), which also trade north of $300 per share. That means these stocks have the highest weighting in the index and therefore have a much larger impact than other stocks on the Dow's performance.

> With BA's issues, a number of people have pondered the what-ifs for the Dow had the company not had the issues with the 737. Would we have already broken out the Dow 30K hats were it not for BA? In the chart below, we show the actual performance of the DJIA and have overlaid the performance of an 'alternate Dow' showing its performance if BA had not been in the index since the start of 2019. We used the start of 2019 instead of the actual date of the groundings as it is a little less arbitrary. By our calculations, while we would be a bit closer, even if BA wasn't in the index since the start of 2019, we wouldn't quite be at Dow 30K yet. As shown, our alternate Dow would be almost 1% or 266 points higher if Boeing was not included in the index since the start of 2019.

> While BA has been a drag on the DJIA since last March, it also provided a big boost to the index in early 2018 before the 737 issues hit the stock. In fact, at the start of March 2017, BA was up over 36% YTD and the spread between the Dow's performance with and without BA was around 700 points in the other direction as it is now!

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/021920-Dow-wo-BA-2.png))**

> Another example of this dynamic in which high priced stocks have a greater impact on the index was observed on Tuesday when Apple's (AAPL) stock fell after the company warned that Q1 revenues would be shy of prior guidance due to the coronavirus. The warnings sent shares down over 3% at its intraday lows, but the stock only finished down 1.83%. While there were equivalent or larger declines like Dow (DOW) or Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) in Tuesday's session, AAPL's declines by far weighed on the index more than any other stock. Of the Dow's 165.89 point decline, AAPL contributed 40.35 points. Fortunately, UNH helped to mitigate some of those losses as it had a positive impact on the index of +22.79 points.

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning March 30th, 2020",122,fqldcx,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fqldcx/wall_street_week_ahead_for_the_trading_week/,22,2020-03-28 20:09:45,"Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 30th, 2020.

# **What could be ‘shocker’ economic reports may test stocks in week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/27/what-could-be-shocker-economic-reports-may-test-stocks-in-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> Everything from auto sales to manufacturing surveys and employment data in the coming week will likely paint a bleak picture of how much the first weeks of the coronavirus shutdown have already hit the economy.
*****
> Market turbulence is expected to remain high, though volatile moves in the past week were largely to the upside. The S&P 500, by Thursday, had soared 20% intraday off its Monday low, before giving up some gains Friday. For the week, the S&P 500 was up 10.3% at 2,541.
*****
> The market’s rip higher ignited a debate about whether stocks have now bottomed, and that discussion will carry on into the week ahead. Some major investors like billionaire investor Leon Cooperman and BlackRock’s Rick Rieder believe stocks may have hit their lows. Other strategists say the market needs to see a retest before a bottom can be called.
*****
> “It’s amazing to me that people are so bullish when virus cases are accelerating and economic growth is deteriorating,” said Richard Bernstein, CEO Richard Bernstein Advisors. “I could see it if cases peaked out, and the economy is troughing.”
*****
> # It’s the economy
> In the coming week, the big number to watch could again be Thursday’s weekly jobless claims, up a record 3.2 million for the week ended March 21, as the shutdown of stores, restaurants, and other businesses across the country resulted in immediate layoffs. 
*****
> Economists expect several million more claims to be filed for the past week, and they are looking at that new claims report as potentially more important than Friday’s March employment report. The survey week for the March jobs report was ahead of some of the major shutdowns by the states most impacted by the virus. Economists expect nonfarm payrolls to drop by 56,000 in March, according to Dow Jones.
*****
> Other data could show some of the early signs of an economy brought to a standstill. There are auto sales and ISM manufacturing releases on Wednesday, both March reports. Service sector data will be released Friday.
*****
> Market focus will be more intensely focused on the economic data, shifting from the $2 trillion aid bill, signed by President Donald Trump on Friday. Economists expect the economy already may be in a slowdown and that it should trough with a double-digit decline in the nation’s gross domestic product in the second quarter.
*****
> Vehicle sales will be reported Wednesday, and sales are expected to have come to a near standstill even though shuttered dealerships continue trying to deliver autos to buyers.
*****
> For “car sales, I would think the drop would be more precipitous,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton. “They shut down in every major market. Even though they’re offering deliveries and all that stuff, it’s going to be a shocker ... large double digit decline.”
*****
> Auto sales were at an annualized pace of 16.8 million in February, and some economists say the number in March could be closer to 12 million.
*****
> Congress passed a $2 trillion aid package to help put cash in the hands of workers and companies, so they can weather the effects of a shutdown.
*****
> Separately, the Fed has delivered a massive amount of monetary stimulus that has helped ease up some of the problems in illiquid credit and even the Treasury market.  It has been buying Treasury and mortgage-backed securities at a record pace of $70 billion a day, and markets are focused on when the Fed will alter the size of its purchases, which are open-ended.
*****
> “This week, plus last week was more than $600 billion. It’s monumental.” said Michael Schumacher, director, rates at Wells Fargo. The Fed said it was reducing the purchases to $60 billion a day, which is the amount it had been buying in a one-month period.
*****
> # Stimulus one-two punch
> The double-barreled boost to markets from the Fed’s policy and the prospect of the fiscal spending package helped fire up the mid-week rally in stocks. 
*****
> “Even though the market, from the intraday low on March 23 through the intraday high on March 26, soared more than 20%, which to many is the definition of a new bull market, this low must be sustained before a new bull market can be crowned,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. “We’ve got to maintain this recent low, in my opinion, for another six months before we can call this another bull market.”
*****
> Stovall said the S&P 500 is often higher in April, though this year it may not be. The S&P is down about 14% for the month of March so far. Since World War II,  April has been the second best month for the S&P, which has been up an average 1.5% and higher 71% of the time.
*****
> The big rally in stocks this week is not an unusual occurrence in a bear market, Stovall said. “There have been multiple times in history - 1973/1974, 2001/2002, and combined with 2008, 2009, that we saw 20 plus percent rallies before ultimately setting an even lower low.”
*****
> Stovall said it’s likely there will be a lower low. “The only think that causes me to say we may not retest the bottom is everybody is saying we need to retest the bottom,” he said. The S&P hit a low of 2,191 before bouncing higher.
*****
> # Credit un-crunching
> In addition to its Treasury and mortgage purchases, the Fed has cut rates to zero, added liquidity in the repo market and committed to creating vehicles to help corporate paper, municipal bonds and corporate debt.
*****
> “Stress levels in financial markets have receded in a meaningful way this week, thanks in no small part to the Fed’s aggressive moves.  Leveraged loans rebounded somewhat in price yesterday, and the MBS market is seeing broadening improvement (though it is far from normal),” noted Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont.
*****
> Stanley said the Fed may not need to buy corporate bonds for now, based on new issuance activity in that market this week.

# Will the Fed’s Bold Moves Keep Yields from Rising?

> With the major stock market indexes all entering a bear market this month, it’s no surprise that stocks have stolen most of the spotlight. However, actions taken by the Federal Reserve (Fed) to support what may be considered the safest part of the bond market, US Treasuries, may actually have more lasting implications for investors’ portfolios.

> From February 19 through midday March 9, the yield on the 10-year Treasury fell an incredible 125 basis points (1.25%), briefly reaching an all-time low of just 0.31%. In fact, the 14-day relative strength index RSI on the 10-year yield, a technical measure of momentum, was more oversold than at any point since 1971. Since then yields came roaring back, trading as high as 1.27%, before fading back to near 0.8% currently.

> It is logical to think that the incredibly bold moves from the Fed, including unlimited Treasuries purchases, will help keep yields down. But could yields actually rise from here after the Fed writes the bond market a blank check? History says yes, which seems counter-intuitive. For investors, it’s important to keep in mind that the combination of low starting yields and rising interest rates may lead to meager future fixed income returns.

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, following prior announcements of quantitative easing (Fed securities purchases), yields have actually risen. Part of that story is the market pricing in higher inflation expectations as a result of the “money printing.” Another piece is the market becoming more confident in economic recovery. “The massive injection of liquidity into the bond market by the Federal Reserve—in concert with fiscal stimulus—surely helps shore up the economy and credit marekts for an eventual recovery,” noted LPL Financial Sr. Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

> LPL Research forecasts the 10-year Treasury yield will end 2020 in the range of 1.25-1.75%. Outcomes outside of that range are certainly possible depending on how long it takes to get the pandemic under control.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Yields-after-QE.png?ssl=1))**

> If the roughly $2 trillion in fiscal stimulus is added to the Fed’s securities purchases, and additional lending capacity that the Fed’s new programs create, the economy will get a $5-6 trillion jolt in the next several months to help us get through this crisis to the other side. In a $22 trillion US economy, that is significant and far exceeds the stimulus that dug the economy out of a ditch after the 2008-2009 financial crisis. This human crisis is not over unfortunately, but the bold moves from policymakers should help lessen the blow. The size of hit became evident in Thursday’s massive spike in jobless claims. The economic data will get worse before it gets better, but visibility into the peak of this crisis is starting to come into view and markets—both stocks and bonds—may be beginning to sniff that out.

*****

# Making Sense of Skyrocketing Jobless Claims

> Weekly new jobless claims were reported this morning, and to no one’s surprise they rose to levels thought unimaginable just a few weeks ago. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, 3.3 million people filed new claims for unemployment benefits in the week ending March 21, almost 5 times the previous high of 695,000 set in 1982.

> “The personal and economic disruptions represented by the latest new claims number are staggering,” said LPL Chief Investment Officer Burt White. “This is a genuine human crisis, and a robust response from the Federal Reserve and Congress seems appropriate. Unfortunately, we do expect more numbers like this in the coming months. At the same time, markets are forward looking and will be more focused on how quickly we might be able to get to the other side.” Per LPL’s Chart of the Day:

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Blog-Chart-20-03-26-New-Claims.png?ssl=1))**

> While the number of new claims is extraordinary, it’s not entirely unexpected. The United States and countries across the globe have shut down entire segments of their economies in an effort to delay or disrupt the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of the jobs most impacted by social-distancing measures, such as cashiers, restaurant workers, and hotel staff, are in the services sector, which now makes up about 80% of the jobs in the United States.

> There is no silver lining in a number like this, but there is reason for hope. The US economy was not in a recession prior to the global spread of COVID-19. Workers are not being let go because of some structural fault in the economy or a financial crisis. As a result, when the slowdown ends, we may not see the extended hiring delay that has typically followed recessions. In fact, a surge in demand may require extra hiring, although it may not take place until people are fully confident that social distancing is no longer necessary.

> Markets may not be responding to the dramatic numbers seen this morning, but they have been absorbing the rapidly changing economic expectations it represents over the last few weeks. We’ll see a lot of this over the next couple of months: historic numbers with markets seemingly unmoved. But it’s not because they’re indifferent. Economic data is slow moving and backward looking, while our economic reality has been changing at an unprecedented pace. Even new unemployment claims, which are released weekly, seem somewhat stale. Markets will still be reacting to shifting expectations of the depth and duration of the slowdown, as well as the effectiveness of policies to help businesses and workers get to the other side.

# Market Volatility Stresses Liquidity

> The COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented volatility in recent weeks that has investors and traders scrambling to assess the economic and market impact of the aggressive containment measures.

> This past week the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), which measures the implied 30-day volatility of the S&P 500 Index based on options contracts, measured its highest reading since its inception at over 82—besting the prior high set during the financial crisis in 2008-2009, shown in the chart below. That is saying something.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Blog-volatility.png?ssl=1))**

> As market participants have sought shelter from the storm in traditional safe havens such as US Treasuries, gold, or cash, we have seen signs that liquidity has dried up. All that means is buyers have become more tentative, demanding lower prices to get trades done due to the historic volatility and heightened uncertainty. That in turn can lead to wider bid-ask spreads for market participants—both retail investors and institutions—and we sometimes see a dollar of value selling for 95 cents, if not less.

> We have seen some of this in the corporate bond markets in recent days. Even short-maturity, high-quality investment grade corporate bond strategies have seen market prices disconnect with their fair value, as measured by net asset value (NAV). That metric essentially adds up the value of individual bonds in a portfolio such as an exchange-traded fund, which should in theory match the market price of the security that we all see on our screens.

> “In volatile markets, quality items go on sale to clear the racks because there aren’t a lot of shoppers walking through the malls,” noted Ryan Detrick, LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist. “Improving liquidity in all markets can help restore investor confidence after being shaken the past few weeks.”

> At their worst, these conditions can translate into serious dislocations, such as those experienced during the financial crisis when banks didn’t trust each other enough to make overnight loans and credit froze up. Short-term lending is a necessary lubricant for economic activity.

> Investors can get hurt selling into these dislocated markets. This is where the Federal Reserve (Fed) comes in. The programs the Fed launched on Monday, March 23—including buying large amounts of corporate bonds—are aimed at restoring health to credit markets. The central bank’s aggressive bond purchases (as much as needed) should help restore orderly trading in corporate bonds and narrow spreads, a measure of risk, which have widened significantly in recent weeks. As shown in the chart below, spreads are still well short of 2008-2009 highs.

> There is some other good news here. These dislocations can present opportunities for buyers to get discounts they may not otherwise see in normally functioning market environments. We aren’t suggesting running out and buying securities trading at the biggest discounts to their intrinsic value. Instead, we are highlighting that attractive opportunities are emerging in the corporate bond market, particularly in strategies focused on strong companies that may emerge on the other side of this crisis as leaders of the economic rebound.

# Time In The Market Versus Timing The Market

> The incredible volatility continues, with the S&P 500 Index now in one of its worst bear markets ever, along the way making the quickest move from an all-time high to down 30% at only 22 days. What is a long-term investor to do?

> “Although market timing is very alluring to investors, especially after the past few weeks, the reality is timing things incorrectly can set you back significantly,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “In fact, if you started in 1990 and missed the best day of the year each year for the S&P 500, your annual return was nearly cut in half.”

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the annualized return for the S&P 500 from 1990 to 2019 was 7.7%. Yet, if all you missed was the best day of the year, that return dropped to only 3.9%. Miss the best two days of each year, and you were up less than 1% a year. Taking it to the extreme, if you missed the best 20 days of each year, you’d be down 27% per year.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/chart-3.24.png?ssl=1))**

> No one can consistently pick the best or worst days of the year, so this is why it can be so dangerous for investors to miss time in the market by trying to time the market. If you miss one or two big days, compounded over time, this can greatly impact your portfolio.

# Boeing (BA) Sends the Dow Flying

> Turnaround Tuesday has carried into hump day with the Dow up well over 5% again today as of this writing. As we mentioned in an earlier post, that means the Dow is on track for its first back-to-back up days for the first time since early February. Remarkably, even with only two consecutive up days, the index is closing in on exiting a bear market. For that to happen, the Dow would need to close above the 22,310.32 level which is 20% off of the bear market closing low (Monday's close at 18,591.93). At today's high, the Dow was less than 300 points or 1.32% from that level.

> As for the individual stocks contributing to the rally, Boeing (BA) deserves a lot of thanks. The stock has been hit very hard during the sell-off. Whereas the stock has traded in the mid-$300 for much of the past two years and up to mid-February, as of late last week BA had fallen below $100. That massive drop in price means that day to day movements in the stock would have a lesser impact on the level of the price-weighted Dow. In spite of this, BA has contributed over 400 points to the Dow's rally in the past two days alone! That is much more than any other stock in the index with the next biggest contributor being UnitedHealth (UNH) who's 335.44 point contribution comes as its share price is currently around $100 more than BA. BA's contribution is also almost 200 points more than those of McDonald's (MCD), Visa (V), and Apple (AAPL). Of all 30 Dow stocks, there is only one that is down over the past couple of days, subtracting from the index's rally: Walmart (WMT). Given WMT has held up fairly well recently, its performance is yet another example of investors' focus on the more beaten down names that we have noted earlier today and in last night's Closer.

#Trading Update

*  What’s happening this morning? There were a bunch of headlines but the broader US
narrative isn’t changing dramatically (US S&P futures are flat-to-up 1 point). The main eco
highlight this morning was the China Sept inflation numbers (CPI was inline while PPI
firmed by more than expected). Recall it was the China Aug inflation numbers back on 9/11
that kicked off the recent reflation trade. Central bank messaging was very mixed over the
weekend as a slew of officials spoke on the sidelines of the IMF/World Bank meetings; the
coming meetings are likely to bring tightening rhetoric/actions (ECB tapering guidance
10/26, BOE hike 11/2, FOMC hike 12/13) but officials remain concerned about the state of
global inflation (and Draghi emphasized on more than one occasion how ECB ZIRP would
likely stay in place for some time after the end of the LSAP). A Bloomberg article this
morning talks about how the ECB may run out of QE capacity soon (the limit may be EU2.5T
but the ECB will have bought EU2.3T by the end of this year). On the political front, US Sen.
Susan Collins said she would likely vote “yes” on this week’s budget resolution (passage is
necessary for tax but this is a relatively minor step in the overall process), the Catalonia
situation remains unresolved as the region failed to clarify whether it intended to declare
independence (it faces a new deadline this Thurs morning), tensions flared in Iraq as gov’t
forces moved to recapture Kurdish-held oil fields and a military base near Kirkuk (this news
has oil up ~1% this morning), and polls in Japan point to a strong victory for Abe’s coalition
(the election is Sun 10/22). Stocks in Asia generally did well – TPX +0.62%, NKY +0.47%,
Hang Seng +0.76%, HSCEI +0.72%, SHCOMP -0.36%, Taiwan +0.47%, Korea +0.26%,
Australia +0.56%, and India up ~60bp. Tech stocks in Korea continued to bleed lower
(Hynix -2.2%, Samsung Electronics -0.15%) while they generally saw gains in Taiwan (Largan
+4.05%, Hon Hai +1.4%, Quanta +7%, TSMC +0.21%, etc.). Europe’s major indices are flatto-
up small; basic resources are the big upside standout (SXPP +1.6% - it was bolstered Fri
on the China import numbers and the PPI figure out of the country is helping this morning)
while chemicals, media, healthcare, and energy are all doing well too; industrials, staples,
tech, and utilities are small laggards. Convatec Group PLC is down ~20% after issuing a
profit warning and Kuehne + Nagel is weak on earnings.
o Tactically fade reflation as narrative begins fraying at the margin; 2-10 TSY spread
just a few BPs from hitting 52w tights – the reflation narrative has enjoyed several
weeks of uninterruptedly favorable news, including firming inflation, solid real
growth, expansionary fiscal policy announcements, and hawkish CB
rhetoric/decisions. However, the news is beginning to turn more neutral at the
margin and this could cause pro-reflation themes to consolidate (at least).
*  Calendar of events for the week of Mon 10/16 – the main focus this week will be on
earnings, China, and US taxes. The China National Congress kicks off Wed 10/18 and the
country will be publishing a lot of eco data (inflation out Mon morning 10/16 and Q3 GDP
along w/Sept retail sales/IP/FAI out Thurs morning 10/19). Investors will keep an eye on
North Korea as media reports suggest the country could fire off some missiles around the
China Congress. In the US investors will be digesting earnings (the week of 10/16 is the first
busy one of the CQ3 season) and macro news should be limited aside from some Fed
speakers (including Yellen who speaks Fri 10/20 after the close). The US tax process will
continue w/the Senate voting on a budget resolution (likely Thurs 10/19) - passage is
expected but the final vote will likely be close; Rand Paul seems a hard “no” while McCain
and a few others are question marks; investors will be watching to see if any Democrats
cross the aisle. Keep in mind that the Senate budget resolution will need to be reconciled
w/the one from the House. Finally, the EU Leaders Summit runs 10/19-20 and the Japanese
snap election takes place Sun 10/22.
*  Calendar for Mon 10/16 – the focus will be on earnings (SCHW pre-open and BRO, CE, IEX,
NAVI, NFLX, Rio Tinto, RT, and SONC after the close).

#Top Headlines for Monday

*  Economic data/monetary policy recap for Mon 10/16 – the main highlight this morning
were China inflation numbers and the figures were generally solid (http://bit.ly/2yk55wf).
CPI for Sept was largely inline (+1.6%) while PPI firmed by more than anticipated (+6.9% vs.
JPM +6.3% and vs. the St +6.4%).
o Central bank leadership uncertainty – Reuters discusses how the world’s major
central banks may all see leadership changes over the next 1-2 years. The Fed,
BOJ, and PBOC may all have new leaders in early ’18 while Draghi is due to depart
the scene the following year. Reuters http://reut.rs/2yqVWkJ
o Central bankers adopt dovish tone regarding policy at weekend IMF/World Bank
meetings given tepid inflation trends – “central bankers cling to stimulus amid
weak inflation” – WSJ http://on.wsj.com/2gIt6TW
o Rosengren said in an interview Friday that a Fed rate hike in Dec remained likely.
“A failure to tighten would risk both the labor market and financial prices getting
into an area where we would have to react more quickly, and that would increase
the probability that we end up having a recession” (WSJ
http://on.wsj.com/2ieTh88); Rosengren added that he anticipates 3-4 hikes next
year (Reuters http://reut.rs/2xIze41).
o ECB running out of QE capacity – total ECB bond purchases will hit EU2.28T by the
end of ’17 and some within the central bank think the ultimate limit is only EU2.5T
(meaning it may only be able to purchase an additional ~EU200B worth of bonds in
2018) – Bloomberg. https://bloom.bg/2xIiBFP
o China’s central bank governor said growth in the country could accelerate slightly
to +7% in H2 – Reuters http://bit.ly/2xIsRTa
*  US taxes – while Republican deficit hawks aren’t nearly as assertive as they once were,
disagreements over the fiscal implications of the GOP’s tax plan risk imploding the entire
initiative. Politico http://politi.co/2idPsjK
*  US taxes – mortgage interest deduction to stay but become worthless? The GOP blueprint
would double the standard deduction for individuals and couples, making the mortgage
interest deduction worthless for anyone who doesn’t itemize. WSJ
http://on.wsj.com/2ieCnGC
*  Thy God Emperor Trump privately predicts he will appoint four Supreme Court justices by the end of his first
term – Axios http://bit.ly/2yr549d
*  Spain – Catalonia’s leader failed to clarify by a Mon morning deadline whether he declared
the region independent. Spain has warned that anything but an unequivocal statement
would be taken as a declaration of secession and invite reprisal from Madrid. Catalonia
now has until Thurs morning to provide additional clarity. WSJ.
http://on.wsj.com/2gdue15
*  Iraq tensions escalate - Iraqi forces moved to recapture Kurdish-held oil fields and a military
base near the city of Kirkuk; the Iraqi gov’t was looking to recapture terrain it held prior to
2014 (when it abandoned the territory in the face of an ISIS assault) – Washington Post.
http://wapo.st/2zc0aKL
*  Japan – Abe’s ruling coalition is on track for a big win in the upcoming election (the election

w/regulators rather than volunteer asset sales) – Reuters http://reut.rs/2hJizrc
*  CHTR, VIA’b – the companies agreed to a short-term carriage extension so as to avoid an
immediate blackout of Viacom channels on CHTR’s systems – Reuters
http://nyti.ms/2yr561e
*  FB is looking to hire people w/national security clearance as it looks to battle against
foreign operators looking to exploit its social network – Bloomberg
*  GE – the WSJ thinks GE should be aggressive in resetting expectations and capitalized on
neg. investor sentiment; by frontloading the bad news now, GE could dramatically reset the
bar and begin delivering upside surprises for investors down the road – WSJ.
http://on.wsj.com/2zcVUuD
*  GE – the FT speculates on a dividend cut at GE – “GE is failing to cover its dividend
payments from its core operating cash flows, a position that is ultimately unsustainable”; GE
reports earnings Fri 10/20 and will update investors on 11/13; if the 11/13 restructuring
plan isn’t aggressive enough, GE’s new mgmt. team could face pressure to break the
company apart – FT http://on.ft.com/2kStpzO
*  Bombardier – the co is seeking investors for its aerospace businesses and is considering the
sale of some operations; Airbus could buy certain assets from Bombardier – Bloomberg.
https://bloom.bg/2gedsPc
*  ARMK will buy two private companies (Avendra and AmeriPride) for a combined $2.35B.
WSJ. http://on.wsj.com/2ylUDUY
*  Brooklyn Nets – Mikhail Prokhorov is seeking a valuation of ~$2B for the team as he pursues
a sale – NY Post. http://nyp.st/2wXryeB
Top Headlines from the Weekend
*  Sentiment – the cover article in this week’s Barron’s, entitled “Echoes of the 1987 Crash”
(http://bit.ly/2gjdXeu), can hardly be accused of optimism (it focuses on the market’s
structural changes and the rise of technology, including quant-based strategies and ETFs,
and how this could sow the seeds for an ’87-like crash) but its sentiments aren’t necessarily
unique either. The recent Economist title (from 10/7) lamented elevated asset valuations
(“The bull market in everything” http://econ.st/2xVXOjv) and warned of what will happen
once central banks begin withdrawing liquidity. BLK’s Larry Fink on Friday warned that risks
in the financial system at present are comparable to 2007 levels (http://reut.rs/2zmk5ax).
o Investors are right to be nervous but not necessarily because of technology or
central banks. Rather, the fact the economy is late-cycle with valuations near peak
levels is the main source of risk when it comes to equities. However, late-cycle
doesn’t mean end-cycle (as discussed in this JPMorgan note http://bit.ly/2wTZRCK)
and the absence of gross imbalances suggests a downturn isn’t imminent while
multiples can easily expand a few additional turns (and each turn means ~140 SPX
points given current earnings estimates while tax may add ~$7-10+ to EPS).
o Flow vs. stock – central bank liquidity. The Wall St narrative when it comes to
central banks and LSAPs tends to emphasize the “flow” piece of the equation (i.e.
the actual buying of assets) but it is in fact the ownership of assets (“stock”) that
acts as the mechanism for accommodation. Therefore rather than focus on central
bank buying to gauge the appropriation of liquidity it is more critical to assess
balance sheet size and on that basis central banks don’t appear on the cusp of an
acute liquidity withdrawal (as discussed in this JPMorgan note – G4 CB balance
sheets will be little changed over the next 3-4 years http://bit.ly/2xAACJL).
*  Yellen delivered comments Sun 10/15 in conjunction w/the IMF/World Bank meetings in
Washington. Overall her speech echoed many of the same sentiments she’s expressed in
recent communications and the a rate hike on 12/13 still seems likely. “Economic activity
in the United States has been growing moderately so far this year, and the labor market has
continued to strengthen”. Yellen says the recent storms will likely depress economic activity
but only temporarily (she thinks jobs growth will rebound from the depressed -33K pace of
Sept). “Wage indicators have been mixed, and the most recent news, on average hourly
earnings through September, was encouraging”. Yellen thinks inflation will firm from the
current soft trend (“my best guess is that these soft readings will not persist, and with the
ongoing strengthening of labor markets, I expect inflation to move higher next year”)
although she does acknowledge that something more structural may be occurring (“the
fact that a number of other advanced economies are also experiencing persistently low
inflation understandably adds to the sense among many analysts that something more
structural may be going on…. we will be paying close attention to the inflation data in the
months ahead”). http://bit.ly/2ykNjZM
o Kuroda spoke over the weekend in Washington and said the BOJ would continue
pursuing an aggressive monetary easing policy. “Achieving the 2% target is still a
long way off”. WSJ. http://on.wsj.com/2kPwAZ3
o Draghi spoke positively about Eurozone growth but he reiterated a cautious view
on inflation; Draghi said underlying inflation remains too weak and as a result the
ECB would need to continue providing large degrees of monetary accomodation.
WSJ http://on.wsj.com/2yLTeb9
o Central banks – tightening actions/rhetoric expected from three of the four major
central banks before the end of the year: EBC 10/26 (media reports suggest the
LSAP will be extended by 9 months w/the purchase pace tapered down from EU60B
to ~EU30B), BOE 11/2 (market expects a hike), and FOMC 12/13 (market expects a
hike).
*  Global central bankers and fin mins watch Fed chair process very closely – the identity of
the next Fed chair was as key topic of conversation at the weekend IMF/World Bank
meetings in Washington according to the WSJ (http://on.wsj.com/2gbzPor).
o Why will be the next Fed chair? All the media reports suggest the race is still
between Warsh and Powell (with the former person having a small edge) although
John Taylor’s name is being mentioned more (Thy God Emperor Trump interviewed Taylor at the
White House on Wed according to multiple media reports); of all the chair
candidates (Warsh, Powell, Yellen, Cohn, and Taylor), Taylor would likely cause the
most market disruption (at least initially). Larry Kudlow spoke on CNBC Fri
afternoon (after the market close) and said Thy God Emperor Trump’s decision could wind up being
a Warsh/Taylor combination (chair/vice chair).
*  Budget resolution vote coming up in the Senate (likely Thurs 10/19) - Larry Kudlow on
CNBC (at 4:40pmET Fri afternoon) reiterated that 50 GOP votes don't exist right now for
the budget resolution in the Senate (the vote is tentatively scheduled for Thurs
10/19). Republican Sen. Thad Cochran's health issues (which could keep him from
Washington) will complicate things for Republicans (Cochran was discussed in Politico Fri
morning http://politi.co/2i8Plpu).
o Sen. Collins said she would likely vote “yes” on the budget resolution this week
(passing the budget resolution is a necessary, but rather minor, step in the tax
process) – Reuters http://reut.rs/2wWzOvv
*  Taxes – passing a budget resolution is the easy part
o Republicans are still struggling to reach a consensus around the most controversial
pieces of the 9/27 blueprint. This week’s budget resolution vote is a necessary but
rather easy part of the tax process. The harder parts of the tax debate are still
waiting awaiting resolution – rates, brackets, income thresholds, deduction
changes, deficit tolerance, etc. BAT and SALT were supposed to be the key
incremental sources of revenue to pay for reduced rates but one is already scrapped
(BAT) and the other (SALT) is facing enormous resistance. Some media reports
suggest Republicans may reach a SALT compromise (whereby individuals with
annual incomes of ~$400K+ will lose the ability to deduct SALT) but this doesn’t
raise a whole lot of revenue. Even with reasonable dynamic scoring, it gets very
difficult to lower rates meaningfully without any incremental revenue.
o Tax – what will pass and when? Investors still think “something” can happen but
that something will likely be much less ambitious than the 9/27 GOP blueprint
(corporate rate to ~25-30% w/some lower/middle-income individual relief). Nearly
no one expects tax action in 2017.
o Tax – what is priced into stocks? This question is being asked w/increased
frequency but providing a precise answer is difficult. Roughly speaking, the St is
penciling in ~$138-143 in tax-free 2018 SPX EPS w/a tax bill adding ~$5-15. At the
middle of the tax-free range (i.e. $140) the SPX PE is ~18.2x – assuming investors
would try and keep the PE around ~17.5x that would imply a 2018 EPS expectation
of ~$145 which suggests stocks are assuming some benefit from tax (albeit a
relatively small one).
*  Thy God Emperor Trump risks overloading Congress – Thy God Emperor Trump has thrown several contentious issues in the lap
of Congress just as Senate and House Republicans undertake the most dramatic overhaul of
the tax code since ’86. Between immigration/DACA, the Iran nuclear pact, and
healthcare/ACA, Congress will be forced to act over the coming months while also juggling
the tax debate. WSJ http://on.wsj.com/2wUhTFF
o Thy God Emperor Trump’s move to end ACA exchange subsidies raises the risk of a gov’t shutdown
on 12/8; Democrats may demand the funds be authorized legislatively or threaten a
shutdown – Washington Post. http://wapo.st/2z7C7MT
*  Thy God Emperor Trump backs Bannon on pledge to primary insubordinate Republicans – Thy God Emperor Trump called
Bannon and offered words of encouragement to the former strategist over his pledge to
oppose any Republican not actively backing the president’s agenda – WSJ

o Bannon reiterates his disgust w/”Establishment Republicans” and vows “war”
against McConnell – Bannon spoke over the weekend at the Values Voter Summit in
Washington. http://politi.co/2ig3Mby

ABC http://abcn.ws/2ylNJge
*  Thy God Emperor Trump vs. Corker feud continues – Sen. Corker spoke to the Washington Post on Friday and

*  Health insurers were preparing for the ACA subsidies to end and many signaled an intent
to stay in the exchanges – WSJ http://on.wsj.com/2znlnlL
o Healthcare - Thy God Emperor Trump would oppose any legislative attempt to ""fix"" the ACA
exchanges and restore subsidy payments unless he got something in return –
Politico http://politi.co/2ggN3nJ
o Drug price battle shifts from Washington to the states – pharma companies are
fighting a host of drug price-control measures being adopted by states across the
US. FT http://on.ft.com/2yLrcwp
*  NAFTA talks aren’t going well – demands made by the US last week have increased the
odds of NAFTA’s demise (at the least the demands make it unlikely an agreement on NAFTA
changes will be reached by the end of the year) – Reuters http://reut.rs/2zaxZM4
o NAFTA demise emerging as a new risk for investors – the risk of NAFTA collapsing is
rising and this is something investors are beginning to consider. WSJ
http://on.wsj.com/2yniIs8
*  China economic growth – China’s money supply statistics were released over the weekend
and they came in strong. M2 money supply rose 9.2% in Sept (vs. the St +8.9%) while new
yuan loans came in at CNY1.27T (vs. the St CNY1.2T); see JPMorgan’s takeaways here:
http://bit.ly/2wXModQ. The head of China’s central bank spoke over the weekend and said
economic indicators show “stabilized and stronger growth” (https://bloom.bg/2xHjYJy).
*  German coalition gov’t unlikely to form until 2018 – Reuters http://reut.rs/2yJ2JYo
o Merkel’s CDU suffered a defeat in Lower Saxony state elections (the SPD secured
37.5% compared to 35% for the CDU) – Bloomberg https://bloom.bg/2gkmJZJ
*  Austria – Sebastian Kurz looks set to become the next chancellor of Austria although his
People’s Party (OVP) failed to win an outright majority (it secured 57 out of 183 seats). The
OVP is widely expected to form a coalition with the Freedom Party (FPO) which secured 51
seats. CNN. http://cnn.it/2ykzIlo
*  North Korea – the US and South Korea will hold joint navel exercises this week; media
reports suggest a NK missile test could come at any time – Bloomberg/WSJ.

vulnerabilities; the Pentagon is concerned about hackers sowing instability and chaos on US
financial markets. Some of the scenarios thought up by the group of Pentagon advisors
include flooding the market w/false information and/or fake sell orders or hacking a key cog
in the system (such as a credit-card company, payment processor, or payroll processor).

"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning January 6th, 2020",97,ejx893,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ejx893/wall_street_week_ahead_for_the_trading_week/,25,2020-01-04 19:57:23,"Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 6th, 2020.

# **Geopolitical tensions could hold back stocks in the week ahead, as investors await jobs report  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/03/geopolitical-tensions-could-hold-back-stocks-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> Geopolitical concerns could continue to weigh on stocks in the week ahead, leaving investors wondering whether Middle East tensions will be the catalyst for a much anticipated market pullback.
*****
> Stocks sold off Friday, the second trading day of the year, after a rally to new highs on Thursday. The market was slammed after the U.S. killed Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani, sparking a rally in oil prices and raising concerns Iran will take some retaliatory action.
*****
> The big event in the coming week is the December employment report, expected to show 160,000 payrolls were added and average earnings rose 3.1% year-over-year, according to Refinitiv. The jobs report is especially important after December’s ISM manufacturing data Friday was surprisingly negative and the weakest in more than a decade.
*****
> The S&P 500 ended the four-day week at 3,235, with a loss of 0.2%, after Friday’s 0.7% decline. Treasury yields retreated on Friday, as buyers moved into the safety of bonds and the 10-year yield was at 1.78%.
*****
> “This was a textbook rationale for a bout of profit taking, but that said, I don’t think it’s dramatic,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. “Nonetheless, the question will be when do buyers come in ... Much will depend on this weekend and next week in terms of headlines from both the White House and Iran.”
*****
> Some analysts have been looking for a minor selloff in stocks after the fourth quarter’s 8.5% gain in the S&P 500. But whether Friday’s decline is the start of something bigger is unclear.
*****
> “It could be, but only in retrospect will you know for sure,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group.
*****
> Boockvar said if Iran takes some minor action, the market could shrug it off, oil could lose its gains, and stocks could move higher again.
*****
> “We may see Treasurys continue to get a big bid, gold get a bid and the safe-haven currencies get a bid. If we go into things next week and all things are quiet, the market will pay attention to the data,” Krosby said.
*****
> Gregory Faranello, head of U.S. rates at AmeriVet Securities, expects to see Treasury yields lower initially. “I think short-term, the geopolitical risk is probably going to override any fundamental views that people have of the marketplace,” he said.
*****
> But there could be a catalyst for some Treasury selling with the issuance of high level of corporate bonds in the coming week. Faranello expects the year to start off strong, with corporate treasurers looking to raise about $30 billion to $35 billion in the debt market.
*****
> Strategists said they will be looking closely at the jobs data after Friday’s surprisingly weak manufacturing survey from the Institute for Supply Management, which was expected to have been better because of the trade agreement.
*****
> Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont, said the survey actually took place before the trade deal was announced, and he’s waiting for the results of the next couple of reports.
*****
> He expects to see 165,000 jobs added in December, off of 266,000 in November, which was in part skewed by the end of GM’s strike. “I think there’s a little upside risk. It seems like we saw a pretty strong Christmas season,” he said, adding there could have been more hiring than was factored into seasonal adjustments.

# Typical January Trading: Volatile Last 20 Years

> Yesterday major indexes continued their recent trend of strength on the first trading day of 2020. While today the market has turned weaker on escalating tensions between the U.S. and Iran. This type of volatility was once quite rare in January. However since 2000, the S&P 500 has declined ten times in twenty years in January. This recent weakness can be seen in the above January seasonal pattern chart.

> Over the last 21 years, Only NASDAQ has posted a full-month average gain. DJIA, S&P 500 and Russell 1000 have started January positive, only to surrender early-month gains by the eighth trading day. Greatest weakness has appeared just after mid-month, the eleventh trading day. Mild average losses on or around the eleventh trading day quickly swell to over 2% for DJIA and nearly as much for S&P 500 and Russell 1000.

# A Banner Year for US Equities

> 2019 was surely a banner year for US equities. With a total return of 31.5%, the S&P 500's gain in 2019 was nearly three times the historical average 12-month return of 11.7%. That's strong! In the chart below we compare the S&P 500's annualized returns over the last one, two, five, ten, and twenty years to its average annualized returns over those same time frames since 1928. While the one-year return sticks out like a sore thumb, we would note that the S&P 500's annualized returns over the last two, three, and ten years are also above average. Almost as notable as the fact that the one year return has been so much stronger than average is that the S&P 500's two-year return is less than two percentage points above its historical average. That just shows how bad 2018 was! Looking further out, the only time frame where returns are below average is over the last twenty years where the 6.1% annualized gain is almost five percentage points below the historical average. Over a full twenty years, that's a difference of tripling your investment versus making eight times your investment!

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/010220-Annualized-returns.png))**

> The chart below compares how current returns during the above time frames rank on a percentile basis relative to all other periods. The S&P 500's one-year return ranks in the 85th percentile which is pretty extreme. For the two, five, and ten year periods, though, current returns are much more middle of the road. Conversely, as stretched as extreme to the upside that the one-year return is relative to all other periods, the twenty-year return is even more depressed to the downside. At just 4.6, more than 95% of all other 20-year periods have been better than the last 20.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/010220-Annualized-returns-Percentile.png))**

> Finally, as mentioned above the last year has certainly been a strong one, and it follows a year where returns had been abnormally poor. The chart below shows the rolling 12-month total return for the S&P 500 going back to 1990. The gain of 31.49% over the last year was the strongest for the S&P 500 in six years coming up just shy of the 32.39% gain in 2013. Last year at this time, though, the S&P 500 was down over 4% on a total return basis in the prior 12 months.

# 2019 and 2020 Dogs of the Dow

> The Dogs of the Dow strategy is a simple, hands-off investment approach that says to buy the 10 highest yielding stocks in the Dow 30 at the start of each year. With the calendar turning over from 2019 to 2020, below is a look at how the Dogs strategy performed in 2019. As shown, the 10 Dogs posted a total return of 19.38% in 2019, which was below the 25% return for the Dow and well below the 28% that the 20 non-Dogs returned. The biggest winner in the Dogs in 2019 was JP Morgan (JPM) with a gain of 47.27%, but Pfizer's (PFE) decline of 6.92% really hurt overall performance.

> The 20 non-Dogs were led by Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Visa (V), and United Tech (UTX), while Walgreens Boots (WBA) and 3M (MMM) were the two non-Dogs that fell in 2019.

> Moving on to 2020, below is a list of this year's Dogs of the Dow. Eight of the ten Dogs from 2019 remain on the list, while 3M (MMM) and Walgreens Boots (WBA) -- the two non-Dogs that fell in 2019 -- have replaced JP Morgan (JPM) and Procter & Gamble (PG) -- the two biggest gainers of the Dogs in 2019. Dow Inc. (DOW) is the highest yielding Dog at 5.12%, followed by Exxon (XOM), IBM, and Verizon (VZ), which all have dividend yields above 4%.

# Full Year 2019, Q4, and December Asset Class Total Returns

> Below are the final total return performance numbers for key ETFs across asset classes in 2019. For each ETF, we also include its performance in Q4 and December.

> The S&P 500 rallied 2.9% in December and 8.99% in Q4 to finish the full year up 31.22%. The Tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) was by far the best performing US index ETF in 2019 with a gain of 38.96%, and it was the third best ETF in the entire matrix. The title of best performing ETF in 2019 goes to the S&P 500 Technology sector ETF (XLK), which rallied 49.86%. Remember, 40% of XLK is made up of just Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT), which gained 89% and 58% in 2019, respectively. The Russia stock market ETF (RSX) was the second biggest winner in the matrix with a 2019 total return of 40.79%.

> Everywhere you look across the equity landscape, there were big winners in 2019, but the weakest area of the market was the Energy sector ETF (XLE). Even still, XLE managed to put up double-digit percentage gains on the year at +11.74%.

> In the commodities space, we saw oil gain 32.61% in 2019, which actually bested the gain for the S&P 500. Gold (GLD) and silver (SLV) both put in solid gains in the mid-teens, while the perpetually losing natural gas ETF (UNG) was the only ticker in the matrix that fell across all three time frames (December, Q4, and full year).

> Looking at fixed income, the aggregate bond market ETFs (AGG and BND) posted total returns of 8%+, while the 20+ Year Treasury ETF (TLT) gained 14% on the year. Q4 and December were tough for fixed income, however, as rates moved higher.

# January Almanac: Average Performance Slips in Presidential Election Years

> January has quite a reputation on Wall Street as an influx of cash from yearend bonuses and annual allocations typically propels stocks higher. January ranks #1 for NASDAQ (since 1971), but fifth on the S&P 500 and sixth for DJIA since 1950. It is the end of the best three-month span and holds a full docket of indicators and seasonalities.

> DJIA and S&P rankings did slip from 2000 to 2016 as both indices suffered losses in ten of those seventeen Januarys with three in a row, 2008, 2009 and 2010 and then again in 2014 to 2016. January 2009 has the dubious honor of being the worst January on record for DJIA (-8.8%) and S&P 500 (-8.6%) since 1901 and 1931 respectively. Last year, January was downright stellar after the worst December since 1931 for DJIA and S&P 500.

> In election years, Januarys have been weaker. DJIA and S&P 500 slip to number #8 while DJIA average performance dips negative. NASDAQ slips to #3, but average performance remains respectable at 1.7%.

#Trading Update

 * Market update – stocks are generally trading well so far Tues morning although gains in
Eurozone equities and US futures are relatively mild. News overnight was mixed – Macron is
being called the “winner” of the French presidential debate (from Mon night) and that is
giving a bid to the EUR. However, the head of the House Freedom Caucus continues to think
that Ryan’s bill won’t make it out of the Senate. Eco, monetary, and co-specific news was
pretty quiet in the last 12 hours (UK CPI firmed more than expected). Ranking the major
market segments, EM sentiment continues to quietly improve (note that the EEM ETF ended
Mon up ~1.25%) and people are feeling better about Europe too while the US outlook is
turning neutral (due to fuller valuations, a more advanced monetary policy normalization
process, and slower progress in Washington).
 * Calendar - for Tues 3/21 the focus will be on some Fed speakers (Dudley, George, Mester),
Thy God-Emperor Trump’s meeting w/Republican lawmakers (he will make a final sales pitch ahead of the
Thurs vote in the House (http://politi.co/2nWWJSH), analyst meetings (ALLY, MAR, MDRX,
and TEN), and earnings (GIS, LE, and LEN pre-open and FDX and NKE after the close).
 * Europe – the major Eurozone indices are up ~5-25bp. Industrials, basic resources, consumer
staples, tech, and healthcare are lagging while autos, fin services, banks, insurance, media,
and energy are outperforming. The SX7P bank index is the top sub-group in Europe. Akzo
Nobel is rallying after Bloomberg reported on a new bid from PPG. Fingerprint Cards is
collapsing ~30% after issuing a large profit warning. Swiss Feb watch exports were soft,
falling 10% (the largest drop in four months per Bloomberg).
 * FX – the DXY firmed ~10bp on Mon but is back in the red so far Tues morning (down ~50bp).
The FOMC decision continues to reverberate and act as a USD headwind. The EUR is rallying
following the Macron victory Mon night in the French presidential debate. The GBP had a
bid for most of the morning and extended those gains after the UK inflation numbers hit (at
5:30amET). The JPY is flattish vs. the USD.
 * Treasuries – TSYs are trading off small following the Mon rally. 2yr yields are about
unchanged while 5, 10, and 30yr yields are up ~2bp.
 * Asia – stocks saw mixed price action in Asia: Japan (TPX -0.16%, NKY -0.34%), HK (Hang Seng
+0.37%, HSCEI +0.57%), mainland China (SHCOMP +0.33%, Shenzhen +0.39%, CSI 300
+0.49%), Taiwan (TAIEX +0.6%), Korea (KOSPI +0.99%), Australia (ASX 200 -0.07%), and India
(down 15-20bp for the major indices). Japan re-opened after being closed Mon for a
holiday. Major news was generally minimal out of Asia. South Korea was the top market
w/a ~1% rally for the KOSPI. Hyundai Motor jumped 8.6% amid speculation the parent
company could undergo an ownership restructuring (per Reuters). Other top gainers
included Samsung Electronics (+1.58% - JPMorgan was out pos. on the stock), NAVER
(+6.48%), LG Chem (+4.24%), LG Display (+3.03%), and Kia Motors (+3.51%). Large-cap tech
stocks generally traded well in Taiwan – TSMC +1.83%, Largan +1.91%, MediaTek +1.77%,
Pegatron +2.56%, etc. HSI finished up +0.37% for the 4th consecutive session led by high
cyclicals CH Property +3.55%, CH Rails +2.6% and infrastructure +0.9%. Macau-linked stocks
saw some profit taking. Hengan slumped ~6.6% after neg. earnings news. Japan was
weighed down in large part by financials (down 1.17%) but also telecoms and energy.
Toshiba was the top NKY stock (up 3.37%) following reports suggesting the co was seeking
bankruptcy financing for its Westinghouse unit.
 * US macro update - at this point Ryan will likely be able to secure passage for his bill
although that is by no means a given (he continues to face opposition from both moderates
and conservatives and the head of the Freedom Caucus continues to think it won’t pass
http://bit.ly/2n301EG). Regardless, whatever comes out of the House is unlikely to make it
through the Senate. Should Ryan’s bill fail to pass the House that would deliver a major
blow to his Speakership and the White House (and would likely be a momentary market
negative) although it could spur a pivot away from healthcare and towards taxes (the SPX
will struggle to materially come for sale so long as investors have faith in a tax bill and
market patience on this subject could last for a few more weeks at least. However, if by
mid-Apr HC remains deadlocked w/no substantive tax progress doubts will grow and that
could easily erase the post-“phenomenal” rally, taking the SPX back to <2300).

#Top Headlines for Tuesday

 * Economic data/monetary policy – there wasn’t anything major out Mon night/Tues
morning. The RBA minutes were relatively uneventful. Dudley spoke Tues morning but
focused on bank culture (not policy). The UK inflation data has hawkish implications – CPI
+0.7% M/M (vs. the St +0.5%) and RPI +1.1% M/M (vs. the St +0.8%).
 * Company-specific news update for Tues morning. There weren’t too many major
headlines. Akzo Nobel is rallying after Bloomberg reported on a new bid from PPG.
Fingerprint Cards is collapsing ~30% after issuing a large profit warning. Swiss Feb watch
exports were soft, falling 10% (the largest drop in four months per Bloomberg). Toshiba
rallied ~3% in Japan following reports of it seeking bankruptcy financing for its
Westinghouse unit. Hyundai Motor jumped ~8.6% in Korea amid speculation that its parent
company could reorganize its ownership structure (per Reuters). Ant Financial is
considering a new bid for MGI according to Bloomberg (that headline hit during Mon
trading).
 * French elections – Macron seen as winner of first debate – the first poll made after the
Mon debate suggests that Macron realized the best performance, with 29% of respondents
saying he was most convincing (source: Elabe). This number drops to 19-20% for Fillon, Le
Pen, and Melenchon, and 11% for Hamon. Raphael Brun-Aguerre http://bit.ly/2nhxayl
o Italy - Italy's 5-Star builds strong lead over Renzi's PD in polls – Reuters
http://reut.rs/2nNejsR
 * Healthcare – House Republicans unveiled changes to the Ryan healthcare bill late Mon night
aimed at securing enough votes to ensure passage on Thurs. Ryan appeared to overcome a
major potential obstacle after the House Freedom Caucus failed to take a formal stand
against the bill. Republicans expressed confidence in passing the legislation on Thurs.
Washington Post http://wapo.st/2nNe692
 ** Healthcare – Ryan’s bill won’t pass House says Freedom Caucus chair – the
chairman of the Freedom Caucus says he is done negotiating w/the White House
and predicted that Ryan’s bill won’t pass the House on Thurs. The Hill
http://bit.ly/2n301EG
 ** Healthcare – 2 things to keep in keep in mind: 1) the theory that Thy God-Emperor Trump/Ryan don’t
necessarily want their healthcare bill to fail or are at least indifferent to its fate as
they would rather move on to other parts of the agenda like taxes but needed to at
least attempt repeal/replace for political reasons (this was the subject of a recent
Vox article http://bit.ly/2lNRJmC); 2) Boehner’s comments from back in Feb about
healthcare - ""In the 25 years that I served in the United States Congress, Republicans
never, ever, one time agreed on what a health care proposal should look like. Not
once….and all this happy talk that went on in November and December and January
about repeal, repeal, repeal—I started laughing” (http://politi.co/2lP9i4L).
 * Drug prices –Thy God-Emperor Trump spoke Mon night and said he wants to add a provision to Ryan’s bill that
would lower prescription drug costs through a “competitive bidding process” – Reuters
http://bit.ly/2n8Og1a
 * Thy God-Emperor Trump/Congress/Russia – the WSJ discusses how disclosure of an FBI probe into alleged
links between Russia and members of the Thy God-Emperor Trump campaign, along w/refutations of Thy God-Emperor Trump’s
wiretapping claims, could politically harm the White House and endanger the upcoming
healthcare vote. Even before the Mon hearing Thy God-Emperor Trump’s approval ratings were plumbing
unprecedented territory. WSJ. http://on.wsj.com/2nXQ4az

 ** Thy God-Emperor Trump Still Hasn't Done Very Much – Politico http://politi.co/2ndVQYK
 * North Korea – the Thy God-Emperor Trump administration is considering sweeping sanctions against North
Korea w/the aim of cutting the country off from the global financial system – Reuters
http://reut.rs/2n30GWm
 * North Korea – the head of the IAEA expressed alarm at NK’s expanding nuclear capacity and
was skeptical about the potential for an Iran-like nuclear deal – WSJ.
http://on.wsj.com/2n8JksT
 * Bank underperformance continues as yield headwind builds - the BKX slipped ~1.2% Mon
to multi-week lows and is now down ~5% off its recent highs (vs. the SPX ~1% from its ~2400
high). The index is sitting on the 50day MA, a level it hasn’t been materially below since
June/Jul. Rising yields had been one of the main bank virtues for months and helped attract
a lot of generalist money into the group. However, Treasuries are increasingly acting as a
headwind and that will remain the case until yields begin rising again in conjunction w/curve
steepening (it will likely require an acceleration in nominal growth and/or a hawkish
recalibration in FOMC expectations for TSYs to begin weakening and neither appears
probable in the near-term). This week is busy w/Fed speakers (Yellen speaks Thurs 3/23)
and the Mar flash manufacturing PMIs hit Fri 3/24 but the next big financial catalyst is still a
few weeks away (the CQ1 earnings season kicks off Thurs morning 4/13). On the regulatory
front it isn’t do much that banks (the large ones at least) anticipate (or even want) dramatic
Dodd-Frank revisions but instead it is the potential for an easier stress test process (and thus
higher capital returns) that is exciting investors. The fate of stress tests will be dependent
on Thy God-Emperor Trump’s Fed picks (which the market is still waiting to see).
 * Brexit/banks – big investment banks will commence the process of moving some Londonbased
operations inside the EU within weeks of PM May triggering Article 50 – Bloomberg
http://bloom.bg/2nhveGc
 * US labor market not as tight as the headline UR makes it appear according to a new San
Francisco Fed paper (this hit during trading on Mon) – “the U.S. unemployment rate fell to
a very low level at the end of 2016, raising the question of whether the labor market has
become too tight. After applying a new method to adjust for demographic changes in the
labor force, the current unemployment rate is still 0.3 to 0.4 percentage point higher than
at past labor market peaks. This indicates that the labor market may not be quite as tight
as the headline unemployment rate suggests”. http://bit.ly/2nfmrVo
 * Autos are emerging as a key source of trade contention between China and the US
according to the NYT in an article out Mon afternoon (http://nyti.ms/2n725x0) – China
imposes enormous taxes on autos imported into the country and this is something the
White House could target during upcoming talks between Thy God-Emperor Trump and Xi (the two are
scheduled to meet Apr 6-7 in Florida). The China/US autos rift was reported over the
weekend by Axios (http://bit.ly/2mKkDAt). Chinese auto OEMs and parts manufacturers
could build more US plants to help ease the trade tensions.

#US – healthcare

 * Healthcare – House Republicans unveiled changes to the Ryan healthcare bill late Mon night
aimed at securing enough votes to ensure passage on Thurs. Ryan appeared to overcome a
major potential obstacle after the House Freedom Caucus failed to take a formal stand
against the bill. Republicans expressed confidence in passing the legislation on Thurs.
Washington Post http://wapo.st/2nNe692
o Healthcare – Ryan’s bill won’t pass House says Freedom Caucus chair – the
chairman of the Freedom Caucus says he is done negotiating w/the White House
and predicted that Ryan’s bill won’t pass the House on Thurs. The Hill
http://bit.ly/2n301EG
o Healthcare – 2 things to keep in keep in mind: 1) the theory that Thy God-Emperor Trump/Ryan don’t
necessarily want their healthcare bill to fail or are at least indifferent to its fate as
they would rather move on to other parts of the agenda like taxes but needed to at
least attempt repeal/replace for political reasons (this was the subject of a recent
Vox article http://bit.ly/2lNRJmC); 2) Boehner’s comments from back in Feb about
healthcare - ""In the 25 years that I served in the United States Congress, Republicans
never, ever, one time agreed on what a health care proposal should look like. Not
once….and all this happy talk that went on in November and December and January
about repeal, repeal, repeal—I started laughing” (http://politi.co/2lP9i4L).
 * Drug prices –Thy God-Emperor Trump spoke Mon night and said he wants to add a provision to Ryan’s bill that
would lower prescription drug costs through a “competitive bidding process” – Reuters
http://bit.ly/2n8Og1a
 * House Republicans to set up a media “spin room” ahead of the Thurs healthcare vote;
“spin rooms” are usually employed during campaigns and will help the GOP answer
questions and respond to criticisms – The Hill http://bit.ly/2nLmfLi

 * Auto financing – falling used car prices a neg. for auto finance companies – WSJ.
http://on.wsj.com/2mPqPr1
 * Bank underperformance continues as yield headwind builds - the BKX slipped ~1.2% Mon
to multi-week lows and is now down ~5% off its recent highs (vs. the SPX ~1% from its ~2400
high). The index is sitting on the 50day MA, a level it hasn’t been materially below since
June/Jul. Rising yields had been one of the main bank virtues for months and helped attract
a lot of generalist money into the group. However, Treasuries are increasingly acting as a
headwind and that will remain the case until yields begin rising again in conjunction w/curve
steepening (it will likely require an acceleration in nominal growth and/or a hawkish
recalibration in FOMC expectations for TSYs to begin weakening and neither appears
probable in the near-term). This week is busy w/Fed speakers (Yellen speaks Thurs 3/23)
and the Mar flash manufacturing PMIs hit Fri 3/24 but the next big financial catalyst is still a
few weeks away (the CQ1 earnings season kicks off Thurs morning 4/13). On the regulatory
front it isn’t do much that banks (the large ones at least) anticipate (or even want) dramatic
Dodd-Frank revisions but instead it is the potential for an easier stress test process (and thus
higher capital returns) that is exciting investors. The fate of stress tests will be dependent

Rite Aid ( RAD ) Remains on Track Despite Projected Q4 EBITDA Miss,27,mml1a6,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mml1a6/rite_aid_rad_remains_on_track_despite_projected/,20,2021-04-08 11:11:08,"**Rite Aid Remains on Track Despite Projected Q4 EBITDA Miss**

(by **The Sound of Money** as seen on **Seeking Alpha** on April 7, 2021)

***Management Updates Guidance***

On March 25, 2021, Rite Aid provided updated guidance for the 2021 fiscal year that closed on February 27, 2021. In that guidance, Rite Aid indicated the following:

· Full year revenue of approximately $24 billion (on target with guidance of $23.9 - $24.2 billion provided on December 17, 2020).

· Fully year net loss of $90 to $100 million (in line with guidance of $89 - $114 million provided back on December 17, 2020)

· Full year adjusted EBITDA of $425 - $435 million representing a miss of $65 - $85 million versus the December 17, 2020 guidance.

The adjusted EBITDA miss caused RAD shares to tank more than 20% and settle below $19 per share. But was that price reaction in the stock warranted?

***Deutsche Bank Raises Price Target on RAD***

The following day on March 25, 2021, despite the blow that had been dealt to RAD shares by the market, Deutsche Bank raised its price target on Rite Aid to $27 from $17 and added the stock to its “Catalyst Call Buy Idea” list. What could be behind this vastly divergent view held by Deutsche Bank compared to that of the general consensus on Wall Street?

***The Q4 COVID Effect***

The EBITDA hit taken by Rite Aid during Q4 of the company’s 2021 fiscal year was directly related to a unique, non-repeating event, namely the explosion in spread of COVID-19 infections that took place throughout that 90-day period. The spike in USA COVID-19 cases was centered directly in Rite Aid’s Q4 which ran during the months of December 2020 to February 2021. During Rite Aid’s fiscal 4th quarter, much of the nation was on lockdown mode. Visits to retail stores were less frequent, and acute prescriptions were down. Most devastating to Rite Aid’s profitability during the quarter was the fact that precautions taken to avoid COVID-19 spread, also dramatically reduced the incidence of common cold and flu.

Rite Aid’s 4th quarter EBITDA miss is a one-off, COVID-19 related event that is now in the rearview mirror. Looking ahead, there are significant tailwinds that should bolster the company’s financial performance in the 2022 fiscal year which began on February 28, 2021.

***The Re-Opening Trade***

In addition to the updated guidance provided by Rite Aid on March 25, 2021, the company gave some insight into the start of the new fiscal year (2022) that began on February 28, 2021:

*""Looking ahead, we have seen acute prescriptions return to positive levels in March…”* – Heyward Donigan, CEO, Rite Aid

In the first quarter of the prior (2021) fiscal year, Rite Aid saw a year-over-year decline in acute prescriptions of 14.8% resulting from the postponement of outpatient medical visits and elective surgical procedures related to the coronavirus pandemic. The prior year decline in acute prescriptions contributed to a 2.6% decline in adjusted EBITDA during the first quarter of fiscal 2021. The decline in Rite Aid’s acute prescription sales continued throughout the first half of fiscal 2021, with a drop of 4.9% in that year’s second quarter. However, with the economy re-opening, outpatient visits and elective surgical procedures have now largely returned to normalized levels, as is indicated by Rite Aid’s report of a positive trend in acute prescriptions during the first month of the new fiscal year, 2022. As a result, Rite Aid should see a significant increase in year-over-year acute prescriptions which should contribute to an increase in adjusted EBITDA during the first half of the current fiscal year. As well, with the COVID-19 lockdown now concluded in the USA, it can be reasonably expected that visits to local drug stores will increase relative to the first half of the prior year, with a broader range of products being purchased by consumers beyond just cleaning products and disinfectants. As such, front-end retail store revenues will likely see a year-over-year boost, adding further to improved adjusted EBITDA results.

***Impact of Coronavirus Vaccinations***

Another significant contributor to Rite Aid’s improvement in first half fiscal 2022 results will be the coronavirus vaccine distribution program. Rite Aid is an official participant in the US government’s Federal Retail Pharmacy Program for COVID-19 Vaccination. Recently, the US government dramatically increased the reimbursement rates for pharmacies administering the coronavirus vaccine to $40 from $28 for a single dose. Within Rite Aid’s updated guidance announcement issued on March 25, 2021, Rite Aid CEO, Heyward Donigan remarked:

*“…we are proud to be selected as one of the retail providers administering COVID vaccines in the majority of our key states and cities, representing over 1,800 of our stores. We are significantly ramping up the number of vaccines we are administering on a daily basis, and have administered approximately 1 million COVID vaccines in March to date.”*

At the rate of vaccination indicated by this statement above, it is fair to estimate that Rite Aid will administer approximately six (6) million doses of COVID-19 vaccine during the first half of its 2022 fiscal year. Using the government reimbursement rates, the six (6) million doses will likely generate $230 million in revenue for Rite Aid and contribute approximately $2 per share in net profits. While the initial vaccination program will likely be completed during Rite Aid’s fiscal first half, the COVID-19 vaccine boosters are likely to become an annual revenue / profit stream for Rite Aid, as the annual flu vaccine is today. The latest view from epidemiologists suggests that annual coronavirus booster shots will likely be required on an annual basis. The global spread of coronavirus variants such as the E484K mutation lend credence to this view. Furthermore, customers visiting their local Rite Aid for COVID-19 vaccinations and boosters will become aware and take advantage of the fact that the retailer also offers nineteen (19) other vaccines, including flu, pneumonia, chicken pox, HPV, hepatitis A & B, and meningitis among others. As a result, vaccine distribution will continue to play a role in Rite Aids retail pharmacy growth story.

***Second Half of Fiscal 2022 Will See Benefits from Cold / Flu Season***

Rite Aid’s 2nd half of fiscal year 2021 saw earnings take a significant hit due to the weak cold and flu season during the coronavirus pandemic lockdown. However, experts are concerned that the upcoming cold and flu season could by dramatically worse. As face-to-face interaction between people returns as a result of the end of the lockdown, there will be far greater spread in the USA of virus that cause cold and flu. Also, as a result of last season’s reduced flu level, there exists little data for utilization in the development of the upcoming seasons flu shots. With little data available to scientists, the 2021 – 2022 flu shots may not be highly effective at preventing the flu. On a relative basis, Rite Aid is likely to see much higher year-over-year revenue and profits in the second half of the fiscal 2022 (September 2021 through February 2022) related to cold and flu remedies.

***Long-Term Debt Remains a Downside Risk***

The long-term debt level remains a concern for Rite Aid. As of the Q3 earnings report, the company indicated that debt stood at $3.2 billion. The interest level required to service this debt amounts to approximately $200 million per year, which is a drag on earnings to the tune of approximately $3.65 per share. Thus far, Rite Aid has demonstrated that it is capable of servicing this debt level successfully, and it expected to report positive free cash flow for the full year fiscal 2021. However, if there is an unexpected downturn in the economy or Rite Aid’s performance, the long-term debt could put the company’s financial future in jeopardy.

***The Author’s Estimate of Rite Aid’s Fiscal 2022 Forward Guidance***

Based on the assumptions noted above, I have calculated an estimate of Rite Aid’s forward-looking guidance for the company’s fiscal year 2022. My figures for Rite Aid’s financial outlook for the current fiscal year are as follows:

**FISCAL YEAR 2022 PROJECTIONS (BASED ON THE AUTHOR'S ESTIMATES)**

**Total Revenues: $24.9B - $25.2B**

**Same Store Sales: 4.0% - 5.0%**

**Adjusted EBITDA: $590M - $620M**

**Net Gain: $6M - $31M**

**Adjusted net income per share: $2.45 - $2.85**

**Capital Expenditures: \~$225M**

**Free Cash Flow: $170M - $220M**

***Conclusion***

Rite Aid’s financial performance for fiscal year 2021 was negatively impacted by COVID-19, primarily due to a reduction in acute prescriptions and low sales of cold and flu treatments. During the current fiscal year (2022), the company is likely to see a strong revenue and profit improvement as it benefits from tailwinds created by normalized demand for acute prescriptions, cold and flu remedies, and the boost provided from reimbursements for COVID-19 vaccine administration. Vaccine administration is likely to benefit Rite Aid in the long-term, providing a growing revenue and profit stream for the company."

Aug 8th 2018 Failed Merger of Albertsons and RAD due to shareholder concerns of undervalued deal- Unfinished business?

July 27th 2019 Amazon launched flagship “Counter” Service with RAD the first of its kind.

May 20th 2020 Apollo Global Management paid 1.75Billion for 17.5% Stake in Boise based Albertsons IPO

Aug 5th 2020 Rite Aid names Paul Gilbert General Counsel after Mr. Gilbert assisted RAD as a legal facilitator starting May 21st 2020. Mr Gilbert assisted with the company’s virtual annual shareholders meeting via Law Firm Epstein, Becker & Green. While working at the firm Mr. Gilbert was a healthcare partner working mostly PE Investments. Prior to that he served 10 years at LifePoint Health who was acquired by APO shortly after his departure.

AMZ and APO have business relationships in other endeavors such as Sun Country Airlines. Amazon just announced brick and mortar pharmacy desires.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 28th, 2019.

# **The Fed and Apple earnings will make or break market’s return to record highs in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/25/the-fed-could-be-what-makes-or-breaks-the-stock-markets-push-into-record-territory.html)**
*****
> Stocks will try in the week ahead to break the all-time highs set earlier in the year as a slew of S&P 500 companies get set to report.
*****
> Stock prices are bumping up against their highs, but whether they can burst through and hold gains may, for the near term, depend on what investors hear from Jerome Powell in the week ahead.
*****
> In a week stacked with major events, the Fed’s two-day meeting is likely to be the high point. The Federal Open Market Committee is expected to make its third quarter point interest rate cut Wednesday afternoon, followed by comments form Fed Chairman Powell. Those comments could be his most important message of the next few months, as investors watch to see whether he holds the door open to future rate cuts, or signals it’s time to pause, as some economists expect.
*****
> “Our view is they’ll be done after this. We’re not expecting a cut in December, and we’re not expecting cuts next year. The economy, in my mind, looks like it’s stabilizing, and there should be more evidence of that in the next couple of weeks. focusing on the labor market is the key thing,” said Drew Matus, chief market strategist at MetLife Investment Management. If the labor market holds up, expectations for rate cuts should decline. “I do think the dissenters are arguing they shouldn’t be cutting at all.”
*****
> But Matus’ view is just one of many on Wall Street. Some economists expect another cut in December, while others expect one or more cuts next year, depending on how they view the economy. Goldman Sachs economists laid out a case where the Fed will clearly signal that it plans to pause after Wednesday.
*****
> All of this could make for volatility in stocks and bonds, depending on which market view prevails in Powell’s comments. “It’s going to be choppy going into the Fed,” said Andrew Brenner of National Alliance. In the past week, yields were higher with the 10-year Treasury yield touching 1.8% Friday.
*****
> The S&P 500 was up 1.2% for the week, ending at 3,022, just below its closing high. On Friday, it briefly traded above the July 26 high of 3,025. The Dow ended the week with a gain of 0.7%, at 26,956, and it remains about 1% below its closing high.
*****
> In addition, the earnings calendar remains heavy with about 145 S&P 500 companies releasing earnings, including Alphabet Monday and big oil Exxon Mobil and Chevron Friday. On Wednesday, earnings are expected from Apple, which is setting new highs of its own.
*****
> # Big economic reports

> On top of that, November kicks off Friday in what looks to be the most important day for economic data of the new month. Besides the critical monthly employment report, there is the key ISM manufacturing report, expected to show a contraction in manufacturing activity for a third month.
*****
> Both reports could be distorted by the GM strike, which is expected to result in an October employment report with fewer than 100,000 jobs. According to Refinitiv, total non farm payrolls are expected to be 90,000, while manufacturing jobs are expected to decline by 50,000. That would include the impact of GM workers, but also the employees of the many suppliers and services that support the car company’s manufacturing operations.
*****
> “The jobs number will be big, but the ISM could be bigger. If that turns up, like Markit [PMI] suggested, that could be a big deal,” said Leuthold Group Chief Investment Strategist James Paulsen. On Thursday, Markit flash PMI manufacturing data for October was higher than expected, and still has not shown a contraction.
*****
> “If it turns up, I think that’s to affect a lot of people and how they feel about things. That could take on a whole new dimension of what happens to Wall Street earnings estimates,” he said.
*****
> Manufacturing data has dragged, due to the impact of tariffs and the trade war, and some big companies have taken a hit as a result, like Caterpillar which on Wednesday reported weaker than expected earnings and sales. Caterpillar also cut its outlook, in large part due to weakness in China. Caterpillar shares were slammed but on Friday, the stock was bouncing back by 3.5%.
*****
> # Stocks at ‘inflection point’

> Quincy Krosby, Prudential Financial’s chief market strategist, said the fact Caterpillar was able to come back at the end of the week was a positive for the market, which she says is now entering the late year seasonal period where stocks typically do well. At the same time, she said news for the market looks like it’s about to get “less bad.”
*****
> ″″Less bad’ is not a full fledged agreement with China. Less bad is a truce. It means that Dec. 15 extension in tariffs does not happen,” she said, adding the market appears to be at an inflection point with investors expecting an agreement of some type between President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping when they meet in November.
*****
> ″‘I’m not bullish. I’m not bearish. I’m optimistic. This market has been led by the defensive sectors. You’re starting to see that move into consumer discretionary. It’s telling you the market is seeing growth, albeit it not stellar growth, but when it gets ‘less bad’ you’re going to see that it’s being reflected in this inflection point in the market,” said said. “We’re seeing a move more and more into the cyclical and growth sectors, and by the way, we’re seeing a steepening of the yield curve.”
*****
> The yield curve represents the difference between the yields of two different duration Treasury securities. When the curve inverts, the yield on the shorter duration security, in this case the 2-year has become higher than that of say, the 10-year. That is one part of the curve that was temporarily inverted, and if it stayed inverted it would be a recession warning.
*****
> The 10-year has been moving higher, and the 1.80% level will be important if the yield can stay above it.
*****
> “If it pushes through 1.80, you’re going to take the inversion out, by the bond market, not the Fed,” Paulsen said. Paulsen said it would be a sign of confidence in the economy if yields can push higher.
*****
> The Fed taking a pause may add to that sense. “I think most people think one more cut and done,” he said. “The bigger news will be what [Powell] says in that press conference. He can go pretty off script sometimes.”
*****
> # ‘Greater optimsim’ in market

> Paulsen said stocks could be in a good period, and earnings news seems to be already priced in. “The data by and large has been okay. You have earnings that are okay, and there’s no sense of imminent recession. It just seems there’s greater optimism,” he said.
*****
> Of the approximately 200 S&P companies that reported by Friday morning, more than 78% have beaten on earnings per share, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv. Earnings are expected to decline by 2% for the third quarter, based on estimates and results from companies that already reported.
*****
> Paulsen said there’s some sense in the market that Brexit will not end in a worst case scenario, but it is something to watch in the week ahead as British lawmakers decide whether to hold an election.
*****
> Jack Ablin, chief investment officer with Cresset Wealth Advisors, said he thinks Brexit would be a bigger deal than the trade agreement for the world economy, if it goes poorly, with the U.K. leaving the European Union with no deal. “A no deal Brexit is likely to take 2 percentage points off of British growth...It would take 1% off European growth...I think that’s significant,” Ablin said. “I think investors are underplaying it because it’s so binary. It’s hard to position for a binary outcome. If we get some resolution there, to me, that has the biggest impact for the markets.”

> Many refer to our Best Six Months Tactical Seasonal Switching Strategy as the Halloween Indicator or Halloween Strategy and of course “Sell in May”. These catch phrases highlight our discovery that was first published in 1986 in the 1987 Stock Trader’s Almanac that most of the market’s gains are made from October 31 to April 30, while the market goes sideways to down from May through October.

> Since 1950 DJIA is up 7.5% November-April and up only 0.6% May-October. We encouraged folks not to fear Octoberphobia early this month and wait for our MACD Buy Signal which came on October 11. We have been positioning more bullishly since in sector and major U.S. market ETFs and with a new basket of stocks. But the next seven days have been a historically bullish trade.

# Normally a top month, November has been lackluster in Pre-Election Years

> November maintains its status among the top performing months as fourth-quarter cash inflows from institutions drive November to lead the best consecutive three-month span November-January. However, the month has taken hits during bear markets and November 2000, down –22.9% (undecided election and a nascent bear), was NASDAQ’s second worst month on record—only October 1987 was worse.

> November begins the “Best Six Months” for the DJIA and S&P 500, and the “Best Eight Months” for NASDAQ. Small caps come into favor during November, but don’t really take off until the last two weeks of the year. November is the number-two DJIA (since 1950), NASDAQ (since 1971) and Russell 2000 (since 1979) month. November is best for S&P 500 (since 1950) and Russell 1000’s (since 1979).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ef59a01a84a6391160b8624e5d05acf0/795865009b4c2002-94/s400x600/2d11d5ae114446e6162b685da1210ec1c8e83e73.jpg))**

> In pre-election years, November’s performance is noticeably weaker. DJIA has advanced in nine of the last 17 pre-election years since 1950 with an average gain of 0.3%. S&P 500 has been up in 10 of the past 17 pre-election years, also gaining on average a rather paltry 0.3%. Small-caps and techs perform better with Russell 2000 climbing in 6 of the past 10 pre-election years, averaging 1.2%. NASDAQ has been up in 7 of the last 12 pre-election year Novembers with an average 0.9% gain. Contributing to pre-election year November’s weaker performance are nasty declines in 1987, 1991 and 2007.

# Q4 Rally Is Real. Don’t Let 2018 Spook You

> Understandably folks are apprehensive about the perennial fourth quarter rally this year after the debacle that culminated in the Christmas Eve Crumble in 2018. But the history is clear. The fourth quarter is the best quarter of the year going back to 1949, except for NASDAQ where Q1 leads Q4 by 4.5% to 4.0%, since 1971.

> Historically, the “Sweet Spot” of the 4-Year Election Cycle is the three-quarter span from Q4 Midterm Year through Q2 Pre-Election Year, averaging a gain of 19.3% for DJIA and 20.0% for S&P 500 since 1949 and 29.3% for NASDAQ since 1971. Conversely the weakest two-quarter span is Q2-Q3 of the Midterm Year, averaging a loss of -1.2% for DJIA and -1.5% for S&P 500 since 1949 and -5.0% for NASDAQ since 1971.

> Market action was impacted by some more powerful forces in 2018 that trumped (no pun intended) seasonality. Q2-Q3 was up 9.8% for DJIA, 10.3% for S&P and 13.9% for NASDAQ. Q4 was horrible, down -11.8% for DJIA, -14.0% for S&P and -17.5% for NASDAQ.Q1-Q2 of pre-election year, especially Q1 gained all that back.

> Pre-Election year Q4 is still one of the best quarters of the 4-Year Cycle, ranked 5th, for average gains of 2.6% for DJIA and 3.2% for S&P since 1949 and 5.4% for NASDAQ. Additionally, from the Pre-Election Seasonal Pattern we updated in last Friday’s post, you can see how the market tends to make a high near yearend in the Pre-Election Year. So, save some new unexpected outside event, Q4 Market Magic is expected to impress once again this year.

# 2019 May Be One of the Best Years Ever

> “Everything is awesome, when you’re living out a dream.” The Lego Movie

> As the S&P 500 Index continues to flirt with new record highs, something under the surface is taking place that is making 2019 extremely special. Or dare we say, “awesome”.

> First, let’s look back at last year. 2018 was the first year since 1969 in which both the S&P 500 (stocks) and the 10-year Treasury bond (bonds) both finished the year with a negative return. Toss in the fact that gold and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil were both down last year, and it was one of the worst years ever for a diversified portfolio.

> “As bad as last year was for investors, 2019 is a mirror image, with stocks, bonds, gold, and crude oil all potentially finishing the year up double digits for the first time in history,” explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, it has been a great year for stocks, bonds, gold, and crude oil. Of course, there are still more than two months to go in 2019, but this year is shaping up to be one of the best years ever for these four important assets.

# An Early Look at Earnings

> We're now in the thick of the Q3 earnings reporting period with 130 companies reporting since just the close last night. As shown in our Earnings Explorer snapshot below, earnings will be in overdrive for the next two weeks before dying down in mid-November.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/explorer.png))**

> Through yesterday's close, 248 companies had reported so far this season, and 75% of them had beaten consensus bottom-line EPS estimates. However, just 63% of stocks have beaten sales estimates, and more companies have lowered guidance than raised guidance. In terms of stock price reaction to reports this season, so far investors have seen earnings as relatively bullish as the average stock that has reported has gained 0.60% on its earnings reaction day. Below we show another snapshot from our Earnings Explorer featuring the aggregate results of this season's reports and a list of the stocks that have reacted the most positively to earnings. Four stocks so far have gained more than 20% on their earnings reaction days -- PETS, BIIB, APHA, and LLNW.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/epsstats.png))**

> We provide clients with a beat-rate monitor on our Earnings Explorer page as well. Below is a chart showing the rolling 3-month EPS and sales beat rates for US companies over the last 5 years. After a dip in the EPS beat rate earlier in the year, we've seen it steadily increase over the last few months up to its current level of 64.46%. That's more than five percentage points above the historical average of 59.37%.

> In terms of sales, 57.87% of companies have beaten top-line estimates over the last 3 months, which is much closer to the historical average than the bottom-line beat rate.

# Banks - On To The Next Test

> It has been a pretty monumental two weeks for the KBW Bank index. Since the close on 10/8, the index has rallied just under 9% as earnings reports from some of the largest US banks received a warm welcome from Wall Street. The index is now once again testing the top-end of its range, one which it has unsuccessfully tested multiple times in the last year. If you think the repeated tests of 3,000 for the S&P 500 over the last 18 months have been dramatic, the current go around with 103 for the KBW Bank Index has been the sixth such test in the last year! We would also note that prior to last year's fourth quarter downturn, the same level that has been acting as resistance for the KBW Bank index was previously providing support.

> In the case of each prior failed break above 103 for the KBW Bank index, sell-offs of at least 5% (and usually 10%+) followed, but one thing the index has going for it even if the sixth time isn't the charm is that just yesterday it broke above its downtrend that has been in place since early 2018. The group has passed one test at least! From here, if we do see a pullback, that former downtrend line should provide support.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/102319-Banks.png))**

> Turning to the KBW Index's individual components, the table below lists each of the 24 stocks in the index along with how each one has performed since the index's recent low on 10/8 and on a YTD basis (sorted by performance since 10/8). In the slightly more than two weeks since the index's short-term low, every stock in the index is up and up by at least 4%. That's a pretty broad rally!

> Leading the way to the upside, State Street (STT) has rallied nearly 20%, while First Republic (FRC), Northern Trust (NTRS), and Bank of America (BAC) have jumped more than 13%. In the case of STT, the rally of the last two-weeks has also moved the stock into the green on a YTD basis.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 12th, 2020.

# **Earnings could be a positive force for stocks as Washington continues to wrangle over stimulus  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/09/earnings-could-be-a-positive-force-for-stocks-as-washington-continues-to-wrangle-over-stimulus.html)**
*****
> Stock market optimism for a stimulus package has been rising, but the focus swings to earnings and that could be a positive for stocks in the week ahead.
*****
> JPMorgan, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley all release earnings in the first big wave of corporate reports. There is also some important data, including CPI inflation data Tuesday and retail sales for September on Friday.
*****
> “It looks like earnings season might turn out better than expected, based on early reports,” said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. “The guidance looks pretty good. So, we have earnings season upon us, the stimulus talks go back and forth, and it looks like maybe there’s a will to get something done.”
*****
> On Friday afternoon, the White House raised its offer for at stimulus package to $1.8 trillion but was still below the $2.2 trillion sought by Democrats. “It’s really hard to read,” said Keon.
*****
> But he said even if there’s no agreement on stimulus now, there should be a package after the election, regardless of who wins. 
*****
> “I actually put some money to work in small caps on the belief if we get further stimulus either soon or a few months from now, you do want to own economically sensitive stocks,” said Keon.“We’re reasonably constructive on the market and valuations are not cheap, but compared to the 10-year [Treasury yield] at less than 80 basis points, stocks don’t look that bad.”
*****
> Stocks in the past week had their best performance since early July, with the S&P 500 up 3.8% at 3,477. The small cap Russell 2000 was up 6.4%. The 10-year Treasury yield had a big move during the week from about 0.70% to as high as 0.79% Friday. Yields move opposite price, and the 10-year yield has now broken out of a range its been stuck in below 0.70%.
*****
> Earnings could provide positive momentum for stocks, if companies continue to beat estimates at a healthy pace, like last quarter.
*****
> “Q2 reporting season saw S&P 500 earnings beat at an unprecedented rate, both in terms of breadth (85%) and size (+20%), prompting historically rare, strong upgrades to forward estimates, especially for the cyclicals, and one of the strongest earnings season rallies on record,” wrote Deutsche Bank strategists.
*****
> The summer earnings rally came before the big September decline, which took the S&P 500  down about 10%. The S&P 500 is up more than 8% since Sept. 24.
*****
> “While the bottom-up consensus for Q3 is for a sharp rebound in headline earnings, the bulk of it is being driven by reductions in loan loss provisions and Energy sector losses. Excluding these, underlying earnings growth is forecast to barely move up (-15% to -13%), despite rising Q3 GDP growth estimates pointing to a strong macro rebound,” they noted.
*****
> The Deutsche strategists said the question remains, however, whether the market will respond to earnings beats or election uncertainty.
*****
> Keon said the market has been moving up as former vice president Joe Biden extended his lead in the polls because there’s less chance of an uncertain outlook the more one candidate leads. According to RealClearPolitics, he was leading President Donald Trump by 9.7 percentage points, from just about  6 points at the beginning of the prior week.
*****
> “I think from the market’s perspective, it doesn’t really matter who wins, as long as we have a clear winner,” said Keon. “I think the direction of the polls are suggesting that we’re going to have a clear winner either on election night or a few days after that. The risk of a messy contested election is going down, and the market is relieved by that.”
*****
> Tom Block, Washington analyst at Fundstrat, said Trump appears to be hoping for a stimulus bill signing before the election to help his re-election effort.
*****
> “There are many moving parts here, and they’re all moving in different directions,” said Block. “It’s not impossible a deal comes together but the pathway to a deal is not clear on Friday afternoon because of the mixed signals that have come out over the last seven days from the White House.”
*****
> Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has opposed a large package, and the two sides have been stalemated. “I think the president believes that he will be helped by having a signed ceremony at the White House approving the bill, that the optics of signing the bill that’s going to send relief to people is an optic he desperately wants, and it can’t hurt,” he said.
*****
> The economic recovery is going on in the background, and some parts of the economy have shown real improvement, like housing.
*****
> Retail sales on Friday is a good look at how the consumer has been faring, now that enhanced unemployment benefits have been gone for the past two months. Economists expect 0.6% gain in retail sales, the same as August.
*****
> Keon said it is important to get some more help for the economy through stimulus. There is expected to be one-time payments to individuals and enhanced employment benefits.
*****
> “That would be good news for the market, if we could get more help where it is needed. We really just need to get a bridge for a more normal circumstances next year,” said Keon.

> # Ten-Baggers Under Trump

> In our prior post we looked at the best and worst performing S&P 500 stocks since Election Day 2016. In this post we've broadened our filter and looked at the Russell 3,000, which is an index that covers more than 98% of all publicly traded market cap in the US. Within the Russell 3,000, there are 32 stocks that are up more than 1,000% since Trump was elected. These 32 ""ten-baggers"" -- as Peter Lynch liked to call them -- are listed in the table below.

> At the top of the list is Enphase Energy (ENPH), which is up 8,892% since Election Day 2016. While Enphase has ""Energy"" in its company name, it's actually a Technology sector stock that ""manufactures software-driven home energy solutions that span solar generation, home energy storage and web-based monitoring and control."" Next up is Zynex (ZYXI) with a gain of 7,211%, followed by Digital Turbine (APPS) up 5,320%. ZYXI markets itself as a ""better and safer way to manage pain"" than opiods using electrotherapy devices. APPS is an app marketing company that helps app developers get their product on as many devices as possible.

> Of the 16 best performing Russell 3,000 stocks since Election Day 2016, 15 come from either the Technology or Health Care sectors. XPEL is the only stock in the top ten that's not in either the Tech or Health Care sectors. Up 2,341% since Trump was elected, XPEL is a Consumer Discretionary stock whose main product is to provide auto-paint protection.

> Along with the names mentioned already, other notables on the list of ten-baggers under Trump include Jack Dorsey's Square (SQ), pet-food maker Freshpet (FRPT), digital health company Teladoc (TDOC), the arts and crafts social media company Etsy (ETSY), and of course, Tesla (TSLA). With a gain of 1,002% since November 8th, 2016, Tesla just barely makes the cut!

> # Best Performing Stocks Since Election Day 2016

> On Monday we published our asset class performance matrix showing total returns for key ETFs since Election Day 2016 (11/8/16). Today we wanted to highlight the individual stocks traded on US exchanges that have performed the best and the worst since President Trump surprised the world with a victory over Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. First off, below is a chart showing the average performance of stocks in each S&P 500 sector since Election Day 2016. (These are based on stocks currently in the index and not as the index stood on 11/8/16.)

> As shown, the average stock in the broad S&P 500 is up 67.3% since Trump was elected. Four sectors have posted stronger average returns than that -- Technology (+160.4%), Health Care (+100.3%), Consumer Discretionary (+74.6%), and Industrials (+69.9%).

> The Energy sector stands out like a sore thumb in the chart below. While every other sector has at least averaged double-digit percentage gains, the stocks in the Energy sector are down an average of 52.3% since Trump was elected! Other sectors that have been weaker than the broad market include Real Estate, Consumer Staples, and Financials.

> If you were to ask most people back in November 2016 which areas of the market should outperform under Trump and which should underperform, you'd likely see results that are the exact opposite of what has actually happened. Sectors like Energy, Real Estate, and Financials would have been expected to benefit from Trump since those are the industries he's most associated with, while Tech is a sector that's usually expected to benefit more when the Democratic party is in control.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/avgsector.png))**

> Looking at individual stocks, below we show the 46 stocks currently in the S&P 500 that are up at least 200% since Election Day 2016. Two stocks -- Etsy (ETSY) and Advanced Micro (AMD) -- have been ""10-baggers"" with gains of more than 1,000%, while another three -- Paycom (PAYC), NVIDIA (NVDA) and DexCom (DXCM) -- are up more than 500%. Other names on the list are a who's who of the most popular stocks over the past few years, including Adobe (ADBE), Netflix (NFLX), Apple (AAPL), Amazon.com (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), salesforce.com (CRM), and PayPal (PYPL).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/bestsince16.png))**

> While there are 46 stocks in the S&P 500 up more than 200% since Election Day 2016, there are 32 stocks that are down more than 50% over the same time frame. The Energy sector is the most represented on this list by far with 14 stocks overall and 10 of the worst 11! The only non-Energy stock in the top ten is General Electric (GE), which is down 76% since Trump was elected. Other notable losers include airlines and cruiselines like AAL, CCL, and NCLH, and consumer stocks like TAP, KHC, UAA, WBA, and LB.

> General Electric (GE) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) are the two names that stand out the most. Each of these stocks were at one point in time the largest company in the world, but they're both now shells of their former selves with huge losses over the last four years. Remember these two examples when you're looking at the largest companies in the world right now. Chances are a few of them will experience similar fates as GE and XOM over the next ten to twenty years.

> # News High for Net New Highs

> Yesterday, the S&P 500 closed at its highest level since only a few days after the early September high. While the index has yet to reach a new high, many individual stocks in the index have. As shown in the charts below, 11.71% of S&P 500 stocks closed at a new 52-week high yesterday while no stocks closed at a new 52-week low. That makes for the second-highest net new highs reading of the pandemic with the only higher reading (17.62%) occurring just over a month ago at the last all-time high on September 2nd. Before that, the last time net new highs were as high as now was on February 19th: the last all-time high before the bear market began.

> As for the individual sectors, there has also been a significant pickup in the net percentage of new 52-week highs. Industrials currently has the highest reading of net new highs among the 11 sectors at 26%. Just like the broader S&P 500, that is the highest since September 2nd when the net percentage of new highs rose above 30%. Consumer Discretionary is the runner up in being the sector with the highest percentage of net new highs. One distinguishing factor, though, is whereas every other sector has seen higher readings at some point since the bear market in the spring, Consumer Discretionary's current reading of 18% is tied with the reading from August 24th. On the other end of the spectrum, both Communication Services and the Energy sector have seen no new highs over the past few days. Granted, there have not been any new 52-week lows either. Meanwhile, Financials and Real Estate have both seen an uptick in net new highs, but it has been much more modest than other sectors.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100920-Net-New-Highs.png))**

*****

> # Breadth Booming

> One of the most notable aspects of the rally off the late September lows has been broad participation. As shown below, breadth is very strong as the 10-day advance-decline lines for several sectors are at some of their highest levels of the past year. For the S&P 500, the 10-day advance-decline line is at its highest level since June 8th. The same can be said for Communication Services, Consumer Discretionary, Financials, and Real Estate. For Consumer Staples, the sector's 10-day A/D line is at its highest level since June of 2019 and for Health Care it is at its highest level since May of 2019. In the case of Technology, it has been even longer as that sector's line is at its highest level since last April.

> While broad participation is healthy for the long-term prospects of a rally, these 10-Day A/D lines have gotten extremely overbought in the near term, suggesting a cool-down period is likely in the days ahead.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100820-10-day.png))**

> With short term breadth running very hot, the cumulative A/D lines of several sectors are breaking out to new highs as well. Utilities and Materials are the only sectors to have seen prices reach a new high in the past few days alongside their cumulative A/D lines. As for the other sectors, Consumer Discretionary, Consumer Staples, Health Care, Materials, and Tech have also all seen new highs for cumulative breadth. The same applies to the S&P 500, but again, none of these have yet to see price do the same.

> # Election-Year October Market Performance Volatile since 1950

> October’s history of volatility was recapped in the October Almanac as well as it being the worst performing month of election years since 1950. In the following chart we have plotted election-year October performance for DJIA, S&P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 since 1950 (NASDAQ since 1972 and Russell indexes since 1980) alongside their historical performance excluding gruesome election-year October 2008.

> With or without October 2008, historical performance has been uninspiring in election years. Excluding 2008, October has generally started off on a positive note, but by around the fourth trading day, strength has tended to fade with weakness persisting until around the eighth trading day. Then a modest rally ensued through mid-month followed by more weakness and finally a rally to end the month. Grey shading highlights the two historical windows of weakness that could setup our Seasonal MACD indicators.

[Find full shit here](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Street/comments/5ziyjw/jp_morgan_early_look_at_the_market_wed_31517/)

#Trading Update
  
* Market update – it was another relatively quiet night of news. US futures and Eurozone
stocks have a small bid ahead of a busy morning of domestic eco data and the FOMC
decision. Oil prices are rebounding thanks to supportive API data and pos. comments from
Saudi Arabia and Goldman. Opposition to Ryan’s HC bill remains intense w/conservatives in
the House still not thrilled (despite the pos. CBO fiscal score) while Senate moderates (as
many as 12) are demanding substantive changes (any changes will further undermine House
support) and the grassroots Republican press is urging Trump to abandon the legislation.
The healthcare obstacles are ostensibly negative for tax reform although there is more talk
about Republicans pivoting away from repeal/replace and focusing their energies on taxes
and economic growth (before that time comes though Ryan will still try to drag his bill
through the House).
  
* The bottom line for domestic equities remains the same: the SPX is only back to where it
stood before Trump spoke in front of Congress on 2/28 (the index is down just ~1.5% from
the 3/1 2400 high) and the larger risk remains whether the index retraces the whole
“phenomenal” rally (which would move it back to 2300 or lower). Whether that happens
will likely come down to Washington - investors still seem willing to give Trump/Ryan/McConnell the benefit of the doubt on HC until at least the end of Mar but tax doubts are rising.

  * Calendar for Wed 3/15 – the focus will be on the US Mar Empire Manufacturing
(8:30amET), the US CPI and retail sales numbers for Feb (8:30amET), the NAHB housing
index for Mar (10amET), the FOMC decision (2pmET statement/dots and 2:30pmET press
conf.), Trump’s visit to Michigan (where he will hold an event w/auto CEOs), and earnings
(including JBL, ORCL, and WSM after the close).

 * Fed – the big question isn’t whether they hike on 3/15 (the Fed is widely expected
to lift the Fed Funds rate another 25bp) but instead 1) when the second ’17 hike
occurs and 2) what happens w/the median dots. The St is split about hike #2
occurring in either June or Jul (most are penciling in June; the Fed isn’t expected to
move at the May meeting assuming they hike on 3/15). For the median dots, they
now stand at 1.4% for ’17 (which implies three hikes this year), 2.1% for ’18, 2.9%
for ’19, and 3% for L-T – the St is largely expecting the ’17 dot to stay unchanged
(JPM’s M Feroli thinks it will shift up from three to four hikes http://bit.ly/2mQucRu). Looking at the statement, language around growth and inflation is likely to be upgraded and the near-term risks may be just “balanced”
instead of “roughly balanced”.

  * Netherlands - the anti-EU Dutch Freedom Party (PVV) is scheduled to secure a
plurality in the Netherlands on 3/15 and a large victory could rekindle fears around
the other European elections (note that the PVV leader Geert Wilders is unlikely to
become PM as none of the other major parties are expected to partner w/him in a
government).

  * Europe – the major indices have a decent bid (up ~30bp). Basic resources, banks, insurance,
and energy are outperforming while autos, retail, real estate, healthcare, and utilities are
lagging. Zodiac Aerospace, H&M, Munich Re, and Inditex are all trading lower following
earnings reports. Safran said it is still interested in buying Zodiac despite the co’s profit
warning. Hikma Pharma is one of the top stocks in the SXXP after reporting.

  * FX – after rallying Mon/Tues, the DXY is off small so far Wed morning. The USD is trading
lower against most of the major crosses. The GBP is recovering somewhat from the Brexitlinked
weakness on Tues (the UK labor report this morning was solid).

  * Oil – oil prices are rebounding Wed morning following favorable API numbers out overnight
and also thanks to pos. remarks from Saudi Arabia and Goldman – Reuters
http://reut.rs/2mMPajH

  * Asia – markets generally saw mild losses in Asia: Japan (TPX -0.23%, NKY -0.16%), HK (Hang
Seng -0.15%, HSCEI -0.41%), mainland China (SHCOMP +0.08%, Shenzhen -0.02%, CSI 300
+0.2%), Taiwan (TAIEX -0.04%), Korea (KOSPI -0.04%), Australia (ASX 200 +0.26%), and India
(up ~10-15bp for the major indices). Macro news in Asia was pretty quiet and trading was
relatively light. In Japan Toshiba shares slumped 12% amid worries that the stock could be
de-listed. South Korea said it would hold presidential elections on May 9 and the graft
investigation is expanding (media reports suggest South Korean prosecutors have
commenced an investigation into domestic conglomerates Lotte Group and SK Group).
Media reports suggest Samsung Electronics could expand DRAM capacity – that news
weighed on Hynix (down ~2.98%) while Samsung Electronics extended its recent gains (it
ended up 0.1%). In the Hang Seng, Cathay Pacific ended down ~1.3% after an
underwhelming earnings report.

#Top Headlines for Wednesday

  * Eco data/monetary policy – there wasn’t much on the eco front Wed morning other than
the UK labor report (which came in strong – Jan employment +92K vs. the St +87K and the
UR ticked down to 4.7% vs. the St 4.8%). Also ECB’s Praet says a reassessment of current
policy is not yet needed despite signs of improved growth.

  * Ryan just wants to get his healthcare bill out of the House – the NYT discusses how Ryan is
emphasizing the CBO’s forecasted deficit savings to help push his healthcare bill through the
House. However, the CBO report doesn’t seem to be changing the minds of House
conservatives (who remain opposed) but it is causing Senate moderates to grow even more
opposed. Ryan would secure some political coverage if he can move his bill out of the
House, placing responsibility for repeal/replace on McConnell and the Senate (even if Ryan
can pass his bill in the House, it looks very unlikely to make it through the Senate). NYT
http://nyti.ms/2n70Xu8

  * GOP Senators insist Ryan bill won’t pass w/o substantive changes; at least 12 Republican
Senators have expressed reservations about the Ryan bill – WSJ
http://on.wsj.com/2n97sfW

  * Healthcare doubts are rising - GOP divisions are raising doubts that the party can meet an
early-April deadline to pass legislation – Politico http://politi.co/2n9iJNi
  * Trump allies call Ryan’s healthcare bill a “trap” and urge White House to abandon current
healthcare legislative path – a “rebellion” is brewing among conservative populists w/a
growing chorus of voices urging Trump to abandon Ryan’s healthcare bill. “Trump’s allies
worry that he is jeopardizing his presidency by promoting” Ryan’s bill – Washington Post.
http://wapo.st/2nrA8y0

  * Tea Party leader warns that Trump risks alienating grassroots conservative supporters
w/Ryan healthcare bill. Mark Meckler says Trump has some “honeymoon goodwill” but
that will quickly evaporate if he continues to push Ryan’s HC bill. “If the grassroots don't see
some aggressive moves soon on his part to push for full repeal, the honeymoon will come to
a very quick and harsh end. I'm already hearing the rumblings” – The Hill
http://bit.ly/2nq6w3W

  * Trump/Ryan split over healthcare? The Breitbart News report from Tues morning could
mark the beginning of a process to blame Ryan for the current repeal/replace struggles
while protecting Trump from the fallout – Washington Post http://wapo.st/2nkyWzx
  * Treasury staffing – the White House has announced the nominations for six senior Treasury
posts, including senior Goldman banker James Donovan for the agency’s number two role.
WSJ. http://on.wsj.com/2mMqV58

  * Fed/bank supervision (this was out ~8amET Tues morning) – according to Politico, “veteran
banking lawyer” Thomas Vartanian is under consideration for the Fed vice chair of bank
supervision position. Vartanian would be considered a positive for the banking industry.
Politico. http://politi.co/2n573LA

  * Jamie Dimon thinks repatriation could be like QE4 - ""If all companies did [with repatriated
funds] was pay dividends and buy back stock, think of that as QE4 ... and far cheaper, in my
opinion. The shareholder will decide what to do with it. It's not like it disappears after that.
It is fuel to the system” – CNBC http://cnb.cx/2mrKVar
  * Company-specific news update from Wed morning 3/15. In Europe Zodiac Aerospace,
H&M, Munich Re, and Inditex are all trading lower following earnings reports. Safran said it
is still interested in buying Zodiac despite the co’s profit warning. Hikma Pharma is one of
the top stocks in the SXXP after reporting. Hynix shares fell in Asia following the Samsung
DRAM capacity expansion story (Hynix ended down ~2.98%). Cathay Pacific fell ~1.4% in HK
after its earnings underwhelmed expectations. **Toshiba slumped ~12% amid worries the
stock could be delisted.** <----------REKT

 * DRAM/Samsung – news out Wed morning could be considered a neg. for DRAM
pricing; next major DRAM data point will likely be MU earnings on 3/23 –
takeaways from JPM’s JJ Park - according to local newspaper reports, Samsung
Electronics (SEC) plans to invest W10 tn in a new DRAM fab next to Line 17 in
 Hwaseong. We estimate incremental capacity with the new fab to be ~80K, which
accounts for c.20% of SEC’s current DRAM capacity (380K/month) or 7-8% of
installed capacity. Assuming a two-year construction period, production output
from new the DRAM line will hit the market in 2019 at the earliest, in our view.
Given SEC’s aggressive capacity expansion plans, we believe other DRAM makers
such as SK hynix and MU may want to accelerate capacity expansion plans in order
to maintain their shares. https://jpmm.com/research/content/GPS-2284023-0
  * China/memory - Yangtze River Storage Technology's (YMTC) development of 3D
NAND flash technology is well on track; Yangtze hopes to catch up to the world’s
leading memory companies by ‘20 – Digitimes http://bit.ly/2nmF0HW
  * Company-specific news update from Tues night 3/14. It was a slow evening of news. NPTN
was the latest neg. optical data point as the co reported FQ4/Dec results and guided Mar far
below the St (NPTN’s disappointing outlook follows sluggish numbers from ACIA, FNSR, and
CIEN). RUBI posted strong CQ4/Dec numbers but issued soft guidance. MSFT named
LNKD’s Reid Hoffman to its board. GPS announced the appointment of Mark Breitbard as
president and chief executive officer of Banana Republic. CYH announced the sale of four
hospitals (consistent w/guidance provided on the Q4 earnings call).
  * China – the gov’t could launch a bond connect program w/HK (similar to the stock connects
already in existence) – WSJ. http://on.wsj.com/2n99gFK
  * China – Premier Li said the country’s economy is strong and not at risk of a hard landing –

6 months as the gov’t ensures robust growth ahead of the big leadership meeting later this
year – Bloomberg
  * South Korea – the country will hold presidential elections on May 9 – WSJ.
http://on.wsj.com/2nrfn5s
Calendar of events to watch for the week of Mon 3/13

BOE decision (8amET), the US Feb housing starts/building permits (8:30amET), the
Philadelphia Fed for Mar (8:30amET), the US JOLTs for Jan (10amET), Trump’s budget (due

House. However, the CBO report doesn’t seem to be changing the minds of House
conservatives (who remain opposed) but it is causing Senate moderates to grow even more
opposed. Ryan would secure some political coverage if he can move his bill out of the
House, placing responsibility for repeal/replace on McConnell and the Senate (even if Ryan
can pass his bill in the House, it looks very unlikely to make it through the Senate). NYT

  * Tea Party leader warns that Trump risks alienating grassroots conservative supporters
w/Ryan healthcare bill. Mark Meckler says Trump has some “honeymoon goodwill” but
that will quickly evaporate if he continues to push Ryan’s HC bill. “If the grassroots don't see
some aggressive moves soon on his part to push for full repeal, the honeymoon will come to
a very quick and harsh end. I'm already hearing the rumblings” – The Hill

  * Munich Re earnings - Munich Re has this morning released its FY16 results (consistent with
the already announced prelim figures) and guidance for the FY17 year. Net income is
expected in the range of €2.0-2.4bn, below the €2.2-2.7bn range that we had expected,
although consistent with the current FY17 Bloomberg consensus we believe (currently
stands at €2.36bn). As expected Munich Re will conduct another €1bn buyback programme
by the time of the 2018 AGM, this takes total capital return to around 8.3% for the year.

What is on everyone's radar for today's trading day ahead here at r/wallstreetbets?

# **I hope you all have an excellent trading day ahead today on this Wednesday, January 16th, 2019! :)**"
Do you guys think RAD will ever recover?,6,6l05xc,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/6l05xc/do_you_guys_think_rad_will_ever_recover/,39,2017-07-03 19:51:24,
Calls on Walgreens,17,g48iv6,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g48iv6/calls_on_walgreens/,21,2020-04-19 19:56:55,"Walgreens' revenue and profits have been declining over the past few years, even after they purchased Duane Reade. Something like 80% of their revenue comes from Pharmacy - high margin sales with very little OpEx (untill recently they won't even let pharmacists take a lunch break, check out r/WalgreensStores) 

Earlier this year Walgreens signed a 10 year $1.5B contract with a large IT and Business outsourcing company TCS, which basically means that TCS will overtake and optimize majority of their operations to squeeze in as much profits as they can for shareholders by using dirt cheap labor and hyper automation. 
https://m.economictimes.com/tech/ites/tcs-wins-1-5-billion-deal-from-walgreens-boots-largest-from-retail-customer/articleshow/73911981.cms

Typical outsourcing transition time is 6 month, results to be seen in 12. You can start thinking of WBA as an online only pharmacy. 

TL;DR WBA just spent $1.5B to increase their stock price. 
WBA $80 2021"
Walgreens Vaccine Distribution,15,ky2ca6,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ky2ca6/walgreens_vaccine_distribution/,15,2021-01-16 01:23:11,"With the COVID vaccine being distributed more and more, we need to find out who will directly benefit from the distribution. As you can tell by the title I believe that company is WBA. WBA has been severely undervalued for the past year and has just started to rise significantly. 

Some of the factors that have allowed the stock to increase has been a sale of the overseas distribution business. This allows more focus on the growing ecommerce business and the task of employing MDs at 600+ locations.

But as you guessed it, that stuff is already priced in. So what's the thing that is currently being undervalued? or not being taken in account? Yes Walgreens vaccine distribution. Already Walgreens has started the process of distributing the vaccine. 

However Walgreens will not profit for the distribution directly. Meaning that they wont be paid large sums of money from the government to vaccinate the public. BUT they will benefit from the increased foot traffic in their stores when the community has to come in for **2** doses. 

In an earnings call on Jan 7th management downplayed the benefits from distributing the vaccine. Saying that the benefit of ""COVID vaccines is likely to be offset by COVID headwind"". Spoiler alert! : Covid headwinds have been happening since March. How dare you tell your telling your shareholders that the benefit of distributing the vaccine is nil. 

This is why I think that the company is intentionally downplaying the benefits of distribution in order to post a next quarter earnings beat. 

Barclays analyst Steven Valiquette states: ""the  Covid-19 vaccine  benefit  will  likely  be quite material on the core retail pharmacy side as it is largely expected to offset most of the \~$200  mln Covid/flu headwinds the  company expects in  F2Q21.""

The theory of management downplaying the distribution in order to beat estimates is strengthened when you look at CEO Stefano Pessina. Over the summer he planned to step down, which makes sense because the man is 79. But also if you were finally ready for retirement, wouldn't you want a little cash to throw around? The bulk of Stefano's $8.5 billion dollar fortune is purely WBA stock. So is it crazy to think that he could use a manufactured earnings beat to give one last pump to the stock?

And that's where us autist come in. If Stefano is going to profit off this, so will we.

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Thursday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/14/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-thursday-oct-14.html)

*****

> # 1. Stock futures rise after S&P 500, Nasdaq broke 3-day losing streaks

> * Dow futures gained nearly 300 points Thursday as investors consider a flood of strong bank and health-care-related earnings as well as upcoming data on wholesale inflation and jobless claims. The 10-year Treasury yield dipped to around 1.53%, one day after minutes from the Federal Reserve’s latest meeting revealed a “gradual tapering process” of bond purchases could begin by mid-November. U.S. oil prices continued to power higher, jumping to more than $81 per barrel. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq on Wednesday broke three-session losing streaks. However, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell for a fourth straight session.

*****

> # 2. Data on wholesale inflation, jobless claims out before the bell

> * The government is set to issue two key economics reports at 8:30 a.m. ET: the September producer price index and initial jobless claims. Economists expect first-time filings for unemployment benefits to drop to 318,000 for the week ended Oct. 9. Headline PPI and core PPI, which excludes the food and energy sectors, are expected to remain high, Thursday’s wholesale inflation comes after Wednesday’s elevated consumer inflation data. With price pressures mounting, the Social Security cost-of-living adjustment next year will be 5.9%, the biggest boost in about 40 years.

*****

> # 3. Banks, health-related companies see shares rise on strong results

> * The pace of earnings season accelerated Thursday, with slew of banks reporting quarterly results before the bell and their shares moving higher in premarket trading.
> * Bank of America was first up, saying third-quarter earnings and revenue beat estimates on strong advisory and asset management results.
> * Morgan Stanley beat estimates with quarterly earnings and revenue on record investment banking and asset management results.
> * Wells Fargo posted a jump in profit in the third quarter, boosted by a release of credit loss reserves. Revenue beat estimates.
> * Citigroup’s quarterly profit and revenue beat expectations on strong trading results.
> * Dow stocks UnitedHealth and Walgreens Boots Alliance also reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue. Those stocks jumped in the premarket.
> * Walgreens administered twice as many Covid vaccines as expected.
> * UnitedHealth raised its full-year outlook.

*****

> # 4. FDA vaccine panel gets ready to consider Moderna, J&J boosters

> * The FDA’s vaccine advisory group meets Thursday to consider a booster for Moderna’s two-shot Covid regimen. FDA scientists on Tuesday declined to take a stance it. The agency’s panel then meets Friday to consider a booster for Johnson & Johnson’s one-dose vaccine and mix-and-match vaccine data. A highly anticipated NIH study, released Wednesday, suggests J&J recipients are better off getting a booster from Pfizer or Moderna. Also on Wednesday, the FDA said data provided by J&J suggests recipients may benefit from an additional dose. A booster of Pfizer’s two-shot vaccine was approved for certain groups of people last month.

*****

> # 5. Foreclosures surge as Covid mortgage bailouts expire

> * Foreclosures are starting to jump as government and private sector programs designed to help homeowners deal with the economic fallout of the Covid pandemic have begun to expire. Mortgage lenders began the foreclosure process on 25,209 properties in the third quarter, a 32% increase from the second quarter. On a year-over-year basis, it’s a 67% rise from the third quarter of 2020, according to Attom, a mortgage data firm. States with the largest number of new foreclosures were California, Texas, Florida, New York and Illinois.

Ofourse this is not about a chinese meme stock, or overbeaten meme stocks. Funny how the post is sent to oblivion  maybe because it didn't feature screenshots which was trivial irrelevant insecure expectations. Just so you know, not all traders have a robinhood account with all positions, in my case I have over 50 positions in multiple stocks spread across 6 accounts, it's stupid to expect someone spend hours to craft a proof?  Anyway thanks for the geniuses who sent the earlier to oblivion, you made wsb a better place. 

Out of 11 trades, 7 are profitable at this moment and 3 are wrong with 1 TBD. Of course these can changed either way by end of Friday. I can take off decent profits off the table, however I'll be holding to see if the moves I need is achieved for next couple of days.

# **What to watch in the market in the week ahead: Stocks on track for best first half in 22 years  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/21/what-to-watch-in-the-market-in-the-week-ahead-stocks-on-track-for-best-first-half-in-22-years.html)**
*****
> The fate of U.S.-China trade talks could play out in the week ahead, and that could set the tone for markets and the economy in the second half of the year.
*****
> Stocks set new highs in the past week, after the Federal Reserve signaled it was ready to cut interest rates if necessary, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell said trade and the global economy are two factors the Fed is watching.
*****
> The S&P 500 was on track, as of Friday, to score a more than 17.6% gain for the first half, which ends Friday. If it stays at that level that would be the best first half performance since 1997, when the S&P was up 19.4% in the first six months.
*****
> The big event in the coming week has been as anticipated for weeks, and it could sway sentiment for weeks to come. At the end of the week, the G-20 meets in Osaka Japan for meetings Friday and Saturday.
*****
> ‘Could go either way’
> President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are expected to have their own dinner meeting at the G-20 next weekend, following discussions between their trade representatives. That meeting could decide how trade negotiations go forward, and whether the U.S. proceeds with another round of tariffs, this time on $300 billion in goods.
*****
> “Everybody knows the Trump, Xi meeting could go either way,” said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex. “I think everyone expects a new tariff freeze. That the $300 billion won’t go into effect. The most you can hope for out of G-20 meeting is the tariffs are where they are right now, and there’s no more escalation.That also means China will not release the list of companies they won’t do business with.”
*****
> Chandler said he will be looking for signaling from Trump and Xi on whether they are working on a deal that would be just on the trade topics, or bigger issues like North Korea and differences on the South China Sea.
*****
> “I do think the G-20 is quite important in that there’s not question in recent months, the trade war started to really move into measures of confidence and measures of manufacturing activity,” said Ethan Harris, head of global economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Harris said he expects a positive message with an agreement of no further escalation, but probably not signs of significant progress. “I think the vibes coming out of it will be modestly positive,” he said.
*****
> “Whether there’s an escalation to the next round of China tariffs is going to set the theme for the rest of the year. Even if tariffs on China are reversed, or partly reversed, at some point, every time there’s an escalation or temporary escalation, it’s another kind of blow to confidence,” he said.
*****
> Harris said there’s the same risk as after the Trump, Xi meeting at the last G-20, where it was a positive tone but there was little progress afterwards and the markets then reacted negatively.
*****
> “I think there’s been this broad increased awareness from every economist that the trade war is starting to have noticeable impact. Further escalation with China would be quite a big signal. If the Trump administration puts tariffs on all the Chinese products it roughly doubles the size of the trade war and it sends a very strong message that there are very few constraints on where [Trump] goes next,” he said.
*****
> Powell and data
> Besides the meeting between Trump and Xi, the market focus will be on anything that could provide clues on what the Fed or even the European Central Bank will do, after ECB President Mario Draghi last week basically promised a new era of easing. Consumer price inflation data is expected for the euro zone, and on Friday, the U.S. personal consumption expenditure data is released, including the PCE deflator, a major inflation indicator for the Fed.
*****
> There are also a few Fed speakers, including Powell who speaks at the Council on Foreign Relations Tuesday.
*****
> “It’s probably going to be a big picture kind of talk about the broader challenges of the Fed,” said Ethan Harris, head of global economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. “They’re certainly going to ask questions about political influence at the Fed, and he’s going to dodge those. I think what I’m waiting for him to comment on is what it is they’re looking for to determine whether they’re going to cut in July or not.”
*****
> Harris said Powell is not likely to say anything he did not reveal at his press briefing in the past week, and the big focus will be on the lead up to the weekend G-20.
*****
> Falling interest rates and rising oil prices were two big factors in the market int he past week. The 10-year Treasury yield dipped briefly below 2%, a near 3-year low, as the Fed signaled its willingness to cut interest rates.
*****
> “Should we get some sort of trade agreement that would be a nice pop to the [stock] market, but that could take the rate cut off the table,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.
*****
> Stovall said the stock market will also be watching oil after its rapid run higher, and the events in the Middle East surrounding Iran. West Texas Intermediate futures were up more than 9% in the past week, to $57.43.
*****
> “The old adage is every $10 increase in the price of oil takes off 20 to 25 basis points off of real GDP growth,” he said.
*****
> Stovall said stocks have had a solid run so far this year, but they may face some rocky times between now and the end of the summer. “For the rest of this ‘sell in May’ period we could be facing some challenges, headwinds. I think we’ will still end higher on the year. I think the seasonally optimistic September to November period will kick in but there will be a lot of challenges...will the Fed be cutting rates? what are the growth prospects?” he said.

# Big S&P 500 Junes Drain Life from Julys

> S&P 500 is off to it best June performance since 1955, up 7.34% as of yesterday’s close. If yesterday was the last trading day of June, this performance would have been strong enough to push the month to 6th best going back to 1930. Looking back to late May, this performance is still impressive even though it was anticipated following May’s abysmal showing. However, such strong performance in June may not carry over into July.

> Below S&P 500 performance in June has been split into positive and negative tables. Each table contains July’s historical performance as well as full-year performance. Historically July has been weaker after a positive June. July averages just 0.48% after an up June compared to a gain of 2.84% after a down June. Examining the Top 20 Junes and subsequent Julys showed only a modest improvement in performance with average July gain climbing to 1.11%. However, even if July does disappoint this year, the full year is likely to still be quite fair as past positive Junes where followed by full-year gains 80% of the time with an average gain of 13.44%.

# Can Stocks Really Gain 20% This Year?

> U.S. stocks could have a big year if LPL Research’s forecasts prove correct.

> All year, we’ve maintained our fair value target on the S&P 500 Index of 3,000, implying that we expect this bull market and economic expansion to continue. If the S&P 500 closes the year at 3,000, the index will have gained 19.7% in 2019.

> On the surface, that seems like a high hurdle for U.S. stocks. However, the S&P 500 has already gained about 16% this year, so a rally to 3,000 isn’t far out of reach.

> The S&P 500 also hasn’t posted a 20% gain for the year since 2013, an unusually long stretch compared to history.

> “It is interesting that the S&P 500 hasn’t gained more than 20% in any one year for five consecutive years,” noted LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Only once since 1950 did it go more than five years in a row without gaining 20%, thus if this pattern continues we very well might get to 20% in 2019.”

> As our LPL Chart of the Day “Can The S&P 500 Index Really Gain 20% This Year?” shows, it is quite rare for the S&P 500 to go this long without a 20% annual gain. Could the streak end in 2019? Be sure to read our Midyear Outlook 2019, which is set for release next week, for more on why this could be the case.

# Prospect of Lower Rates Lifts Gold

> As widely anticipated, the Fed did not change its target rate today. Instead, the Fed set the stage for cuts possibly later this year. Overall, the market’s response was a choppy climb to a modestly higher close. A more enthusiastic move by the market may have occurred if the Fed cut rates. Gold’s reaction was more favorable, finishing the day higher by over 1%. Generally, the lower interest rates go, the more desirable gold can become as lower rates typically result in a weaker dollar.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/06ee5a896971da25f3f06e3861567f44/tumblr_inline_ptd73ep0rI1spdppr_500.jpg))**

> In the above chart, gold’s monthly performance from 1975 to 2018 is displayed. Historically, October has been gold’s worst month and June is a close second. Historically, after weakness in June, gold has, on average, enjoyed solid gains in July, August and September. Some of this strength in gold is likely due to safe-haven demand during the stock market’s worst two months, August and September. Gold’s best three months, July to September, could easily be above average this year, especially if the Fed decides to cut sooner rather than later.

*****

# Are Bulls An Endangered Species?

> The S&P 500 Index closed at a new all-time high yesterday, the 5th new high so far in 2019. After May, the worst month for the S&P 500 since 2010, June is up 7.3% as of 06.20.19, which would be the best June since 1955.

> Much of the rally this month has been sparked by a more dovish Federal Reserve (Fed), combined with U.S.-China trade discussions potentially back on track.

> What’s quite interesting about things now though, is many signs of investor sentiment are a long way from bullish. Remember, from a contrarian (or opposing) point of view, this can suggest there is still money on the sidelines.

> “The S&P 500 might be at new highs, but global fund managers and individual investors are quite underweight equities right now,” explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “If you are looking for a reason this rally can continue, that could be it.”

> For example, the recent Bank of America Merrill Lynch June Global Fund Manager Survey (a survey of managers who oversee more than $600 billion in assets) showed the largest jump in cash since August 2011. Additionally, equity allocation was the lowest it had been since March 2009, and the equity-to-bond allocation was the lowest since May 2009. Not to mention the allocation to bonds was the highest it had been in eight years. “Money on the sidelines might sound cliché, but it really seems to be the case this time,” said Detrick. With the S&P 500 hitting more all-time highs, having money in the market may make more sense (or cents!).

> Individual investors are skeptical as well, as the recent American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) Sentiment Survey showed more bears than bulls for six straight weeks, the longest stretch since November 2016. Finally, as our LPL Chart of the Day shows, AAII bulls have been under 30% for six consecutive weeks for the first time since January 2016.

# Broad Strength in Health Care Sector

> In an earlier post, we highlighted the fact that some of the ten best performing S&P 500 Industries between the S&P 500's highs on 4/30 and 6/20 were from the Health Care sector. It hasn't just been these four industries that have been strong in the Health Care sector either. The performance snapshot of the sector below shows just how strong the sector has been lately. While all six of the industries within the sector aren't up YTD or so far in Q2, between the S&P 500's highs on 4/30 and 6/20, Health Care is the only sector where every industry within the sector has posted positive returns. Not even the industries within the Utilities sector have been this uniformly positive. The best performer of the bunch has been Health Care Technology, which is up 8% since the end of April and has extended its YTD gain to 36.8%. The worst performing industry in the sector has been Biotech which is up 2.1% since 4/30, and while that may not sound like much, it's still better than more than half of the other industries in the index.

# Best and Worst Groups Between Highs

> While the S&P 500 made a new high for the first time in 35 trading days yesterday, many of the characteristics of the groups driving the rally have shifted. To highlight this, in the table below we summarize the ten best and worst performing S&P 500 Industries from the close on 4/30 through yesterday. During that 35 trading day stretch, 34 Industries saw positive returns while another 27 declined.

> Industries that have seen the biggest gains between the two new highs are primarily defensive in nature as all but three come from sectors that are typically considered defensive (Consumer Staples, Health Care, and Real Estate). Health Care has been the real star of the show, though. Of the sector's six different industries, four of them made the top ten!

> On the downside, cyclical industries have dominated the weak side. When industries like Semis, Autos, Construction & Engineering, and Air Freight are lagging the market, it really illustrates the presence of economic concerns. Leading the way lower, Energy Equipment and Services declined over 10%, followed by Semiconductors which were down just under 10% after failing at resistance on Thursday for the third time in a month. These two industries are followed by two industries (Tobacco and Power and Renewable Energy) that come from sectors that are traditionally considered defensive, but they have their own specific issues to deal with.

Good afternoon and happy Saturday to all of you on this subreddit. I hope everyone made out pretty nicely in the market last week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead! :)

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 1st, 2019.

# **Key data could end or defend recession fears as stocks notch best quarter in a decade  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/29/data-could-end-or-defend-recession-fears-as-stocks-notch-best-quarter.html)**
*****
> Stocks head into the second quarter propelled by the best quarter in nearly a decade as the long tepid IPO market starts to simmer again.
*****
> But the markets also face a reality check in the week ahead with some key data that could help clarify whether the economy is losing steam or just stumbling through a soft patch. The key release is Friday's March jobs report, with economists expecting 170,000 new nonfarm payrolls, after February's deeply disappointing 20,000 jobs, according to Refinitiv. There is also important manufacturing data from China over the weekend and the U.S. on Monday.
*****
> Lyft Inc's big IPO Friday on the back of Levi Strauss the week earlier has boosted some optimism for a year of new offerings that some analysts say could rival or surpass the more than $100 billion record of new issues in the year 2000, if conditions remain good.
*****
> ""The Levi Strauss IPO and the success it had last week encouraged many of these companies to accelerate their timing,"" said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Advisors. ""IPO issuance has been modest relative to history for the last couple of years, so the fact we're finally seeing some companies come to market may signal some kind of optimism or confidence, but it's far from the type of thing we've seen historically in terms of the euphoria surrounding it.""
*****
> Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Alliance said with $700 million in potential offerings in the wings, this year could surpass the all-time record reached in 2000, when the new issue market was viewed as overheated and many companies without earnings or prospects made it into the public arena during the tech bubble.
*****
> ""In general, big IPOs tend to drive general enthusiasm for the overall market until they don't do well,"" said Hogan, noting the follow through trading in Lyft, the biggest IPO since Alibaba went public in 2014. Lyft, priced at $72, surged about 20 percent on the opening but closed up just about 8.7 percent at $78.29.
*****
> Stocks were higher in the past week, and the S&P 500 turned in its best first quarter performance since 1998. The 12.9 percent gain was also the best quarterly performance since the third quarter of 2009, just as the now 10-year-old bull market took off. The S&P is now less than 4 percent from its record high.
*****
> Earnings season kicks off in the next several weeks, and between now and then there could be some high profile warnings on the first quarter, expected to be the first quarter with negative earnings growth in three years.
*****
> Arone said while earnings are expected to be weaker, revenues are expected to grow by nearly 5 percent, a positive sign.
*****
> ""That needs to be reconciled form my perspective. It wouldn't shock me if companies doe better than expected, and end up with positive year-over-year comparisons,"" said Arone.
*****
> Trade talks with China remain the overriding issue for markets. Chinese Vice Premier Lui He comes to Washington to meet with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who traveled to Beijing this past week.
*****
> Analysts expect a deal in the coming months. ""We're likely to get some type of negotiated deal that both sides can claim victory on, where China will buy more U.S. goods, where there is some progress on U.S. intellectual property and technology transfers...But I don't see a deal that's going to be a game changer...a big move in one direction. I think the market has accepted that reality,"" said Arone.
*****
> In the past week, stocks were higher but so were bonds, to the point where the 10-year yield reached a low of 2.34 percent before returning to the 2.40 percent level. Yields move opposite price.
*****
> The week earlier, the 10-year yield dipped beneath the yield on the 3-month bill, meaning the yield curve was inverted. When that happens and long-term rates are lower than short-term rates, it is viewed as a recession warning. Practically it would mean lenders, who borrow on a short term basis, would be lending at the lower longer term rates.
*****
> The bond market also moved to price in a Fed interest rate cut this year, after pricing in a hike just several months ago. That was in response to the Fed's forecast for no more rate cuts this year, released after its March meeting. It had been forecasting two interest rate hikes previously. The fed funds futures now is priced for a quarter point of easing this year and another next year.
*****
> Markets calmed down as the week came to a close, but every piece of data has become more important. On a positive note, weekly jobless claims data, the most current look at the labor market, showed a downtick and the four week average is now 217,000, the lowest since January.
*****
> The economy's growth definitely slowed down in the first quarter and growth was tracking at about 1.5 percent, after the 2.2 percent gain in the fourth quarter. Economists have expected the weakness in the first quarter, both due to the government shutdown and bad winter weather, to be temporary but the question is whether growth can get a jump start in the second quarter.
*****
> ""The jobs number is key here,"" said Wilmington Trust chief economist Luke Tilley. The February report showed just a tenth of the job creation many economists had expected. ""Our best thinking it it's statistical volatility, and it's not a real indication of what's going on in the labor market, and it will bounce back. That's the most important thing that's coming out next week....We think about 200,000 jobs were added. I think there's some upside risks to that.""
*****
> Tilley said manufacturing data in the week ahead will be important, as it could show whether the sector remained sluggish at the end of the first quarter. March ISM manufacturing and PMI data will be released Monday, and durable goods, which includes business spending data, is important when it is released on Tuesday. Monthly vehicle sales are also released Tuesday.
*****
> Economists expect ISM manufacturing at 54.2, unchanged from the month earlier. China was also to release manufacturing PMI data over the weekend.
*****
> February's delayed U.S. retail sales report is also expected on Monday. Retail sales are expected to have gained 0.3 percent in the month, up from 0.2 percent in January and December's shocking decline.
*****
> Steve Massocca, managing director at Wedbush Securities, said he's watching for any sign of inflation in wages when the jobs report is released Friday. The Fed's preferred PCE inflation index showed sluggish inflation growth, up just 0.1 percent in February.
*****
> ""I don't think [the data] is as big an issue as it was when the Fed was actively talking about raising rates,"" said Massocca. 
""They said publicly they're not going to raise rates for the rest fo the year.""
*****
> There are just a few Fed speakers, who will be of interest because of the change in market expectations for Fed interest rate policy. Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester speaks Thursday, and Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic speaks both Wednesday and Friday.

# What Does A Big First Quarter Mean?

> With a day to go, this is one of the best first quarters for the S&P 500 Index ever. Of course, it comes on the heels of the worst fourth quarter since the financial crisis and the worst December since the Great Depression. Still, you have to be impressed with the overall bounce back after the big drop late last year.

> “A big start to the year historically has suggested the bulls could remain in charge the rest of the year,” explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “In fact, 9 of the past 10 times the S&P 500 was up at least 10% during the first quarter, the rest of the year was also in the green.”

> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, continued gains the final three quarters of the year were quite normal after a big first quarter. It is worth noting, however, that extreme gains might not be in the cards, as the average return for the final three quarters of the year is 5.8%, which is actually lower than the average year’s final three quarters of 6.3%.

# April Almanac: DJIA’s Best Month

> April marks the end of our “Best Six Months” for DJIA and the S&P 500. On April 1st, we will begin looking for our seasonal MACD sell signal and corresponding early signs of seasonal weakness. Even in historically strong pre-election years the “Worst Six Months” have been lackluster on average. 

> April 1999 was the first month to gain 1000 DJIA points. However, from 2000 to 2005, “Tax” month was hit, declining in four of six years. Since 2006, April has been up thirteen years in a row with an average gain of 2.3% to reclaim its position as the best DJIA month since 1950. April is third best for S&P and fourth best for NASDAQ (since 1971).

> The first half of April used to outperform the second half, but since 1994 that has no longer been the case. The effect of April 15 Tax Deadline appears to be diminished with numerous bullish days present on either side of the day. Traders and investors are clearly focused on first quarter earnings and guidance during April. Exceptional Q1 earnings and positive surprises tend to be anticipated with stocks and the market moving up in advance of the announcements and consolidating or correcting afterwards.

> Typical pre-election year strength does bolster April’s performance since 1950. April is DJIA’s best month in pre-election years (+4.0%), second best for S&P 500 (+3.5%) and third best for NASDAQ (+3.5%). Small caps measured by the Russell 2000 also perform well with gains (+2.8%) in seven of ten pre-election year April’s since 1979.

# First Trading Day of Q2: DJIA and S&P 500 Higher 75% of the Time

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c2517e648cdac3635e6063406fd1de2e/tumblr_inline_pp5990Be4E1spdppr_500.jpg))**

> According to the Stock Trader’s Almanac 2019, the first trading day of April is DJIA’s fifth best first trading day of all months based upon total points gained. Looking back at the last 25 years, in the tables below, we can see DJIA and S&P 500 have both advanced 75.0% of the time (up 18 of last 24) with average gains right around 0.4%. NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have slightly weaker track records but are both still up more frequently then down. Last year, April’s first trading day was dealt a blow with losses exceeding 2% by S&P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000.

# Good News Indicators

> The Conference Board’s Leading Economic Index (LEI) is one of our favorite economic indicators. It is designed to predict future movements in the economy based on a composite of 10 economic indicators (like manufacturers’ new orders, stock prices, and weekly unemployment claims) whose changes tend to precede shifts in the overall economy. Last week, the LEI expanded for the first time in five months, along the way tying the all-time high set September 2018. Additionally, it is up 3% year over year (YoY).

> The combination of continued weak economic data around the globe and various parts of the yield curve inverting are leading many to surmise that a recession is likely imminent. The good news is that the LEI has not turned negative on a YoY basis, which it has done prior to every recession since the 1970s. And even when it has turned negative, it was another eight months on average before a recession officially occurred (with a median of six months lag time). For this reason, and because of its solid track record of predicting recessions, the LEI is a component of LPL Research’s Five Forecasters.

> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the LEI remains well above the 0% YoY threshold, which would be a definite negative—on multiple levels.

# 11 Things You Need To Know About The Yield Curve

> Well, it finally happened—the yield curve inverted. Now note that it was the shorter end of the curve that inverted, as the 3-month Treasury bill (and 1-year T-bill) now yields more than the 10-year Treasury for the first time since 2007. This matters because an inverted yield curve is the bond market’s way of saying there is a potential recession on the horizon. “The yield curve inversion is something that nearly everyone is talking about, given its perfect track record at predicting recessions,” explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “At the same time, however, we simply aren’t seeing other areas of the economy that would confirm a recession just yet, so there is more to this story.”

> Please note that there is no one true “yield curve,” as the yield curve simply looks at the yields of a shorter-dated fixed income instrument and compares it to a longer-dated one. In fact, the more commonly discussed 2-year/10-year yield curve spread hasn’t inverted, and it is actually above the early December 2018 lows.

> Here are 11 things worth considering regarding the yield curve.

> * Each of the past 9 recessions back to the 1950s saw the 1-year/10-year yield curve spread invert approximately 14 months on average before a recession.
> * Although a yield curve inversion preceded all 9 previous recessions, not all inversions led to a recession. For instance, the 3-month/10-year yield curve inverted in 1966 and 1998, with neither leading to an immediate recession.
> * The shorter end of the yield curve has inverted, but the longer end is actually steepening. For instance, the 10-year/30-year yield curve has steepened most of this year. In past recessions, all parts of the curve inverted before a recession took place.
> * Financial conditions aren’t tight, as tight conditions coupled with the yield curve inverting, historically has led to a recession. Investment-grade corporate and high yield spreads remain calm, however, suggesting that not all parts of the bond market are worried about an impending recession.
> * Market participants have fully priced in a Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cut within the next year, potentially further flattening the curve. Should the economy gain steam during the second half of this year (which we think is possible) it will likely avoid a Fed rate cut, which should lead to a steeper yield curve.
> * We have found that a spread between the 3-month/10-year yield curve has become much more predictive of a recession at -50 basis points (-0.50%). So this still is a clear concern, but a marginal inversion may not be so worrisome.
> * Yield curves aren’t always perfect: Japan has had long stretches of inverted curves that didn’t lead to recessions. Additionally, both the United Kingdom and Germany have had inversions without recessions.
> * The fed funds rate has been significantly higher during previous inversions. In fact, the fed funds rate has averaged more than 6% when the 1-year/10-year yield curve has inverted. It is only 2.4% currently.
> * The previous 5 recessions began an average of 21 months after the 2-year/10-year yield curve inverted. Stocks actually did quite well initially after inversions as well, with the S&P 500 Index not peaking until over a year after the inversions and gaining nearly 22% on average at the peak.

> * Various yields around the globe continue to sink, with nearly $10 trillion in global debt now yielding less than 0%. The German 10-year Bund, for instance, is beneath 0% for the first time since 2016. We think this is due more to a concern over the European slowdown, which has forced many to look to the United States as a safe haven for sovereign debt, thus pushing our yields much lower along the way. This concept is discussed in more depth in our latest episode of the LPL Market Signals podcast.
> * As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the S&P 500 has actually outperformed the average year the previous three times the 2-year/10-year yield curve inverted. To reiterate though, the 2/10 spread hasn’t inverted yet.

# The Bespoke Report — Good, Bad, Or Ugly?

> Stocks have basically held the line this week despite huge moves in interest rates and an ongoing rough run for global economic data. Curve inversion has many forecasting a recession, and we’ve seen a number of recent data releases that make us much more nervous about that outcome than we have been in almost a decade. On the other hand, the pivot to dovishness from global central banks, the relatively modest size and scale of yield curve inversion, some nascent signs of bottoming in global growth, and the nature of the plunge in interest rates are all reasons to not panic. Besides, despite all of the negativity US stocks have held up admirably well, and markets that trend higher on bad news are generally regarded as strong, rather than weak. In short, the outlook could be Good, Bad, or Ugly…depending how you read the tea leaves!

# A Strange Trip With Some Strange Leaders

> With sentiment where it was at the end of last year following the Q4 rout in equities, it’s safe to say that not a lot of investors were expecting double-digit gains in the first quarter. That’s exactly what we have seen in US equities, though, as the major averages are all up over 10% YTD heading into the final hours of the quarter. While the Dow has lagged many of its peer indices this year, it too is still on pace to finish Q1 with a gain of just over 10%.

> In the table below, we show how each of the 30 components in the DJIA have performed on a YTD basis as well as how much they have contributed to the index’s total gains. Remember, the DJIA is a price-weighted index, so the sole determinant of a stock’s weight in the index is its price. Looking at the table, you’re likely not the only one doing a double-take at the two stocks that top the list of best performers in the index so far this year. That’s right, Cisco (CSCO) and IBM have been the index’s two top performers in 2019 with gains of nearly 24%. Behind these two stocks, United Technologies (UTX) and Apple (AAPL) are the only two other stocks that are up 20% or more. To the downside, just five stocks in the DJIA are in the red on a YTD basis. Leading the way lower, Walgreens Boots (WBA), the newest stock in the index, has declined over 7%, but none of the four other stocks are down more than 3%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/032919-DJIA-Performance-1.png))**

> Because the DJIA is price-weighted, the best-performing stocks in the index haven’t been the biggest contributors to the YTD gains. The chart below shows how many points each stock in the index has contributed to the YTD gains. Looking at things this way, you may be surprised to see that Boeing (BA) still tops the list. With its 17% YTD gain and very high share price, BA has contributed 374 points to the DJIA’s upside this year, beating out the next closest component (AAPL) by 160 points! All else being equal, BA could fall another 23 points (6.0%) and it would still be the largest contributor to the DJIA’s YTD gains.

#[Today's Top Headlines for Thursday, April 2nd, 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/02/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-april-2-2020.html)

*****

> * U.S. stock futures were pointing to an over 300-point rebound for the Dow Jones Industrial Average at Thursday’s open ahead of what’s expected to be another unprecedented number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits. The Dow closed nearly 4.5% lower on the first day of the second quarter after logging the worst first-quarter ever. The 10-year Treasury yield dropped to under 0.6% early Thursday as global coronavirus cases approach 1 million. Oil futures bounced about 10% from highly depressed levels after President Donald Trump said he expected Saudi Arabia and Russia to reach a deal soon to end their price war.

*****

> * Economists expect that 4 million to 5 million, or even more, workers filed for jobless claims last week. The Labor Department releases its weekly tally at 8:30 a.m. ET. The consensus forecast is for 3.1 million first-time claims after the previous week’s record high of nearly 3.3. million. On Friday, the government issues its monthly report on job creation. However, the March numbers are expected to show little impact from the outbreak because the survey period went only to about the middle of the month — before the effects of the stay-at-home orders were felt.

*****

> * The president is set to meet with the leaders of at least seven major energy companies on Friday as U.S. producers struggle to break even after crude prices recently hit 18-year lows and turned in the worst quarter ever. Trump, at Wednesday evening’s outbreak briefing, said the administration is considering halting some domestic flights and rail lines between cities hard hit by the virus. Also Wednesday, White House health advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said the first human trial testing a potential vaccine to prevent COVID-19 is “on track” with public distribution still projected in 12 to 18 months. He called it the “ultimate game changer” in the fight to control the pandemic.

*****

> * With coronavirus testing becoming more widespread, U.S. confirmed cases surged to more than 216,700, according to Johns Hopkins University data. American fatalities rose to 5,137. The White House, predicting a “very, very painful two weeks,” estimates a death toll of 100,000 to 240,000. Globally, known cases reached about 942,000 — nearing 1 million since the outbreak started in China in December. There have been 47,521 worldwide deaths and about 186,000 recoveries. Italy has the second most cases globally at more than 110,500, nearly half the U.S. total. But it has the most deaths, 13,155.

*****

> * Boeing — whose stock has been slammed by the coronavirus economic halt and last year’s grounding of its 737 Max fleet — is reportedly set to start offering early retirement and buyout packages to workers. Several media outlets, including The Wall Street Journal, said that an internal announcement is expected as soon as Thursday. Last week, Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun said it will take “a few years” for the company to get its balance sheet back in shape, but he balked at the idea of the government taking an equity stake in the company in exchange for aid.

The Rite Aid (RAD) buyout is not a rumor,39,4o5b5v,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/4o5b5v/the_rite_aid_rad_buyout_is_not_a_rumor/,29,2016-06-15 08:43:28,"Walgreens (WBA) is going to buyout Rite aid (RAD) sometime before the year ends, if you want a quick gain you need to hop on before it it follows through. We've all seen how well it worked out for LinkedIn when MSFT bought them out. It might not be a huge gain this time around but there's strong evidence that it's going to follow through. 

http://www.forbes.com/sites/brucejapsen/2016/06/12/walgreens-finally-cuts-ties-with-theranos/?utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=partner&utm_campaign=yahootix&partner=yahootix&yptr=yahoo

Here's the important quote from that: 

The move by Walgreens was expected as pressure mounted on the nation’s largest drugstore chain. The company’s relationship with Theranos has hurt Walgreens’ image with investors and the public at large as the pharmacy giant is close to finalizing an acquisition of Rite Aid.

 (Older news) This one is a puff piece for Walgreens but it still mentions RAD:

Buy RAD stocks/calls FTW,29,f2u61h,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f2u61h/buy_rad_stockscalls_ftw/,15,2020-02-12 22:24:20,"\- new CEO with strong digital track record will release new strategic plan on St Patrick's day.  On Aug 12, 2019 when she was hired, the stock opened at $7.33 vs $13.55 today.

\- last quarter was the CEO's first full quarter at the helm, Zack's reported an earnings beat of 1700%  [https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/678142/rite-aid-rad-q3-earnings-and-revenues-top-estimates](https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/678142/rite-aid-rad-q3-earnings-and-revenues-top-estimates)

\- the previous CEO tried to sell the company for 18 cents per share plus 1/10th of a share of unknown value in Alberton's, after allowing someone else to negotiate the deal who was apparently going to receive compensation from a third party if the deal was approved -- this arrangement was apparently not revealed to the board until after the negotiations were complete if i recall correctly.  The previous CEO also had terms in the deal where he would become CEO of the combined company after the merger, and they allegedly did not agree on his salary as part of the negotiations.  ISS / Glass Lewis reviewed the terms of the deal and recommended RAD shareholder's vote against.  There was other questionable behavior like warning about an inability to compete / re-imbursement pressures right before the merger vote to scare shareholders (imo) and writing down the good will value of the PBM that was bought for $2B, spending millions to integrate rite aid software with albertson's before the merger was approved (and ultimately cancelled the night before the vote)

\- I believe the price is being held down in part by analyst price targets, RAD was finally about to cross $10 / share when DB decided to initiate coverage with a price target of $5 / share.  After RAD destroyed earnings estimates, DB's target was updated to $12 which was again below the current price

\- the previous CEO was rated the 4th worst CEO in America by one observer

\- the stock shot up to $23.88/share after chrismas because of their earnings, but then was shorted back down to the current price of $13.22

\- Last night the WSJ reported updated short interest of almost 36% of the float as of 1/31

\- CVS had earnings this AM with same store sales up 3.2% with pharmacy sales up 4.1%

\- RAD price/book = 0.69, price/sales = 0.03.  WBA is 5.67 & 4.82 respectively.  CVS is 2.54 & 0.96

\- Priced in (imo): massive short position, a belief that the previous CEO was doing his best, ""fake"" price targets like $1/share, etc

Edit: from Investor Relations on quarterly results date: "" Our year ends in February.  I am thinking it will be end of March beginning of April.  I will mark to email you once I get a specific date. """

#[Today's Top Headlines for Thursday, January 7th, 2021](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/07/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-january-7-2021.html)

*****

> # 1. Dow set to add to Wednesday’s record despite Capitol turmoil

> * U.S. stock futures rose Thursday, a day after the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a record high despite the turmoil at the Capitol. Early Thursday, outgoing President Donald Trump said in a statement there “will be an orderly transition” of power, shortly after Congress confirmed President-elect Joe Biden’s win.

> * Economists expect an increase in initial jobless claims, when the Labor Department reports its weekly numbers at 8:30 a.m. ET. With the seven-day average of new daily U.S. Covid infections spiking to a record high, first-time filings for unemployment benefits are seen rising by 28,000 to 815,000 for the week ended Jan. 2.

> * Ahead of Friday’s government employment report, the ADP’s look at December jobs trends at U.S. companies showed a contraction in private-sector positions for the first time since the early days of the coronavirus. Throughout most of the pandemic, the ADP estimates have been below the final government count.

*****

> # 2. 10-year Treasury yield above 1%; bitcoin above $38,000

> * The 10-year Treasury yield remained above 1% on Thursday morning after projected wins for Democrats in both Senate runoff elections in Georgia. Lightening up on bonds, pushing prices down and yields up, investors bought riskier assets like stocks and bitcoin.

> * The world’s largest cryptocurrency smashed through the $38,000 mark to hit a record high on Thursday as it continued its massive rally. Bitcoin has been up about 29% in the first days of 2021 and is up 380% over the past 12 months.

*****

> # 3. Congress confirms Biden as next president

> * Congress early Thursday confirmed the Electoral College vote for Biden, a day after Trump supporters breached the Capitol in a chaotic effort to avoid the formal recognition that the president lost the election. Shortly after the confirmation, White House spokesman Dan Scavino tweeted Trump’s statement, which promised “an orderly transition on January 20th,” the day of Biden’s inauguration, but also perpetuated the baseless claim that he actually won.

> * Congress’ process of counting Electoral College votes was interrupted Wednesday afternoon when rioters stormed the U.S. Capitol building. A woman who was among the invaders was shot and killed by Capitol Police. Three other people died from medical emergencies.

*****

> # 4. U.S. trade group asks Pence to ‘seriously consider’ invoking 25th Amendment

> * The National Association of Manufacturers, a trade organization representing 14,000 U.S. companies, called on Vice President Mike Pence to “seriously consider” invoking the 25th Amendment of the Constitution to remove Trump from office. Jay Timmons, CEO of the manufacturers group, is a former executive director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. Two Democratic U.S. representatives worked on a letter to Pence requesting he invoke the amendment.

> * Members of Trump’s Cabinet issued harsh rebukes of the violence that unfolded at the Capitol. The officials, however, stopped short of criticizing the president, who had urged his supporters to take action at a pro-Trump rally Wednesday morning.

> * An administration official confirmed to CNBC’s Eamon Javers that National Security Advisor Robert O’Brien and Deputy National Security Advisor Matthew Pottinger are considering resigning over the insurrection. Stephanie Grisham, chief of staff for first lady Melania Trump, and Sarah Matthews, White House deputy press secretary, both resigned Wednesday.

> * Mick Mulvaney, Trump’s former chief of staff, announced on CNBC on Thursday he is resigning as special envoy to Northern Ireland.

*****

> # 5. Democrats win the majority in the Senate

> * During the Capitol siege, Democrat Jon Ossoff was projected as the winner of the second of two Senate runoff elections Tuesday in Georgia. The defeat of Republican David Perdue, whose Senate term expired Sunday, coupled with Democrat Raphael Warnock’s projected victory over Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler, splits the 100 Senate right down the middle. However, Democrats take over the majority as Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would be the tie-breaking vote. After Biden’s inauguration, Democrats will control the Senate, House and the White House.

* Apple’s (AAPL) App Store platform grossed around $50 billion in 2019, according to analysis by CNBC. But growth is slowing. However, at $50 billion in annual sales App Store alone would be No. 64 on the Fortune 500, ahead of Cisco and behind Morgan Stanley.

"GDRX oversold due to extrinsic factors, bet on bounce back",9,jxcrsz,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jxcrsz/gdrx_oversold_due_to_extrinsic_factors_bet_on/,4,2020-11-20 03:55:49,"GDRX dropped 30% this week on news that Amazon is opening up an online pharmacy. CVS and WBA were both clobbered as well.

GDRX is oversold, just like ARCT was after PFE announced the vaccine. But, just like ARCT, everyone realized that its stupid to sell a stock just because someone else announced something. ARCT saw a bounce back because PFE's vaccine proves that mRNA treatment works. Now ARCT is back at $60 from a 50% drop.

GDRX will see the same bounce back, for similar reasons. Amazon validates their business model. GDRX also had their CEO go out today and explain how GDRX business model is better than Amazon's for prescription drugs:

https://www.benzinga.com/general/health-care/20/11/18448534/goodrx-ceo-says-theres-some-misunderstanding-of-amazons-pharmacy-offering

Bet on the bounce back!

I made two bets:

1. Total degenerate bet: Nov 20 2020 40 Call

2. Strategic bet: Dec 18 2020 40 Call

The volume on GDRX is back at IPO levels. I see this coming back to at least $50 in the next month."

### Introduction (again)

This is a primer about Valeant ($VRX). It will expire and become obsolete upon the release of updated Valeant financial statements, which could happen any day, though is supposed to happen before the 29th of April. *Right now, this is a guide into possibly taking advantage of the uncertainty around Valeant, which has depressed the stock.*

Valeant ($VRX) is probably the only time that I have seen [/r/investing](http://www.reddit.com/r/investing), [/r/wallstreetbets](http://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets), and buy side research like [Morningstar](http://www.morningstar.com/) actually agree with one another. Morningstar [rates it as 5 stars](http://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnys/vrx/quote.html) as of this release date (April 19, 2016). This is so infrequent that it is like having an alignment of the planets.

When I see overlapping worlds get excited, I immediately want to know the story. Over a weekend, I began pulling together all of the different sources and piecing together as much as I could in a limited amount of time.

It is not intended as a replacement for commentary by a CFA (which can be found [here](http://analysisreport.morningstar.com/stock/research?t=VRX&region=usa&culture=en-US&HID=QUO_STK118), (subscription required)), rather, it is a quick and dirty attempt to explain, in ordinary language, what the company does, how it makes money, who are the players involved, and what are some catalysts for its past fall and its future rise.

If you want to dig deeper and do more homework, this will kick it off. Use my work in addition to your own work or methods, and let's make some money. We are *all* trying to figure this one out before things are released, and where there's uncertainty, there's always opportunity.

### Thesis
My position is to buy before the catalysts. Once catalysts [mentioned here in Part 1: The Basics](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/4fbqyd/part_1_valeant_vrx_due_diligence_and_analysis/) start to happen, uncertainty will be removed. When uncertainty is removed through management changes, realignments of strategy, asset sales, cost cutting, etc., a depressed stock can have significant upward pressure.

###*2015-2016: Lots of Investors Balking in Little Time*

####**Five Big Catalysts for the Stock's Plunge**

Between 2015-2016, the stock plunged from $262/share (August 2015) to $33/share, where it is today (April 2016). That's an almost 90% loss. Morningstar's analyst, Michael Waterhouse, says [the stock's fair market value](http://analysisreport.morningstar.com/stock/research?t=VRX&culture=en-US&region=usa&HID=QUO_STK104) is worth $115/share. What happened?

There are many catalysts that seem to have happened at the same time to drop the price of the stock. Here are a few of the big ones that are often most discussed by journalists and bloggers.

As the thesis goes, when these catalysts have played themselves out and/or public opinion becomes disinterested, uncertainty is removed. When uncertainty is removed, VRX could have significant upward pressure.

**Reason 1: Pearson, Canny or Just Clueless?**

Valeant CEO J. Michael Pearson, as a result of his previous superstar performance, 2008-2014, was slow to fall out of favor with management. However, after [unplanned margin call stock sales to support his lifestyle](http://www.forbes.com/sites/nathanvardi/2016/04/13/valeant-pharmaceuticals-prescription-for-disaster/#3cc89d226c65)), publicity about [donating to charities but never paying](http://www.forbes.com/sites/nathanvardi/2016/04/13/valeant-pharmaceuticals-prescription-for-disaster/#3cc89d226c65)), and a [disastrous earnings and guidance call in March](http://www.fiercepharma.com/financials/activist-ackman-vows-to-intervene-after-disastrous-day-at-valeant), among other things, Pearson burned through investor patience quickly.

*Takeaway:* Any Valeant investor should know that the people who have invested previously are angry at the outgoing bad management for the volatility and will tend to be negative about management until less volatility in management and less volatility in results can be delivered.

We'll cover Pearson in a bit.

**Reason 2: Martin Shkreli Goes Viral**

Shkreli was an employee of television host [Jim Cramer's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Cramer) old firm [Cramer, Berkowitz, and Co.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Shkreli#Career) when he first caught the ire of the SEC for shorting biotech. He began a pharma portfolio company in 2011, [Retrophin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Shkreli#Retrophin), though was fired in 2014 and began the now-infamous Turing Pharmaceuticals.

In 2015, Shkreli went viral as the pharma exec who acquired and boosted the price of an HIV drug, Daraprim, by more than 5,556%. Going viral for raising the price of a drug launched him into the public eye and put him at the center of the American Healthcare Proxy Fight, described below, which then sucked in Valeant along with him.

Shkreli went from being unknown to being the [""most hated man in America""](http://qz.com/576554/martin-shkreli-the-ceo-who-jacked-up-prices-on-an-hiv-drug-was-arrested-this-morning/). In some ways, his own actions made this worse. When brought before a Congressional Hearing, Shkreli pleaded the fifth and tweeted that [politicians are imbeciles](http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2016/02/04/martin-shkreli-congressional-testimony-turing-pharmaceuticals-valeant-fda-drug-prices/79808004/).

The most remarkable thing about Shkreli, despite all of the bad press about him, is that he has a growing fan base. His self-produced YouTube channels [featuring him doing tutorials in finance](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8gjB1PSXv_oAUSAQ16S0fA/videos) have earned him praise. 

Shkreli has tweaked his media image, eventually coming to the conclusion that being transparent and accessible to the public through these tutorials could begin to change public opinion. His students may not all understand the business of pharma like he does, but they do get an understanding of the person behind the media. 

*Takeaway:* Any Valeant investor should pay attention to how quickly public opinion can change through transparency.

**Reason 3: Ongoing American Healthcare Proxy Fight**

The American healthcare system is arguably in need of a lot of help. The affordability of healthcare for aging Baby Boomers has been a critical issue for years. On the other end of the age spectrum, struggling younger people (Millennials, Generation X) want reform because their expenses are also very high. The game involves a lot of power changing hands between a lot of powerful people, so it is no surprise that, aside from [Obamacare](https://www.healthcare.gov/), little progress has been made in decades.

This battle has been raging for a half century, and is often used as a [proxy fight](
http://www.truth-out.org/opinion/item/8082-the-healthcare-battle-will-be-a-proxy-fight-of-divisions-in-american-politics) for stakeholders behind the scenes. Political parties, corporations, and everyone with a stake in how healthcare is regulated are all involved, and things get very dirty very quickly when public opinion is stoked.

A typical scenario is that politicians try to tackle the problem [through the use of public shame](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/02/04/pharma-bro-martin-shkreli-faces-congress-today-but-pledges-silence/) of CEOs or companies to influence public opinion, as a sort of substitute for actually working together and introducing legislation to fix the system. 

In contrast, Big Pharma fights back by influencing public opinion that government bureaucrats will only make things a lot worse and hinder improvements. One famous example was when then-First Lady Hillary Clinton [fought for healthcare reform in the 1990s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinton_health_care_plan_of_1993) and was subject to significant amounts of lambasting in the media by the pharma industry with [year-round television advertisements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_and_Louise).

The point being, while the amount of outrage present during election years is often higher than normal, this fight has been going on for a very long time and occasionally flares up.

*Takeaway:* Any Valeant investor should understand that anger at American pharma tends to be cyclical -- a proxy war between two powerful factions -- and the public loses interest quickly once actual details emerge.

**Reason 4: An American Presidential Election**

As a side note to American Healthcare, there is an American presidential election happening currently. Politicians have been using [populism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populism), including outrage at established industries by candidates Trump and Sanders, as part of their platform.

Despite Hillary Clinton's favorable reception with Wall Street ([Wall Street believes she will be the next president](http://www.cnbc.com/2016/04/06/wall-st-is-pretty-certain-who-will-be-president.html)), Mrs. Clinton [singled out Valeant](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/fff89b8e-c922-11e5-be0b-b7ece4e953a0.html) because the price of the drug dihydroergotamine had risen 356%.

*Takeaway:* A Valeant investor should understand that the American presidential election will dominate the headlines until November 2016, and pharma is an easy target for politicians.

**Reason 5: 'Perfect Storm' of Balking**

When there is uncertainty in a company, the stock drops as investors balk and pull their money from the shares. As we continue on, it is worth noting that it doesn't matter what the actual story is:

- Anytime a company acquires significant debt, investors balk.
- Anytime accounting irregularities are even *mentioned*, investors balk. 
- Anytime an insider dumps a lot of shares, investors balk.
- Anytime management is suspected of having problems behind the scenes, investors balk. 
- Anytime management doesn't acknowledge something that appears real to the average investor, investors balk.

In the story of Valeant, there was a lot of balking going on in a very short amount of time, and that cumulative uncertainty dropped the stock.

*Takeaway:* A Valeant investor should understand that the nervousness and volatility around the company comes from balking so much in such a short amount of time.

####**Pearson Goes Off the Deep End**

Less than two years ago, Valeant's CEO, J. Michael Pearson, was an absolute superstar. Valeant had [returned in excess of 2,300%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Michael_Pearson#Career) since 2008. Yet, as the saying goes, a CEO is only as good as his or her last quarter. Pearson's downfall is often attributed to that superstar status becoming a little sloppy, a little arrogant, and a little distracted because of health issues. This led to a loss of control.

I've read a number of things condemning his lifestyle, his management, his compensation. A lot of it is overly negative and probably not true. We know he was absent for a while and hospitalized with pneumonia. We know he was in the wrong position at the wrong place during the wrong time when Martin Skreli was taunting the public. We know he likely approved using mail-order pharmacy Philidor to steer its customers toward more expensive, Valeant-made drugs. It could be anything or everything that made investor sentiment turn against him.

**The Superstar Gets Sloppy**

What's clear is Pearson was off his game. He started to buy things he couldn't afford. He would make donations to nonprofit foundations he couldn't actually pay for. He bought hi-rise real estate in Miami with money he didn't have. He would try to do things publicly to ""juice"" Valeant shares to try to get more money.

One lifestyle issue that ended up dropping the stock was when Pearson was borrowing money (""buying on margin"") and buying Valeant stock circa October, 2015. As anyone who has ever done this knows, this goes well until the stock sinks. When the stock drops beyond a certain point, the broker will perform a ""margin call"" and the investor must pay cash.

Goldman Sachs issued a margin call on his stock holdings in October, 2015. Pearson couldn't pay. When the client cannot pay, the broker sells stock to pay. However, as the CEO of a public company, this selloff would be broadcast for everyone to see.

Unable to pay the margin call, to take payment [Goldman Sachs forcibly liquidated 1.3 million of his shares](http://www.forbes.com/sites/nathanvardi/2016/04/13/valeant-pharmaceuticals-prescription-for-disaster/#3cc89d226c65). In the insider activity log, in fact, you can see where all this happened. [Pearson's shares were sold and things got real really quick](
http://insiders.morningstar.com/trading/insider-activity.action?t=VRX&region=usa&culture=en-US).

For a public company to have the CEO randomly selloff over a million shares, there's going to be repercussions and a shock to the system. Investors balk, asking, ""What's wrong?""

####**The CFO and Philidor**

A significant item of uncertainty swirls around the use of a mail-order pharmacy to fill prescriptions, [Philidor](http://www.philidorrxservices.com/). That relationship apparently made things complicated enough that Valeant's Annual Reports were delayed. As far as I can figure out, CFO Howard Schiller and possibly Pearson allowed Valeant to partner with Philidor for some prescriptions. It was Schiller, however, who ultimately took the heat for it and was fired.

The whole thing seems to have started out as an experiment where Valeant lent employees to Philidor for support. Eventually, things became too close, and Philidor started steering its customers away from cheaper generics and toward the more expensive Valeant brands.

It is worth noting that in some countries, particularly ones where the quality of generics is not trusted, this practice is acceptable. However, in American culture, this constitutes a conflict of interest in the public eye. Pharmacies should remain neutral.

**Philidor Dumped, Walgreen's Brought In**

This relationship was dropped in October last year after Martin Shkreli's story went viral and Valeant was launched into the public eye. A more proper (and palatable) relationship with a more traditional drug retailer, Walgreen's (Walgreens Boots Alliance ($WBA)), was formed.

Valeant threw Schiller under the bus publicly for the whole thing. Less so for the actual concept and more so because some of Valeant's deals had started to involve Schiller making decisions that were outside the realm of what he should have been making. Valeant says, generically, that he was fired for ""inappropriate conduct"". The CFO may have [had a conflict of interest](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-03-21/valeant-s-schiller-says-company-incorrect-about-conduct), but Schiller strongly denies any wrongdoing.

During the most recent earnings call, Pearson said that it is more important to move forward, noting that [""well over 90% of our doctors who [were] using Philidor are now using Walgreen's""](http://www.nasdaq.com/aspx/call-transcript.aspx?StoryId=3958769&Title=valeant-pharmaceuticals-vrx-ceo-michael-pearson-on-q4-2015-results-earnings-call-transcript).

####**Firing the Superstar**

On March 21, 2016, the Board announced the final decision that Pearson, regardless of his legendary status in making the company what it had become, would be fired.

At this point, Pearson overplayed his hand, creating more volatility for the stock and uncertainty: [he wouldn't leave](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-03-22/with-board-member-who-won-t-leave-valeant-is-at-mercy-of-bylaws). When that news was released, blogs were posting that the company was at the mercy of a rogue, out-of-control CEO.

It ultimately backfired for Pearson, because not only did he eventually lose his job, [he has been called to do a Congressional Hearing about raising the prices of pharmaceuticals](http://fortune.com/2016/03/28/valeants-ceo-testify-u-s-congressional-hearing/).

Thus, the Board (and by extension, the investors) eventually won. Pearson acquiesced and agreed to leave after a new CEO could be found.

Legendary hedge fund manager and shareholder activist Bill Ackman [took the CFO Schiller's place on the Board](http://www.valeant.com/about/board-of-directors), where he is today, becoming an active investor instead of a purely passive investor. Ackman will be discussed in the next installment.

*Takeaway:* Investors are betting that if the company can function reasonably with such volatile management, what it can do with good or even great management could be impressive.

####**Tomorrow: The Turnaround**
There has been a lot of discussion around legendary hedge fund manager Bill Ackman and how he bet a billion dollars on Valeant, rode it to the bottom, and will now turn it around. We will cover who he is, where he's going, and why this may be his best performance yet.

Buy pharmacies dip - likely oversold on Amazon PillPack acquisition,16,8ujskk,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/8ujskk/buy_pharmacies_dip_likely_oversold_on_amazon/,12,2018-06-28 19:43:54,"There's a pattern every time Amazon makes an acquisition or starts a joint venture in a new sector - existing companies plummet immediately and quickly recover.  
  
It happened a year or so ago with $COST - fell sharply on whole foods acquisition despite not being a direct competitor. Easy money buying the dip, since COST shouldn't have fallen so sharply.  
  
It happened more recently when $AMZN was reported to be starting a joint venture into health insurance. Look at the other health insurance companies now - they generally recovered quickly.  
  
I believe the same will occur now. $RAD is a shitshow so i wouldn't buy it specifically, but $WBA, $CVS, and others look pretty good.  
  
Also, its being reported on CNBC that PillPack can't currently sell schedule II substances. So no opioids, no adderall, etc. I don't really know enough about $AMZN's strategy here to evaluate their decision, but i'd assume it's good.  
  
But what i am fairly confident about is that other pharmacies will rebound within a few months, barring some unpredicted government/regulatory bullshit or a broader economic mess.  
  
Options not recommended because decline may potentially continue for a few weeks, hard to predict when they bottom out.  
  
Also, both appear to be on a downtrend, so i wouldn't go all in - just a secondary background play to consider.  
  
TL;DR: Buy the dip on $WBA, $CVS, and really any pharmacy stock other than $RAD. AMZN acquisition overhyped."

The company reported a third-quarter profit that beat analysts' estimates as a strengthening U.S. economy spurred demand for air travel, helping the airline raise ticket prices. The No.2 U.S. airline also forecast total unit revenue, a closely watched performance metric, to increase between 3 and 5 percent in the fourth quarter.

Deals Of The Day

• Apple Inc (AAPL). The company is buying the power-management technology at the heart of its iPhones in a $600 million deal with Dialog Semiconductor that also secures the German-listed company's role as a supplier to the U.S. tech giant. The agreement to acquire patents and people from the Anglo-German chip designer is not only unusual, but also the largest of its kind by Apple, whose last sizeable acquisition was the $350 million purchase of Face ID creator PrimeSense in 2013. After the deal, Dialog expects Apple to account for 35-40 percent of its total revenues in 2022. That is down from around 75 percent in the current year. Headcount will fall to 1,800.

• Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY) & Compugen (CGEN). Bristol-Myers Squibb and Israel's Compugen said they will collaborate in clinical trials for patients with advanced solid tumours. The trials will evaluate the safety and tolerability of Compugen’s COM701, an investigational antibody, in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb’s immune checkpoint inhibitor Opdivo. In conjunction with the collaboration, Bristol-Myers Squibb will invest $12 million in Compugen, purchasing 2,424,243 shares - equal to a 4.1 percent stake - at $4.95 each. The investment represents a 33 percent premium over the average closing price on the last 20 trading days and is expected to close on or about Oct. 12.

IPO

• Livent Corp (LTHM). The initial public offering of lithium producer Livent was priced at $17 per share on Wednesday, lead bookrunner Bank of America Merrill Lynch said, below a target range and giving the company a market value of $2.43 billion. The offering was to be priced between $18 and $20 per share, with the sale of 20 million shares raising $340 million. The shares will start trading on Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker 'LTHM'.

In Other News

• Boeing Co (BA). The company is building the largest rocket in NASA's history but the aerospace giant's ""poor performance"" has resulted in an $8.9 billion price tag that is double the initial budget and could further delay the launch, the U.S. space agency's watchdog office said on Wednesday. The first test launch of the Space Launch System rocket, which is supposed to send humans to the moon and ultimately allow deep space exploration, was most recently slated for mid-2020 with a crew launch to follow in 2022. The launches have been delayed at least three times.

• Citigroup Inc (C). A U.S. financial regulator is mulling sanctions against Citigroup for denying minority customers the kinds of mortgage discounts that the bank offered to many other borrowers, three people familiar with the probe told Reuters. While performing a review to ensure it adhered to fair lending standards, Citigroup found that some minority borrowers were not getting the discounts they were due under a program that gives a break on mortgage rates to customers who have large deposits or wealth in the hands of the bank, said the sources.

• Micron Technology (MU). The company said on Wednesday it planned to invest up to $100 million in startup companies working on artificial intelligence technologies for use in self-driving vehicles, factory automation and other growing fields. The memory chip maker launched a corporate venture capital program more than a decade ago, but its investments until now had been ""very sporadic"" and ""very close to our core business"" of making chips, Sumit Sadana, Micron's chief business officer, told Reuters. The newly earmarked funds will be invested in both hardware and software startups working on artificial intelligence, Sadana said.

• Murphy Oil Company (MUR). Brazil's state-controlled oil company Petroleo Brasileiro is forming a joint venture with the company to explore oil and gas fields in the Gulf of Mexico, the Brazilian company said on Wednesday in a securities filing. According to the filing, Petrobras, as the Brazilian company is known, will have a 20 percent stake in the joint venture, and Murphy will have 80 percent. Petrobras will receive $1.1 billion in the transaction, the filing added. Both companies will contribute with all their producing assets in the Gulf of Mexico for the joint venture. The joint venture will have a production of 75,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day during the fourth quarter, according to the filing.

• Sears Holdings Corp (SHLD). The company has started to miss payments to vendors, adding to concerns about its future after sources said on Wednesday that the U.S. department store operator was preparing to file for bankruptcy in the coming days. Three vendors told Reuters that Sears had missed scheduled payments to them in the last couple of weeks. It was not immediately clear how widespread the issue was and how it would affect Sears' supply chain ahead of the holiday shopping season. Vendors could stop shipments if they are worried Sears cannot pay, potentially sending the retailer into freefall.

• Tesla Inc (TSLA). The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Tesla and Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk submitted a joint filing late on Wednesday in support of a settlement, saying the terms were in the best interest of investors. Musk agreed to pay a $20 million fine, and step aside as Tesla's chairman for three years, to settle charges that could have forced his exit from Tesla. The company also accepted a $20 million fine, despite not being charged with fraud."

Walgreens: Tendies on the horizon,12,9lk314,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/9lk314/walgreens_tendies_on_the_horizon/,5,2018-10-05 12:39:59,"Disclaimer: I work at store level and am inebriated

&#x200B;

\- Why do I believe that there will be a chance to make any tendies off of $WBA? 

Recently had to take a slap on the wrist from the SEC and also just gave all lower level clerks a raise to $10/hr ([est. cost of 100 million against the 350 million tax savings coming with the tax cuts](http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-walgreens-pay-increase-0329-story.html)). On Nov. 4 this year the plan to revamp their rewards program to make it less enticing to what I would describe as super shoppers or just customers who take full advantage of any and all rewards they can earn or redeem. The one big change that is coming is the fact that the max rewards you can cash in on one transaction are currently 50 bucks and the new ones will be 5 bucks in on transaction. Over the long term I do not think this will prove to be a bad move but these two things combined with the big headlines will lead to big swings in the price esp closing in on 3\\19 which is when they should be reporting their earnings for the FQ that ends in 2/19 if the schedule is similar to last year. The reason I believe this will cause some movement is because for the most part $WBA is rated on the greener end of meh by most analysts and these changes will effect what I consider to be the two big ""sentiment"" factors in retail being operation costs and id sales/same store sales/yoy sales. Underneath I will include more pros/cons and my eventual yolo play:

&#x200B;

Pros:

* Annual rev. growth beats industry avg
* Insiders are buying more than they are selling currently
* The margins they make on generics are large and the % they sell is going up over time
* Took on a ton of debt in 2015 and since then are efficiently handling it
* CVS is dumb and runs their operation like ass (pure opinion)
* Customer service is a legit core value and definitely shows throughout the brand 

Cons:

* They aren't necessarily doing ""great"" by any measure/metric
* In q1 2018 they said that they were trying to increase front-end sales but from what I see a few of their policies lack any real understanding of what it takes to grow their front-end sales
* While the boots part of the alliance isn't large Europe is a dumpster fire right now
* The above reason I listed will more than likely cause problems with customer retention in the near future
* There is a ton of negative feedback coming from the store level employees about the proposed rewards changes
* one of the ways they are trying to counteract the wage increase is by lowering P.T.O. rates for employees 

If anyone has any arguments agai4/nst/for I would like to hear them.

&#x200B;

My planned yolo: Either buy puts or sell calls for 4/19 will edit with position after I finish watching my Visa uppies crash and burn "

$RAD - buyout speculation,4,612uq5,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/612uq5/rad_buyout_speculation/,8,2017-03-23 21:49:31,"Rumors of a buyout by Walgreens, anyone in buying into this? I dropped ~$2k (420 shares!) on this. Who else is with me?

Link: http://investorplace.com/2017/03/why-deutsche-bank-ag-usa-db-rite-aid-corporation-rad-and-kohls-corporation-kss-3-of-todays-worst-stocks/#.WNPyiBLysUE

Rite Aid Corporation (RAD)
Last but not least, the sordid saga of the attempt by Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (NASDAQ:WBA) to acquire rival Rite Aid continues to twist and turn, dragging RAD down to the tune of 2.9%. That dip earned the stock a spot on the daily 'Worst 3' list for a second time this month.

It has been an adventure to say the least. Walgreens Boots Alliance announced its intentions in 2015, but has bumped into several regulatory roadblocks in the meantime. Walgreens' M.O. has been a vow to shed more stores than initially planned to secure a green light from an understaffed Federal Trade Commission. But, each store Walgreens doesn't buy from Rite Aid lowers the value of RAD shares. The company reportedly willing to buy the stores Walgreens can't, Fred's, Inc. (NASDAQ:FRED), may not be as generous as Walgreens Boots Alliance was going to be … if a deal gets done at all."

$RAD,14,4o2rod,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/4o2rod/rad/,7,2016-06-14 23:39:30,"Earnings on Thursday before market opens.

Currently at $7.825

This weeks $8 call is $0.08

Previous highs of $8.20 - $9.50

Easy intrinsic value of $0.20 - $1.50 if it lands anywhere in that range. For you autists/faggots that is 250% -  1875% 

My DD is that I buy my beer at Rite Aid and always have to wait in line for like 10 mins + to check out. 

They cant be paying their employees much either because they all look like they hate their jobs.

"CVS, RAD, WAB - AMZN porn based analysis",5,8ujfhj,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/8ujfhj/cvs_rad_wab_amzn_porn_based_analysis/,2,2018-06-28 19:01:25,"Suffering from an inferiority complex and unable to compete with her hotter sisters WBA and CVS in looks alone, RAD sought attention in other ways. It started with kissing booths and moved quickly beyond, she would earn a reputation for being easy and convenient. But it was hard for anyone in her school to satisfy her.

She had her eyes on a guy that her sisters were seeing on and off. Jealousy bubbled up whenever she would hear their orgasm induced screams from all night sessions. The whole town's women tremble when his name is uttered. The exagerrated reputation Amazon had was part of his deadly charm. Some say his thrust has enough power to get to low earth orbit, some say he has traveled the world and knows 40 languages, others say he could guarantee satisfaction within 48 hours. Either way, curiosity was getting to the best of her and so she plotted a way for their paths to cross.

One night, after her sister was throughly exhausted in another session, she positioned herself near the door way in nothing but a towel. As the door opened, she gasped at the sight of a giant of a man. Standing at 7 feet tall with bulging muscles all over and a staff the size of an arm, she nearly orgasmed simply from his towering figure. Without a word, Amazon grappled her by the throat and forced his enormous manhood down her mouth. Holding back her tears, RAD felt her gag reflex kick in immediately and her own cough being clogged by the newly formed air seal. As he slides his member back and fourth, she felt her consciousness fading in and out. They would find her lifeless body the next day with a large amount of rectal trauma and bleeding."

Monday:

**A. Schulman, Inc. (SHLM)** <-- these guys are reporting Monday AH. They manufacture tires/resins/etc. Expecting a beat on lower commodity prices. I am a buyer of 50 or 55C april.

Tuesday: 

**Dave & Buster's (PLAY)** <-- No opinion. Straddles might be fun. I think they might miss EPS based on consumer sentiment and market volatility/unsureness in October 2014.

[reserved for outcome]


**Greenbrier Companies (GBX)** <-- I am bullish on manufacturing, idk if it will be necessarily reflected in this equity. Could surprise. No position.

Wednesday



**ALCOA (AA)** <-- Needs no introduction. I believe we rally even if AA misses estimates. Looking for other opinions.

**Bed Bath Beyond (BBBY)** <-- A lot of big boys in this. There are some long positions taken this week hedged with ATM puts and some speculation in calls. Worth keeping an eye on.

Good time to short?,0,3e3kvk,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/3e3kvk/good_time_to_short/,0,2015-07-21 23:43:11,"Here's what I think: The SPY hit its high point yesterday (212 pts) and it's looking like it will move down in the future, dragging stocks down with it. The exception is if we have a great earnings quarter, in which case the SPY will stay high or might even go up a bit. I think this is unlikely and the SPY will move down in the short term. It's been around the 205-213 range for a while.

With this info, I'm looking for some overvalued stocks to short. Not FB or UA as they're going into their earnings and the hype will keep these stocks strong. Maybe something like WBA which looks like it's peaking after it's earnings beat and might start to slip. I'll wait another day for confirmation on WBA. Apple's earnings could lift the entire S&P tomorrow.

Do you guys have any other suggestions for stocks to short?"
