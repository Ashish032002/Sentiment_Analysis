QCOM Thesis,28,1aippe6,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1aippe6/qcom_thesis/,51,2024-02-04 20:28:30,"I have been watching the AI hardware game play out, and I my theory is that Qualcomm is ridiculously under valued vs other AI hardware providers. 

Qualcomm's latest offerings on device are powerful enough to do some really interesting things on device as we can see with the S24 ultra. All of a sudden phones can begin to do more locally vs just being a portal into the internet. 

I think more interestingly, Qualcomm is in theory about to come into desktop computing in a big way with the x elite desktop chip. I get it if people think Qualcomm has no room for growth on phones because they are already top dog, but they could potentially completely destroy intel and amd in the laptop and potentially desktop market. Apples m chips are ridiculously better then anything intel or apple can throw at laptops without paying insane gamer money, and the x elite will prolly be the same, which btw Microsoft is betting on with windows 12. Imagine if Microsoft starts to depend on x elite for copilot???

Next up you have their ai 100 inference cards, which seem to be ridiculously good at doing cost effective inference. From what I can tell, they have all been snapped up by large cloud providers and they most likely didn't produce enough, and hopefully they are ramping up production. 

So, these guys dominate phones with the best stuff, Microsoft is making windows 12 compatible with arm architecture for the first time ever and they have the first and only option (and it looks like it will be hands down better in both general computing and ai workloads then what's on the market). And to top it off they have a credible line of ai inference server cards that are selling like hotcakes.

What on earth is going on with their stock price? You have to really think people think xelite and server inference hardware will be literally worthless to have the current valuation. These guys are coming for nvidia, intel,  and amds pie and they have a really credible shot at taking a huge slice of their traditional market and the new ai stuff. X elite alone is enough to bankrupt intel."

https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qw9glx/im_surprised_there_isnt_more_nvda_talk_before/

I was playing golf at my club and guys who were 60+ on the tee box were talking nvda and smci and everything they said was wrong.  Then I walked into the restaurant to eat and again I heard the boomer pro talking about it. Funny thing was I remember him dogging on it when it was sub 200 having too high a PE

I had a plan and my limit order sold at 900 awhile back but when my mom asked about NVDA I just had that sinking feeling like she asked my about my decentralized currency when it hit ath but my limit order had not filled .  I remember her asking about my currency around nov 2021 at thanksgiving which was literally the top, and again at thxgiving or christmas years prior in 2013 and 2017 she again called the top.

Bless her but my mom and boomers have a way of warning about the top.

EDIT: I just think it‚Äôs way harder for a company like NVDA which owns 99% of datacenter GPU to keep that 99% and I already seeing AMD, QCOM, ARM, AMZN, MSFT, GOOG, Meta making their own and making in roads and chipping 1% here and there.  

Much like any IT person who worked in datacenters and colocations pre 2016 saw INTC own 99% of datacenter.  It was easy to see it‚Äôs very hard to keep 99% and when you lose a few % the ‚Äústreet‚Äù or ‚Äúmarket‚Äù pivots quickly.  

5+ years ago I said AMD at $1.80 I said INTC would start shedding that 99% dominance.  

https://np.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/9v1n6f/amazon_web_services_aws_pricing_amd_vs_intel/e994dka/

When you own 99% of the market imo once the pivot happens, it‚Äôs almost like a landslide in stock price. And it moves in cycles, companies will buy a bunch of NVDA GPUs and they might add a little bit the next year or the year after but you won‚Äôt have large purchases.  No one is buying 1 billion dollars of GPUs every year or quarter.  This business cycles and when it goes down it‚Äôll go down for 2 years and rocket up after when people need to bulk order."

Why its time for $QCOM,59,1arcdvv,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1arcdvv/why_its_time_for_qcom/,28,2024-02-15 15:49:45,"Fellow degenerates,

Qualcomm (QCOM) already is a huge established player in the mobile chip market - it pretty much has a monopoly if you ignore Apple. Their P/E ratio is 21.40 in comparison to AMD's 88 and Nvidia's 93. It's fucking cheap. But I hear you think, who cares about these mobile phone chips with their gimmicky AI features.

No one is talking about the following, and I think Qualcomm can be a gem. So besides them being already established in the phone market, nobody is talking about the following:

**1.** **Qualcomm shaking up the CPU market**

Qualcomm is about to turn the Windows CPU market into its personal playground. It's going to be bringing ARM chips (yes, the technology that made Apple's M chips insanely superior over these shitty windows chips as they are so much more expensive). No one wants to walk around with these fugly thick windows laptops, Qualcomm is going to be the first one to change it and will have the first mover advantage. Even if they dont win the market, the market is growing insanely fast and is huge (the pie is big enough..). Qualcomm has good connections with TSMC (who produces their / apples chips).. It's a nobrainer.

I did the math on another post, simply comparing benchmarks shows that they have  a fair shot at apple's M3. Meaning - thin windows laptops with insane increases in battery life. No more jet engine sounds.

**2. Inference chips (actually a contender for nvidia.. and nobody is talking about this)**

You have AI 100 cards, which do the actual AI heavy lifting (and not the bullshit gimmicky phone AI stuff) in AI/data centers. They are making the AI 100 Ultra. It's a serious contender for nvidia's H100 and benchmark info is available online.

**3. The AI hype potential**

Besides all the prior I mentioned, it being underpriced, already fundamentally a good company but also going to singlehandedly turn the windows laptops (and desktop) market upside down.. in addition to competing with nvidia in the AI inference world.. 

It's prone to being hyped up if this nvidia crazyness continues. People will be looking for the next nvidia - and this is a great contender.

The company's $9.39 billion in revenue, an 11.1% year-over-year increase, demonstrated robust demand for its products, which are crucial in 5G, IoT, autonomous driving, and AI-driven data center applications.

The adjusted operating income of $3.02 billion, a 2.2% beat, highlighted Qualcomm's efficiency in navigating the cyclical semiconductor landscape. Non-GAAP earnings per share rose to $2.33, a 3.3% improvement over the same quarter last year, reflecting the company's strong financial performance.

Qualcomm's optimism for the future is evident in its Q3 guidance, with revenue projected at $9.9 billion, a 2% increase above analyst estimates.¬†

Non-GAAP EPS guidance for the quarter stands at $2.55, also above market expectations. These figures indicate that the company is well-positioned to capitalize on ongoing technological advancements.

The inventory management picture was mixed, with Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO) at 131 days, which is higher than the five-year average by 26 days. While this suggests a temporary increase in inventory, it could be an indication of a potential tightening in supply or heightened demand, depending on the company's strategic planning.¬†

A decline in DIO from the previous quarter implies that Qualcomm is taking steps to manage its inventory more efficiently.

The stock market responded positively to the earnings report, with Qualcomm's shares trading up 6.3% to $192.17 post-release. This rally underscores investor confidence in the company's growth prospects, particularly as it continues to navigate the opportunities in the 5G and AI-driven tech sectors.

As a fabless manufacturer, Qualcomm's long-term success is tied to broader tech trends and consumer demand. With a market capitalization of $186.3 billion, the company is well-equipped to leverage its innovation and maintain its position at the forefront of wireless technology.¬†

However, investors should remain aware that semiconductor cycles can be cyclical, and periods of growth may be followed by contractions, offering potential entry points for long-term investors."

And then this shitstorm happened. The highway is clogged, ships are standing loaded with crap they cannot effectively unload quick enough, there aren\`t enough ships to move products that are needed. Including basic materials for industries and intermediate components to make a final product.

For those who don\`t know, there is an absolute chip shortage in the market right now. Spanning from AMD/NVDA CPUs and GPUs, to auto chips, to new consoles, and any kind of electronics. Even AAPL will have sales issues this quarter caused by the chip shortage.

The main chip producer TSMC is ramping up CAPEX to $28 billion, including $12 bn for their US plant.

The perfect storm is brewing for NVDA and AMD to gain enormously from this market, but in my opinion AMD will end up with upper hand, let me explain.

&#x200B;

1. Back in 2017/2018 year old GPUs were selling over on Amazon and elsewhere for double their MSRP. These were old graphic cards! their price should have depreciated over time, but didn\`t. Why? Cause of B T C. Miners were buying that shit by bulks. Guess what? We\`re at the exact same situation right now, except that price of that thingy is now $50k! and with new cards being more cost effective you wouldn\`t be able to buy ANY right now even if you wanted it to simply upgrade your PC and play something. As a matter of fact try to buy GTX 10xx or RTX 20xx gen on Amazon, there are NONE! So its not only the latest gen that\`s unavailable, its ALL of them. And CPUs have the exact same problem, which wasn\`t so bad in 2018. And soon you might find it impossible to buy even any laptop having latest chip: [https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/chinese-gpu-miners-reportedly-bulk-buying-nvidia-laptops-to-mine-ether-9787156](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/chinese-gpu-miners-reportedly-bulk-buying-nvidia-laptops-to-mine-ether-9787156)
2. Not long ago NVDA announced $40 bn acquisition of ARM which would ensure they have access to state of the art IP which would make them future chip behemoth, and not surprisingly the largest companies in the world are now lobbying against that [https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22280262/qualcomm-microsoft-google-nvidia-arm-acquisition-investigations-concerns](https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22280262/qualcomm-microsoft-google-nvidia-arm-acquisition-investigations-concerns) . With this in mind, its becoming increasingly likely the acquisition wont go through. On the other hand, AMD replied with the acquisition of XLNX which seems wouldn\`t be such an issue considering AMD is way smaller than NVDA or INTC.
3. AMD and QCOM are actively lobbying US gov to address the issue, which they will. What to expect? Quite likely to remove previous trade policies regarding chips - resulting in easier access and higher/cheaper volume of chips being produced overseas. Which would mean AMD can ramp up production and meet the huge current demand of data centers and whoever needs their GPU. [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-11/biden-team-pledges-aggressive-steps-to-address-chip-shortage](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-11/biden-team-pledges-aggressive-steps-to-address-chip-shortage) . 
4. Price action - stocks follow certain pattern. They kinda wobble within some range for long period of time, 6-18 months, this is where a lot of accumulation by big players happen, and fundamentals kind of crystalize. Once the conditions are right, the stock can shoot 50% in a span of a month and then hover on new level for considerable time. Look at the chart of TSLA 2015-2019, NVDA numerous times, AMZN, GOOG, etc. Right now, NVDA is up already 20% in the last month. I believe the market will look from NVDA to AMD very soon, given points 2-3 and major holders wont be willing to sell for current price.

To recap what is the perfect storm. In 2017/18 chip shortage was caused mainly by A. the thing we dont mention here, right now its also B. new consoles cant be produced fast enough, C. supply chain issues which might be resolved soon, C. simply way bigger improvement in new CPUs/GPUs hence new upgrade cycle coupled with corporate upgrade cycle due to COVID

The level of commitment and effort invested in providing insights to benefit countless individuals does not receive the recognition it deserves. In just a month, I've made half my yearly income since I've begun options trading. While I've encountered my fair share of setbacks along the way, the guidance provided by these DDs (and comments) has empowered me to make more informed decisions and recover. It's truly remarkable to live in an era where an average Joe like myself can work an extra full-time job and profit from the markets. The majority of us would not have been able to do this 5-10 years ago on our own. Thank you, gentlemen, for your invaluable contributions!

The chipmaker is often regarded as one of the greatest beneficiaries of the AI revolution. Is Nvidia stock a buy after breaking over a critical level on Monday, with earnings anticipated later this week?

Nvidia is scheduled to disclose its fiscal second-quarter earnings on Wednesday, following a quarter of stellar performance and outsized AI-driven guidance. Analysts at KeyBanc, HSBC, and Baird have boosted their price targets on Nvidia stock, joining over ten other Wall Street firms in doing so in the last week. Wall Street is looking to Nvidia's guidance for 2023 and 2024 to determine the underlying demand and growth direction of AI spending. Nvidia revealed its next-generation AI super processor, the GH200, in August, with the goal of targeting the expanding generative AI sector.

https://preview.redd.it/29fls97fqmjb1.png?width=802&format=png&auto=webp&s=65dbb63bb7176bbd921f465bb6bed48b1708cd41

Despite the stock market's ""in correction"" position, Nvidia has outperformed growth equities in general. On August 21, the relative strength line reached a new high, and Nvidia joined the renowned IBD Leaderboard in February due to an earnings gap-up. Nvidia stock has risen more than 221% year to far, reaching a 52-week high on July 14. Nvidia receives an IBD Composite Rating of 96 out of a maximum of 99, putting it in the top 4% of all companies in terms of technical and fundamental indicators. Investors should prioritize stocks with Comp Ratings of 90 or above.

Nvidia, situated in Santa Clara, California, has issued a bullish, AI-fueled sales projection for the first quarter, earning $1.09 per share on sales of $7.19 billion. Despite a 20% year-on-year reduction in profitability and a 13% drop in revenue, the company's results exceeded Wall Street's forecasts. Sales of data centers increased 14% to $4.28 billion, while sales of gaming chips decreased 38% to $2.24 billion. Analysts now predict that Nvidia's earnings will increase 148% this year, while sales will increase 65%. Nvidia's history includes developing graphics processing units (GPUs) to improve the realism of video games, extending into AI chips used in supercomputers, data centers, and medication discovery, and working on ""supercomputers"" that combine its own CPUs and GPUs. Nvidia chips are also employed in cryptocurrency mining and self-driving electric vehicles. The fabless category is ranked 21st out of 197 industry groups, with competitors such as QCOM, Broadcom, and Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR).

## Is Nvidia Stock A Buy?

Because of brisk chip sales for data centers and artificial intelligence, Nvidia's earnings are likely to more than double this fiscal year. The business is moving into automated electric vehicles and cloud gaming, and the adoption of the metaverse and cryptocurrencies might increase demand for Nvidia chips even further. However, macroeconomic uncertainty and the potential of a worldwide recession continue to exist. Nvidia stock has nearly tripled by 2023, but the AI chip leader's earnings later this week, as well as overall market conditions, should be taken into account before making any fresh investments.

QCOM has won its bid to overturn an antitrust fine of 997 million euros (1Billy US) from  the European Union related to its sale of 4G modems to Apple.

The U.S. Supreme Court has declined to hear APPL bid to invalidate two QCOM patents given the past global settlement between the two companies.

QCOM reported very strong fiscal 2Q22 sales and adjusted EPS and projected a strong fiscal 3Q.

JPOW & Committee has no reason at all to do six rate cuts this year so far.  Too bad - the economy would boom otherwise.  He won‚Äôt declare victory and most likely will remain cautious.  I think the market needs to get over the Fed and move on.    

Tuesday the fun begins:

MSFT -  red hot!   The tunes are full blast - can they dance?   They have three businesses to report on plus AI.  Microsoft 365, Asure cloud, & personal computing- XBOX, Bing, Surface, and Activision.  Their yoy earnings is expected to increase 19%.  They been pushing AI close to two years now - show me the money!  Would like to see  yoy revenue growth of at least 25% based on their price. I think they are over bought.  

GOOGL -  is expected to grow earnings by 53% to roughly $ 1.61.  Let‚Äôs see how search and YouTube does.  Maybe they have a new AI story to tell.  Over bought I think.   

AMD -  is expected to grow earnings by 12% to roughly $0.77.   It‚Äôll be about forward guidance I believe.   I like what I hear about the 8000G processors with lower power graphics and innovative content creation capabilities.   They have a strong story as well with their neural processing unit(NPU) Ryzen A for PC‚Äôs. Over bought but will continue to kick ass I think.

Thursday:

AAPL - is expected to grow earnings 12% with flat yoy revenue.  Really don‚Äôt see any surprise to the upside.  Heard the Apple Pro Vision isn‚Äôt gaining any app‚Äôs on Netflix‚Äôs.    Really no growth story so far.  Sell. 

AMZN -big Q upcoming.   They need to demonstrate they can make big money.  They are expected to grow earnings from $0.03 to 0.79/share.  Use them a lot - we‚Äôll see.

Meta - expected to grow earnings by 66% to $5 roughly.  Meta plans to have 350,000 Nvidia H100 chips to drive its data centers & AI by end of 2024. Year of efficiency is over I think.

\*(According to Tradingview)

We already know that FB and Microsoft have benefitted from conferencing and everyone staying home during the lockdowns despite both (more the former than the later) having drops earlier this month.

So the earnings will be up (not that if they were negative it would change much) **so it's a very important thing to consider as the stock prices will likely go up.**

We already knew of the Qualcomm news with apple and factories in china starting to re-open production, will likely have a decent earnings which means the price will go up.

TSLA is arguably a scam stock depending on who you talk to, but puts rarely if ever, work on it, and it continues to climb. If there is a bubble to pop it won't be happening until it hits around or near $1000 per share.

***SPY was already up pre-market and continued climbing throughout the day today despite higher unemployment numbers, more business closures, and GDP contraction.***

All 5 will receive an ***additional benefit*** due to Dr.Jerome's **FED Promise Gurantee**, which will involve the fed continuing to pump money into the economy, help banks and larger corporations, and will be purchasing more junk bonds, along with other manipulation tactics.

This means that if you go in on all 5 of these with calls there is a 89% chance you will be ranking in massive dow either by the end of tomorrow trading day or until the end of Fridays trading day.

**Never before has such a tsunami of money been (Potentially) on the table for free.** The only wild card is how much TSLA will climb, but you could remove that risk and still have a safe money making bet regardless.

There's an outstanding $880 million fine that Qualcomm most likely will lose (they were fined for the exact same reason by China 2 years ago), and the results come out July 20th as well.

Keep close watch of Qualcomm, watch that shit tank after the lawsuit's results are released tomorrow, and then pick up as many shares as you can. They're going to absolutely wreck earnings."

The legitimate case for $QCOM.,13,n9unle,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n9unle/the_legitimate_case_for_qcom/,13,2021-05-11 16:47:35,"-QCOM trades at 22x earning when most of the S&P trades at 38.

-QCOM is down 20% from its high back in Feb after it BEAT earnings and revenue estimates.

-QCOM BEAT earnings and revenue estimates 2 weeks ago and has not seen any sustained gains.

-The most recent 5G cell cycles is not even close to over as most 5G users are still predominantly in developed countries.

-QCOM‚Äôs bread and butter business is from royalties which contributes up to 60% of revenue. This is generally a stable and predictable stream.

-QCOM‚Äôs biggest opportunity is in connected automobiles and autonomous driving which is expected to explode in the next 5 years.

-It was announced Apple, QCOM‚Äôs biggest customer will be developing their own chips. Fine, QCOM develops the technology behind the chips and doesn‚Äôt really produce much as they rely on 3rd parties for production. Again, QCOM is basically a patent troll and could still/likely will collect on royalties even if Apple does produce/engineer their own chip.

At a less than 22 P/E ratio, I‚Äôm really not sure what better value you would find for a company so well positioned in tech, for AI, 5G, Semiconductors, and the future Internet of Things..."

$QCOM gets sued by $AAPL and shits the bed in January. Drops over 20% to ~$52 (a HUGE drop for this stock, since it's not really volatile and has very small moves on regular days, 86% institutional ownership). It recovers slowly but steadily over the next couple of months, gaining 11% and almost touching $60. After that, they have a not-so stellar ER and guidance for obvious reasons ($AAPL not paying the royalties), but only drop slightly, and still hover around $57-$58 range. 

Then another whammy, $BBRY (a garbage company that should be burned to the ground) gets gifted $900m in an arbitration decision VS $QCOM, so the stock drops like a rock to $51-$52 about a month ago. Since then, it has again recovered and gained 10% yet again and is approaching $58. 

$QCOM has shown a tremendous ability to bounce back from lows and establish considerable support along the way. They are also in the process of acquiring $NXPI which would substantially increase their scope of business (Friday night they announced an $11.0 Billion unsecured senior notes offering - rated by the S&P as ""A"" - in part to fund the acquisition). 

They are also suing the manufacturers of $AAPL products that were ordered to not pay the royalties to $QCOM. AND they are attempting to stop the import of IPhones into the US by filing a motion with the International Trade Commission. A bold move, to say the least.

In short, the potential for gains in this scenario is huge. Is it risky play? Yes. Does it have potential for massive returns? Yes. Does it have potential for massive losses? Yes. But, gentlemen, isn't this what we do?

TLDR; I'm buying $2,000 worth of Jan 19, 2018 $70 strike calls tomorrow. Godspeed, boys. "

Buy QCOM Leaps 2020 (DD inside).,18,9f2w4x,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/9f2w4x/buy_qcom_leaps_2020_dd_inside/,19,2018-09-12 05:52:12,"[My last DD on AVGO](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/9blptm/buy_avgo_calls_jan_or_anything_further_out/) went well, but I was also dumb enough to dump most of [my RH play money into MU Jan 50c's](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/9eyty7/mu_literal_hindu_prayer_thread/) so take whatever I am saying with a metric ton of salt.

QCOM is basically a tech monopoly, but our politicians are too dumb to understand how email works let alone wireless technologies. 

QCOM is very unique in that they are the worlds most successful patent licensing firm and a semi con. QCOM has two distinct Business units that account for most of their revenues. QCT (Qualcomm CDMA Technologies) which sells most of the chips (think snapdragon etc.) and QTL (Qualcomm Technology Licensing) which is the BU that rakes in all the licensing dollars.

&#x200B;

QCOM has been sued by everyone and their mom (Apple being the biggest one) for predatory pricing and monopolistic practices with regards to the royalty payments made to QTL. **Any resolution in these lawsuit is in fact a net positive for Qualcomm, particularly the Apple lawsuit .** The reason I say this is that Qualcomm and Apple share a codependent love hate relationship and the lawsuit has basically become a [negotiation for future pricing.](https://9to5mac.com/2018/05/01/qualcomm-apple-resolution-offer/)

&#x200B;

QTL is a money printing juggernaut, **it doesnt matter whether or not you use QCOM chips on your wireless device**, you still have to pay the license fees. 

&#x200B;

QCOMs Snapdragon is the best Android processor out there (Apple makes their own.). QCOMs RF and WiFi chipsets are amongst the best in the industry. (Apple used Intel modems and there is a rumor that they might make their own in 2020.)

&#x200B;

QCOM is using this industry leadership to branch of and dominate niche markets like wearables and quick charge. Their IoT and automotive strategy took a bit of a hit with the failed acquisition of NXP, but they havent given up on those markets. 

&#x200B;

On the wireless landscape there are a bunch of new technologies that will be hitting the market next year and Qualcomm is an outright market leader in many of these.

&#x200B;

**WiFi -** 802.11 ax, only real competition is Broadcom (MRVL, Mediatek and Intel are stinking turds.)and they havent been able to figure out [key parts of the spec](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-battle-for-next-gen-wi-fi-pits-qualcomm-against-broadcom-2018-09-10). This tech is slated to start hitting enterprise end of this year and consumer markets by mid to late 2019 (phones).

&#x200B;

**5G:-** Rolling out soon, testbeds are being scaled up, mass adoption is projected in 2020. 

&#x200B;

TLDR:  Keep looking at QCOM leaps, end of Apple lawsuit is fundamentally good for QCOM, Trade War is the biggest storm cloud (sorry for using this). Watch for an immediate tank in the stock price from any trade or lawsuit news.  

Again this isnt a FD play strictly long term. 

I dont really know how to do TA voodoo but I think anything below 65 is a steal for QCOM. I would buy leaps if it hit between 65 - 68.

And yet, even though Tesla's PE ratio used to be 1400 in 2021, it's now at about 40. Makes you think huh? ü§î

Thus, I decided to test this explicitly. I wanted to see if PE ratio ACTUALLY mattered. I found that it matters A LOT... if you want to lose money üòÇ

# DD on PE

[I have a full writeup here](https://nexustrade.io/blog/you-will-never-look-at-a-stocks-pe-ratio-the-same-after-reading-this-20240319). First, I used an LLM to find 10 stocks with a PE ratio below 10 that had the highest market caps as of **January 1st 2023**. I got the following list:

* Company: Exxon Mobil Corporation (Symbol: XOM)
   * Description: Engages in the exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas globally.
   * P/E Ratio: 9.04616
   * Market Cap: $471,642,800,000
* Company: Pfizer Inc. (Symbol: PFE)
   * Description: Discovers, develops, and sells biopharmaceutical products worldwide.
   * P/E Ratio: 9.65214
   * Market Cap: $287,302,680,000
* Company: Toyota Motor Corporation (Symbol: TM)
   * Description: Designs, manufactures, and sells passenger vehicles and related parts globally.
   * P/E Ratio: 7.47751
   * Market Cap: $189,102,358,004
* Company: Verizon Communications Inc. (Symbol: VZ)
   * Description: Provides communications, technology, and entertainment products and services worldwide.
   * P/E Ratio: 8.5848
   * Market Cap: $165,519,400,000
* Company: ConocoPhillips (Symbol: COP)
   * Description: Explores for, produces, and markets crude oil, natural gas, and LNG globally.
   * P/E Ratio: 8.56037
   * Market Cap: $152,195,338,000
* Company: AT&T Inc. (Symbol: T)
   * Description: Provides telecommunications and technology services worldwide.
   * P/E Ratio: 6.76593
   * Market Cap: $140,781,270,000
* Company: QUALCOMM Incorporated (Symbol: QCOM)
   * Description: Develops  foundational technologies for the wireless industry globally.
   * P/E Ratio: 9.54411
   * Market Cap: $123,352,680,000
* Company: The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (Symbol: GS)
   * Description: Provides financial services for corporations, institutions, and individuals worldwide.
   * P/E Ratio: 9.02693
   * Market Cap: $121,899,900,000
* Company: Intel Corporation (Symbol: INTC)
   * Description: Designs, develops, and sells computing products and services globally.
   * P/E Ratio: 8.12612
   * Market Cap: $108,838,740,000
* Company: Citigroup Inc. (Symbol: C)
   * Description: Provides financial products and services globally.
   * P/E Ratio: 5.71683
   * Market Cap: $87,814,045,000

I then ran a backtest on these stocks from **Jan 1st, 2023 to March 19th, 2024**. I did ""Buy and Hold"" for each stock on this list. I then got the following results.

[Backtesting \\""Buy and Hold\\"" across these 10 stocks](https://preview.redd.it/qenikmgz28pc1.png?width=2054&format=png&auto=webp&s=c05cd8ee1b41370712194f63b262e56b0742bae7)

Most of the stocks in the portfolio like Toyota, Verizon, and AT&T were flat. Intel was a ""big"" winner and Pfizer was a huge loser. In the end, **this combination of stocks didn't even outperform SPY.**

https://preview.redd.it/78ql0h4b38pc1.png?width=754&format=png&auto=webp&s=9435697de6abfc6618cf5194b4c1757128081315

This is in contrast to something like Cash Flow, which has been shown to *slightly* outperform the S&P 500.

[Seeing how well 5 companies with the highest free cash flow increase from 2016 to 2020 performed. This stategy outperformed the market.](https://preview.redd.it/e6fokktp48pc1.png?width=2054&format=png&auto=webp&s=1232f6c7ec93a70aec2efbdbc18b9da620f2af23)

# What did we learn?

Know that next time, ANYTIME someone says ""the PE ratio is low"", they are officially a regard and a parrot that regurgitates NPC talking points. PE ratio means jack-diggedly squat, and literally can't outperform SPY. At the same time, other metrics (like the increase in free cash flow) actually matters when picking good stocks.

# Positions

* 1 HOOD $19C 3/22/24 (Sold to open)
* 1 MSFT $420C 3/21/25

Alright, here's a play even the most dim witted of you can follow. If any of you have been paying any attention to the GPU and graphics cards market you'd have realized one thing by now. You're shit out of luck if you want to buy a graphics card in the current market - they've been sold out for quite a while now and if you want to buy 1 then be ready to shell out $3k-$4k.. There's even a Japanese retailer selling these babies, the RTX 3090 Ti for a whopping $5500. That's right, let that sink in. These bad boys are selling for 3x the MSRP and NVIDIA is set to launch the GeForce RTX 3090 Ti, you guessed it, right before earnings.

Moreover, there had been a severe shortage of GPUs and graphics cards over the past year thanks to the Zuck buying a bunch from NVIDIA for his little VR porn project. Coupled with the fact that virgin gamers around the world are ravenous to get their hands on one of these bad boys when the new lot is out guarantees it will be sold out instantly. 

Don't believe me? Okay believe the smart money then: One of the world‚Äôs largest public pensions by assets made major changes in its investments in large-cap tech stocks as 2021 came to a close.

I would like to end this by saying this is the real world and although NVDA has beat expected earnings 5 years in a row, anything can happen and I do not want to be responsible for any of you having to drink your piss to survive, but if there was a play to bet the house on, this would be it.

Bois, I've spent my morning on big brain thinking and drew a strategy with crayons on my wall. The market believes in GenAI and from my miniscule tendie focused vantage point I don't have any reason to disagree.

https://preview.redd.it/dfs7xvyeecjc1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc1620f4836cb6a92afae62b51d838c4057f5973

A few very basic observations:

* Who has the necessary IP to build chips needed for training and serving LLMs? Nvidia, Google, Apple
* Who can produce the required chips at scale? TSMC
* Who builds the machines to produce these chips? ASML
* If LLM inference was further optimized to not require state of the art accelerator chips, who else could supply? Intel, Samsung, GlobalFoundries

**Time for some hedge fund level deep market analysis:**

What stands out:

* We have multiple companies competing at the IP level and the Nvidia train already left the station - next stop bagholding town
* We only have one dominant producer (TSMC) and enabler (ASML)
* Alternative enablers and producers are not discounted

With competition at the IP level, the real gatekeepers are the producer (short term) and enabler (mid term). They can dictate prices, especially given the expectation pressure and demand the key IP companies have.

**TSMC is offered at a massive discount compared to the rest of the market.**

Now you will say that's because of Geopolitical risk.

Right. But what if China actually attacks Taiwan? What if TSMC must stop production?

All of the IP companies will be royally skrewed. The US momentum on AI will be severely slowed down.

So 1) every single IP company above is exposed to the same risk re/ AI - especially Nvidia, and 2) the USA is highly invested in protecting Taiwan's production capabilities.

China has economical issues. They are again trying to increase trade with the USA. They are even trying to take a peacemaker role (see MSC). Going for Taiwan would be too expensive, maybe even detrimental to their economy. IMHO the likelihood is now at a new low.

**That leaves TSMC priced at a \~50% discount.**

Fellow wendy workers, we have an opportunity to go beyond YOLO-ing again. Who's in?

To put this into perspective there are 3 players in the 5g scene: Ericsson ($ERIC), Huawei (Private chinese company), and Nokia ($NOK). The US government isnt really allowing Huawei into the 5g scene on US soil so that really only leaves two companies... not three. That being said i believe Nokia is undervalued and im confused as to why it's at where it is... just an opinion but I think market cap should be atleast double of what it is now."

I have a large position in QCOM ($100k) at around $55/share.  I am obviously bullish on its future, but appreciate that there are several ways the shares could see a significant discount in the next 1-2 years. Because of that, I am considering two options plays:

1. Keep current shares and buy LEAP calls at @ 55 expiring Jan 2019 to add to my position if the share price breaks higher (I won't have more cash before late 2018 so this lets me get more shares and is consistent with my bullish views). 

2. Close my position and use the cash to sell 24-25 LEAP puts @ 40 pitcher expiring Jan 2019 and then buy leap calls @ 55 expiring Jan 2019. I would need to tap some reserves to buy the calls and obviously risk having the calls expire worthless. But if shares fall I would be a buyer at $40 and don't want to lose the upside because I am bullish. 

When you guys are done sunning yourselfs on the yacht this morning, please let me know how you would play QCOM here."
Arm Stocks Jumps Than 50% on AI Craze,182,1alynq0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1alynq0/arm_stocks_jumps_than_50_on_ai_craze/,83,2024-02-08 21:16:11,"""Shares of British chip designer Arm surged more than 50% after its earnings report surprised analysts and suggested artificial intelligence may be driving a recovery in the semiconductor industry.

The company said it made a record $824 million of sales in its last quarter, and projected as much as $900 million for the current quarter.

Both figures topped Wall Street expectations, reflecting a recovery in demand for parts of the chip industry fueled in large part by big investments in artificial intelligence computing.

Arm shares rose to about $115 Thursday, sending its market value to over $117 billion and more than doubling its price at its [initial public offering](https://www.wsj.com/finance/stocks/arm-set-to-price-ipo-at-52-a-share-214e3351) last year.

Arm‚Äôs chip designs are in nearly all the world‚Äôs smartphones, making its results an indicator of the health of the handset market.

A faster-than-expected shift to AI gave a boost to the results, Arm executives said. Many of the latest Arm-based smartphone chips have AI capabilities built in, and Arm-based circuits are part of some of the most advanced AI systems made by Nvidia, the leader in AI computing.

‚ÄúGiven we are in the very early innings of AI adoption, we expect Arm‚Äôs sales to remain robust‚Äù in the coming years, analysts at Citi said in a note.

Arm‚Äôs earnings surprise and market surge come at a time of mixed fortunes for the broader chip industry.

**Qualcomm**, a major designer of mobile-phone chips, [reported better-than-expected results last month](https://www.wsj.com/business/earnings/qualcomm-1q-revenue-tops-estimates-on-growth-in-handsets-automotive-31f098c4). Nvidia [has reported several quarters of blockbuster results as AI investments skyrocket](https://www.wsj.com/articles/nvidia-joins-1-trillion-club-fueled-by-ais-rise-f515dd6e), sending its shares to new highs and making it one of the world‚Äôs most valuable companies.

**Intel** has had healthier sales in recent months as the personal-computer market recovers, although [the company last month gave a muted outlook due to weakness in its programmable-chip and self-driving units](https://www.wsj.com/business/earnings/intel-intc-q4-earnings-report-2023-8b61b812).""

The backup company in the US is The Quartz Company, which is also located in Spruce Pine, and is probably also gone too.

I am trying to figure out who would be screwed the most from this. I'm sure it's a gamble, but some of the big semiconductor companies are going to be railed with no more supply of their fine powder. Thoughts on who to short?
I'm thinking NVDA, TSM, AVGO, AMD, TXN, QCOM.
Any other ideas?

I'm looking at google maps and crossing with this image from twitter

That location is about 767m above sea level. Coordinates: 35¬∞54'58""N 82¬∞04'13""W. Flood looks like a meter or two. So lets say that everything below 768m flooded at some point in the last few days.

Sibelco has their mine at 35¬∞53'52""N 82¬∞03'40""W, which is like 800m above sea level, so that's probably fine minus road damage from falling trees.

Quartz Co has an operation on the river 35¬∞55'37""N 82¬∞05'36""W with a ton of equipment (presumably railroad shipping) that sits below 765m. Safe to say that area has been underwater. But their scale is smaller than Sibelco, so I don't think it would matter much"

"GSAT DD (It's the spectrum, stupid)",383,lrdg2q,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lrdg2q/gsat_dd_its_the_spectrum_stupid/,140,2021-02-24 19:25:56,"
This is all off the top of my head but it‚Äôs a basic outline of why I think GSAT is a big deal. There are a lot of people who understand the company better than I do, but I really think this is worth looking seriously at, and its up a little bit today so here‚Äôs my first stab at DD.

Be advised: I‚Äôm not a sat com expert, nor is this investment advice and I really have no Idea what I'm doing here.

Also, I should say Price Targets for GSAT range wildly, I've seen targets over $200 per share floated around with some pretty impressive analysis behind it, but more conservatively I'm in line with suggestions it COULD be $30-$50 if and when all goes well in a very optimal scenario, and it seems there's a much broader consensus on a 7$ to 10$ target in the near term. 

GSAT owns c band and s band spectrum, which with the push to 5G and Internet of Things has suddenly become incredibly valuable. Recent FCC auctions will attest to this.

For years, GSAT was waiting for FCC authorization on that spectrum, but by the time they got it, they had issues with debt and investors were wary to jump in without a clear Monetization plan for their spectrum. The heavy debt situation has since been resolved, giving them enough of a cash runway to continue in for the next three years. Their business model during most of the past decade involved satellite phones and gps tracking, which, with their aging satellites and limited market for that kind of stuff, was never meant to do much more than keep the lights on while they waited for the value of their spectrum to appreciate. Their share price languished under $1 for a long time until 2021, when a couple things started to shift. They partnered with Nokia to set up a secure redundant 5G node for the port of Seattle, with more similar collaborations likely down the line. Then, most recently, QCOM announced that their x65 next generation snapdragon modem, which is the most popular smartphone modem in the world, will connect to the n53 band specifically. GSAT owns this band of spectrum, nobody else. QCOM obviously did that for a reason, but as of now, there‚Äôs no widespread usage of that spectrum as it‚Äôs not really being used except by GSAT SPOT devices and phones, which is to say, hardly at all.

Exactly what that means for GSAT is unclear, but what it does mean is that within a few years, millions of devices around the world will have the ability to connect to their spectrum.

There‚Äôs a lot of DD out there breaking down price targets, but the truth is nobody knows, and the CEO and other execs have shown an incredible amount of patience and personal investment in terms of allowing their spectrum assets to appreciate while putting their own money on the line to keep things afloat over the years. 

Starlink, AT&T, Verizon should all be interested in buying, and have probably all made offers or overtures, but GSAT has not bitten, even when they needed the money. Which also suggests that the company is not interested in a sale. And indeed, leasing the spectrum might be far more lucrative than an outright sale, and better for shareholders. 

I won't bother describing the different possible monetization strategies here, as I've linked to a report published by Nokia at the bottom of this post that does a much better job than I could. 

GSATs spectrum is sometimes compared to a large swath of undeveloped beachfront property in the middle of South Beach, completely clean and unsullied in the middle of an increasingly crowded and frenzied space.

They look like a penny stock at first glance but they are far from it, and it may be the ultimate 5G play.

You might ask: What about Musk‚Äôs Starlink? Aren‚Äôt they going to eat GSAT‚Äôs lunch?

EDIT: This is better addressed in a comment by u/squishjonesjr:

""Starlink use Ku band for their user terminal links and Ka for the gateway links, they wont need any spectrum in C-band. Also doubt they would purchase spectrum to ensure others cant use it, their main focus is not going bankrupt. Their initial constellation will cost ~$10B and could be much higher if more sats are needed (filed for up to 15k sats). Not to mention their gen 1 sats have a useful life of 5 years so they will have to replace those soon after service start."" 

-u/squishjonesjr


Starlink probably doesn‚Äôt need GSAT spectrum, and for our purposes, GSAT is not really in competition with Starlink, as their current business model (which will be affected by Starlink) is not the source of the stocks theoretcal valuation. but if someone DID want to compete with Starlink, they would need to access GSAT assets. Which is another reason why Starlink might need to get there first, not because they need it but because they dont want anyone else to have it.

Starlink is a possible buyer for GSAT, not for their satellites but for their spectrum. The value of GSAT is NOT in its satellites or the ground units, its in the spectrum.

DISH is another possible buyer for GSAT.

Some people point to debt issues with GSAT . It‚Äôs true the company has diluted its shares quite a bit to remain solvent over the years, but they currently have enough cash on hand to give them a three year runway. It would make ZERO sense for another offering to occur BEFORE a major monetization event for the spectrum, and since this is 5G, that monetization event is going to happen WELL before they run out of cash.

Another issue often raised: ‚ÄúThe FCC can just seize spectrum and reallocate it if they want, that‚Äôs what happened to (insert late 90‚Äôs early 2000‚Äôs Sat company here)

These other companies, from what I understand, had major issues with solvency, and so they basically went to the FCC to see what kind of deal they could get if they surrendered it to be reallocated. BTW, I‚Äôve learned that the correct way to talk about spectrum is not as something that GSAT owns or holds but as something they currently control.

Seems Risky?

Betting on the value of Globalstar spectrum WAS a risky play, but now that QCOM has legitimized the value of the n53 band (albeit not explicitly or specifically in terms of eventual use case) by including it in the next gen snapdragon's connectivity ability, the risk associated with the play has diminished a great deal.

The bear case of the QCOM aspect of all this is that including n53 connectivity is more of a marketing trick than something they imagine will actually get used, but given that n53 is extraordinarily underutilized at this point, even that scenario implies that QCOM expects to see expanded usage of that band in the short term.

Also I thought it was interesting that Nokia would publish this on their website: [https://www.nokia.com/blog/case-globalstar-6-ways-leverage-spectrum-asset/](https://www.nokia.com/blog/case-globalstar-6-ways-leverage-spectrum-asset/)

From Nokia:

‚ÄúNokia customer Globalstar Inc., a U.S. based provider of mobile satellite voice and data services, is in the enviable position of having 2.4 GHz spectrum that works everywhere, meaning it has been globally allocated. 2.4 GHz spectrum is in the sweet spot from a physics perspective because it‚Äôs good for both coverage and capacity. Although it‚Äôs not yet a 3GPP standardized spectrum band, it has been approved by the Federal Communications Commission and recently in other countries. It‚Äôs remarkably clean meaning it‚Äôs clear, has no co-channel interference and provides network benefits for both indoor and outdoor deployments.

Globalstar turned to Nokia to help determine the band characteristics for its available spectrum and identify potential application options. Nokia‚Äôs Network Planning and Optimization (NPO) team conducted a small cell network study of Globalstar‚Äôs 2.4 GHz spectrum as compared to a similar HetNet network in 2.1 GHz. The study proved the versatility of Globalstar‚Äôs spectrum, showing that operators with a small cell network could benefit from Globalstar‚Äôs clean spectrum, while those without small cell networks could benefit from its huge capacity.

In our study, Globalstar‚Äôs spectrum outperformed outdoor small cell deployments by 20%, while requiring 33% less infrastructure. For indoors in an urban office environment, we were able to deploy approximately half the access points required since the band has no interference from macro towers operating in the same frequency. The full report can be seen here. The team went a step further to also provide six business model options for Globalstar to consider.

‚ÄúWe were excited to work with Nokia‚Äôs NPO experts to help determine how to best monetize and maximize the use cases of our spectrum asset so we can deliver the highest quality experience to the end users,‚Äù said Jay Monroe, chairman and CEO of Globalstar.

6 ways to monetize & maximize the spectrum

1.Lease the spectrum to incumbent operators ‚Äì This provides extra capacity for operators and uses their own RAN equipment and services. Operators can use clean spectrum without incumbrance and it supports standard capabilities like Carrier Aggregation, roaming and redirection. For Globalstar, this is a simple revenue model without any operational burdens.

2.Dedicated in-building small cell spectrum ‚Äì The analysis clearly shows the difficulties presented by macro interference to small cell deployments. Offering a dedicated, clean spectrum band would dramatically improve the performance of these HetNets and significantly reduce the cost to deploy them. Globalstar could lease the spectrum to one carrier nationwide or carriers in geographic regions that wanted to reduce the strain on their expensive macro tower infrastructure.

3.Use the spectrum as a satellite service enhancement ‚Äì By deploying RANs in Globalstar‚Äôs high use areas, such as air terminals, shipping ports, military bases or cargo handling facilities, Globalstar can both provide satellite offload and support high data rates and advanced applications. Enhanced services are provided to customers where they normally congregate, and for these customers there is a layer of satellite redundancy in the event of disruptions in terrestrial networks.

4.Lease spectrum for private LTE systems to non-carriers ‚Äì Cable companies are increasingly interested in pursuing wireless services themselves. Globalstar‚Äôs spectrum provides an opportunity to add a private LTE network on top of their dense cable plant. Alternatively, as the in-building networks are further developed there may be an opportunity to include Globalstar‚Äôs band as a private LTE service on top of neutral host models.

5.Directly provide private services to enterprises ‚Äì By offering private LTE systems directly to enterprises, Globalstar provides spectrum, equipment and services to end user customers, which provides direct control over the user experience and maximizes private LTE system revenue opportunities.

"AMKR - Amkor Technology - A Great Play in the Semi Conductor Space - CRIMINALLY Undervalued, literally can't go tits up!",181,lhv717,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhv717/amkr_amkor_technology_a_great_play_in_the_semi/,180,2021-02-12 02:54:55,"EDIT: So we are are almost up over 10% since I wrote this DD. Steady 3-4% both days. That is what we need, slowly ride this baby to to the moon

Been a member for about a year and seen some great DD, so about time I do one of my own. It might be a bit long, so a summary upfront:

**AMKR ‚Äì Amkor Technology** \- is an undervalued stock in the semi-conductor space, which is going to be a super-hot sector in 2021 and beyond. The stock has great financials and the P/E ratio is killer, even better than any of your established boomer stocks.  The company has a market cap of 5B on revenues of $5B

This is not a get rich quick scheme or a pump and dump. Invest wisely and this one should rise gradually during the year.

Position ‚Äì 16c , 3/19 and 24c 3/19 and 2k shares. I got into the stocks couple of weeks back when it was at $16

Now that is out of the way, lets get to it.

**What do you look for in a great DD:**

1. Company is in a growing space that is hot at the moment
2. Financials are solid
3. Outlook is great
4. Company is a bit of an unknown and undervalued
5. There is an upcoming catalyst

Before I get into each, let me simply tell you what AMKR does. The company provides testing and packaging services to semi-conductor companies. So it works with companies that need to develop chips for your 5G phones, for your future EV Lambos. Basically it provides critical services to companies that manufacture or deal in semi conductors. The company is based in the USA and has big players like Qualcomm, Sony, AMD etc as its customers.

So now lets get to it:

&#x200B;

1. ***Company is in a growing space that is hot at the moment.***

Unless you have been hiding under the rock, semi-conductors are hot at the moment. There are multiple catalysts, from 5G phones roll out, to the EV wave, to more cloud computing, everything needs processing power. This means more demand for semi-conductors, in fact there is already a significant shortage being seen across the board. This is a hot sector to be in the moment. Don‚Äôt believe me here you go:

[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/10/whats-causing-the-chip-shortage-affecting-ps5-cars-and-more.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/10/whats-causing-the-chip-shortage-affecting-ps5-cars-and-more.html)

[https://www.ft.com/content/6caf7028-cae1-44f3-9bc2-7dc2d47a23ef](https://www.ft.com/content/6caf7028-cae1-44f3-9bc2-7dc2d47a23ef)

Everything in this sector is running at full capacity. More production means more testing and packaging and this shit is not going to slow down anytime soon.

&#x200B;

***2.*** ***Financials are solid***

I can more with you all the details in the world, on how the company is constantly reducing it‚Äôs debt and increasing operating income or how it recently announced it is going to start giving dividends, but I am going to focus on one metric. P/E ratio.

While I was typing up this DD the P/E ratio of this company is 15.91. So is that good or bad, well to put it in context, Apple is 36.57 and Microsoft is is 36.35. Even your boomer stock PepsiCo is at 26.7.

Okay, but what about other companies in this space. TSM the biggest player in this space is at 62.17. Another favourite of this reddit, UMC 78.63, QCOM 24.81. AMAT, probably the closest to their business 28.79

Like I said, that metric alone tell you how criminally undervalued this company is.  Even a P/E ratio of 25, which would put it in the low end of the range, would shoot its price past $30

&#x200B;

***3. Outlook is great:***

Well, I am not going to say much, but just copy paste the closing statement from the last earnings call:

‚ÄúOkay. Well, thank you very much. Before closing the call, I would like to recap a few key messages. 2020 was a remarkable year for Amkor. We generated over $5 billion in revenue and $1.40 per share, and initiate cash dividend program for our stockholders. We accomplished this while navigating through a challenging global pandemic. We are expecting the first quarter of 2021 to be another solid quarter with revenue of $1.32 billion at the mid-point of our guidance.

2021 is expected to be another growth year for Amkor. Semiconductor market forecasts predict growth of around 9% for the year. With Amkor‚Äôs position in key growth markets, we expect to outgrow the semi-market forecast in 2021‚Äù

UMC has a revenue of $5bn and a valuation of $25B which is 4X of this company!AMAT as 3.5 times the revenue and 20X the valuation

Also to recap their 2020 highlights

Full Year 2020 Highlights:

Net sales $5.05 billion, up 24.6% year on yearNet income $338 million, earnings per diluted share $1.40EBITDA $960 millionNet cash from operations $770 million and free cash flow $221 million

Sixth consecutive year of positive free cash flow

Financial information on the company:

[https://ir.amkor.com/static-files/4052c2a2-2944-4563-88b2-6a6c928ae302](https://ir.amkor.com/static-files/4052c2a2-2944-4563-88b2-6a6c928ae302)

&#x200B;

***4. Company is bit of an unknown and undervalued***

I mean, come on, everyone talks about TSM, AMAT, UMC, but has anyone every mentioned this company? It is literally the definition of an unknown.

Undervalued, it is CRIMINALLY undervalued compared to it peers. Look at the P/E ratio, literally better than anyone else. Its revenue to valuation ratio, literally better than anyone else. I mean I don‚Äôt know what else to say. This speaks BUY BUY BUY!

I mean, this company should have a valuation of at least $10B, which would shoot its price past $40

&#x200B;

*5.* ***There is upcoming catalyst***

Well company just become a strong buy on Zacks, but there is a bigger catalyst coming up on Feb 16th, which is the reason for some price action today:

[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amkor-technology-set-join-p-232600920.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amkor-technology-set-join-p-232600920.html)

**The company is going to join the S&P Mid Cap 400 on Feb 16th.** This is probably the reason why the stock moved so much today.

This alone will bring more capital into the company. More and more people will look into this company and realize the absurd valuation compared to its peers and yes this rill rise more. Today was just the start of what might happen over the next week

&#x200B;

**TLDR:**

Yes I know the stock has doubled in the last 6 months and jumped 20% today, but

1. The outlook is better than ever in company‚Äôs history
2. They delivered their best ever quarter and will even pay dividends
3. The financial ratios are best in class, even better than all your boomer stocks
4. Based on the revenue and ratios alone the company should be valued at least 2X what it is today
5. Company is in the super hot semi-conductor space
6. There is an upcoming catalyst on Feb 16th - S&P 400 Mid-Cap inclusion
7. Another stock being mentioned here ON has the same revenue and income and is valued 3X more. if you think that is  a great play, which it is, think about this one!
8. The volume is lowish, but again I see that as a positive as this will climb quickly once there is interest. The avg volume on this stock is 1M, it was 5M today and already 700k after hours

I am balls deep on 24c, 3/19, which was looking risky two days ago, but it looks juicy as fuck now.

As always do your DD, and enjoy the tendies!

# [Why a Qualcomm takeover of Intel is hard to make work](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/why-qualcomm-takeover-intel-hard-141757123.html)

Intel stock climbs as Apollo Global Management ([APO](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/APO?.tsrc=fin-srch)), the parent company of Yahoo Finance,¬†[reportedly](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-22/apollo-is-said-to-offer-multibillion-dollar-investment-in-intel)¬†offered a multibillion-dollar investment. That came after¬†[reports¬†](https://www.wsj.com/business/deals/qualcomm-approached-intel-about-a-takeover-in-recent-days-fa114f9d)that Qualcomm ([QCOM](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/QCOM)) approached Intel with a buyout offer. Stacy Rasgon, Bernstein managing director and senior analyst, joins Morning Brief hosts¬†[Brad Smith](https://www.yahoo.com/author/bradley-smith/)¬†and¬†[Seana Smith](https://www.yahoo.com/author/seana-smith/)¬†to discuss the legacy chipmaker‚Äôs position amid reported takeover and investment opportunities.

Rasgon tells Yahoo Finance he has ‚Äúa hard time seeing that deal work, especially if the fabs are included, and the issue is that they're losing a lot of money right now.‚Äù A fab is a semiconductor fabrication facility, a factory that makes chips.

‚ÄúQualcomm would probably have to use a lot of stock. If they did a stock deal, it's significantly dilutive for Qualcomm. It could be 20% or even more dilutive, and the problem is if they start borrowing money and adding cash, the leverage goes up really, really high, really, really quickly.‚Äù

https://preview.redd.it/uy2gr7kiemrd1.png?width=1391&format=png&auto=webp&s=95b6776ee2bd49ddedc6b223c6fe2c2555530b72

The analyst says, ‚ÄúI have a really hard time seeing it work with the fabs. I'm not sure that they could do a deal without the fabs,‚Äù as, in his view, they couldn‚Äôt spin off their fab businesses into independent companies, but they can‚Äôt scrap them. ‚ÄúI don't think that that's politically viable at this point,‚Äù as the US prioritizes its position in the global chip market.

He adds, ‚ÄúI'd rather not see Qualcomm do a deal like this. I think it's hard to do a deal where I think the risk would justify the returns on this. We'll see if they can construct something. But I don't really like it. So I'm hoping we don't have something like this.‚Äù

Regarding the potential Apollo investment, Rasgon highlights that Apollo has an¬†[existing relationship](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-apollo-agree-joint-venture-200500820.html)¬†with Intel. The analyst says that while neither party has confirmed the reports that Apollo could invest up to $5 billion in Intel, the story could be viewed as ‚Äúa vote of confidence‚Äù in the company.

Rasgon says the regulatory side of a potential Qualcomm takeover is ‚Äúreally tough,‚Äù though he notes in the US it ‚Äúcould be easier‚Äù as its ‚Äúa US national champion buying a national champion.‚Äù

He says, ‚ÄúThere are very few areas where Qualcomm and Intel really overlap,‚Äù with the auto space being one. He explains that Intel and Qualcomm have likely discussed Intel divesting from Mobileye ([MBLY](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MBLY)) if there is a takeover.

"SMCI: Attractive Valuation, Great Potential",12,1e7hquw,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1e7hquw/smci_attractive_valuation_great_potential/,24,2024-07-20 05:02:11,"**POST-EARNINGS UPDATE:**

SMCI just delivered very disappointing Q4 results as gross margin (11.2% v 15.5%) and EPS (6.25 v 8.1) fell short of the lower bound of their previous update. The problem with FCF has also become severe.

Although their revenue guidance is still optimistic, **I no longer buy their EPS prediction**. Therefore, I need to acknowledge that my prior understanding of this company is wrong.

**I now downgrade my rating of this stock, from overweight to underweight. The price target is adjusted from 1050 to 600.**

**The earnings, on the other side, confirm that NVDA has a very strong quarter.**

**Original Post:**

AI frenzy is unfinished, yet the broader market suffered from a significant retreat this week. The PHLX Semiconductor Index dipped 6.86% on Wednesday, the worst performance since the pandemic. NVDA barely holds the 118 level, while other stocks such as MU, QCOM, AMAT, LRCX, ASML, etc., have dipped below key price levels. They are seeking support on MA120 (or at an even lower price).

I am paying attention to **SMCI**, a stock that may be less focused these days. SMCI lost more than 12% this week and closed at a price below 800. However, this dip has offered unique opportunities, reducing its post-earning risks, and making the price very attractive. Here is my analysis.

0. My Position:

**18 SMCI 01/17/2025 1200 C, 6 bought this Wednesday and Thursday at an average price of 71.6. My average cost is now 110. Although I have suffered a loss of 35%, I am sure that this is just temporary.**

1. Valuation:

**SMCI is trading at a PE TTM of 44.63 and a 1-yr forward PE of 22.17**. This is a very attractive price given its growth this year and the year to come. As a comparison, DELL is trading at a 1-yr forward PE of 16.17, with its growth much slower than that of SMCI.

SMCI is offering the market its unique stack-scale liquid-cooling system that can customized. With the surging demand for liquid cooling for AI server applications (especially the application of the NVDA B series), I expect SMCI to expand its portion in the AI server market while maintaining its current gross margin. The fundamentals of the corp are solid and I see great visibility in its future performance.

2. Technical:

SMCI is trading at a support level of 760-805 which is ultrastrong, which marks the dividing line between the bullish and bearish momentum. We can see that this level has been tested multiple times in the past 2 months, while strong buying has supported the stock in this range. All MAs (up to MA120) have converged, indicating the bottom consolidation to come to an end.

Besides, **the current price is only 7% higher than the closing price of the previous earnings call, while its peers in the semiconductor industry have surged by more than 20% (e.g., 25% for NVDA).** This indicates that the market may have digested the possible scenario of the stock failing to deliver results that are good enough. This risk-off emotion will help relieve some post-earning risks.

3. The broader semiconductor industry:

ASML delivered very good Q2 results, with a <2% miss on its revenue guidance for Q3. TSM just delivered a blockbusting earnings report that beat the top and bottom lines on both quarterly performance and guidance. This indicates that chipmakers such as NVDA are having a very good season with demands surging even more than before. **This indicates that SMCI is also having a very great season where I expect its revenue and EPS to beat its bar which has far exceeded the market consensus**.

4. Rating:

**I now initiate an 'Outperform' rating for SMCI. The 12-month price target is set to be 1050, which indicates a potential upside of about 35%.**

The expected forward valuation is about 30, somewhat larger than its peers simply because of its growth."

Disclaimer: *I am only posting this yearly update as a way for me to journal my thinking and for future bragging rights (or to become an eternal WSB* ü§°). I am documenting my way to an 8 digit portfolio by the end of the decade.

Fellow degens,

Here is my **yearly 4/20 update** on holding $ASTS ([AST SpaceMobile](https://ast-science.com/)). Safe to say, if you had bought last year at $8 \[[4/20 Update 2022](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/u7s7lm/the_gamechanger_in_mobile_broadband_connectivity/) \-- I invite you to read it for some context\] and held until now, you would be down >45%. Ouch. You would have underperformed (euphemism) both SPY and QQQ by a wide margin over the past 12 months... Ouch (twice). At least, I did. Ouch (again).

However, you would have had plenty of opportunities to sell along the way at $9 in June, $14 in August and $9 in November. And this would have put you well ahead of the indices last year in a down market. It has also outperformed it's peers (deSPACs are down c.60% over the same period and space-related deSPACs have mostly become pennystocks -- a few exceptions exist).

Although, I have been proven wrong so far (return-wise) and feel I jumped the gun too early. I continue to believe this is a company to follow closely. Here is why.

# Recap of last year, where I was wrong and where I wasn't

Last year, I had identified four categories of risks: launch, technology, funding and regulatory.

**I was wrong**. The launch didn't happen in June 2022 but was delayed to September 2022 (not the first time there is a delay with the company). However, **I was right** in guessing that the company had really well engineered it's deployment system and everything went out smoothly.

**I was right**. The technology to connect the satellite directly to an unmodified phone works ([CEO tweet](https://twitter.com/AbelAvellan/status/1647643784291704832)). I am expecting a formal event in the coming months to announce it with AST's partners (AT&T, Vodafone, Rakuten, etc.).

**I was right**. There seems to be a huge market for the service. Mind you. Last year, nobody was talking about D2D (direct-to-device) -- it was deemed impossible by industry professionals (just like landing a rocket was deemed impossible). Now, Apple/GSAT, Starlink/TMUS, IRDM/QCOM are all working on the opportunity. Do you think a trillion dollar company and multi-billion ones would do that if there was no demand?

That's a paradigm shift I didn't expect. Also, I believe AST to be a few years ahead at the very least (after the recently announced delay by Starlink and Samsung not adopting QCOM's solution).

It also seems like the FCC is doing a full 180 on regulations to accomodate for this new market. Something to watch closely.

**I was wrong**. I didn't see how shit the market would become and how difficult it would be to raise money in last year's environment. I am certain the constellation will get funded, too many stakeholders want to see it happen. Yes. **I was right**. Last year, AST had 17 partners under agreement and now they have **35 agreements covering more than 2bn people**.

# Is the risk/reward still as good?

At today's price, I still believe it could be a multideca-bagger and why not dream a little for a 100-bagger (it's valued at <1% of Starlink, yes Starlink, not accounting for SpaceX) by the end of the decade.

On the risk-side, we now know the technology works, they are able to deploy the satellite and close the connection. Remember. **This was something even industry professionals thought was impossible**.

Moreover, there has been no insider sales (not even the SPAC sponsor -- find me another company where that is the case). The last insider buys were at $5.5 and I am sure it's nice to buy below them (offers some comfort on the downside).

The technicals seem to indicate that we have double-bottomed.

# What's next?

There is a regulatory ruling by the FCC tomorrow (4/20).

As mentioned earlier, I expect an event of some sort with AST's MNO partners (AT&T, Vodafone, etc.).

I expect hard contracts and funding arrangements to follow or be announced at such an event.

A successful test launch of Starship (highly unlikely) is a small bonus as it will signficantly lower cost of launch.

I still think this is not for everyone. I believe that I shall be fine hodling long term. I know that for most of you long term is 5 hours and the only fundamental research you do is based on price action over the past week.

Risk of this going to 0 is still significant and it has been a dud so far.

# Position

I bought 2,000 more shares since last year. 42,000 shares ([proof\_1](https://ibb.co/XDWkSBL) \+ [proof\_2](https://ibb.co/RHH1Px7))

TL;DR: Well, I am one year older and still full of cum. The reward is identical to last year but now with less risk as the technology has been proven. Still a **potential** 100 bagger by the end of the decade -- only company I know who can immediately tap 2bn customer once service becomes live.

See you next year.

This probability is higher than the 25% at the beginning of July, mainly due to various data indicating that the demand for labor is weakening more severely than expected, with initial signs of layoffs already appearing!

JP Morgan's Jamie Dimon also stated that a U.S. recession is the most likely scenario, with the chance of a soft landing being between 35% and 40%! Multiple economists have expressed their views, casting doubt over the economic rebound and causing U.S. stocks to open high but close low last night.

üëâ The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell over 230 points, and the S&P 500 index dropped by about 0.8%! The cumulative losses for both in the first five trading days of August mark the worst start since January 2016!

Let‚Äôs discuss the elephant in the room - 5G,256,akj164,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/akj164/lets_discuss_the_elephant_in_the_room_5g/,161,2019-01-28 08:20:28,"After painstaking research tonight I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that 5G will be the next millionaire maker among us. And that the entire US-China trade war is all about which country gets to dominate the 5G space in the next few years. The arrest, the IP theft, entire dispute is all about who will dominate 5G. And rightly so, as it will be a game changer. 

My approach to playing 5G is this... 

Right now buy AMERICAN cell tower companies. AMT, CCI, SBAC. These companies are holding gold in the form of cell towers. They‚Äôve barely flinched in the December massacre. Some at all time highs already, and looking like a new uptrend is starting. 

Stay away from telecom service providers like Verizon, AT&amp;amp;T etc because they will be the ones paying cell tower companies up their ass to use the towers. They are already investing heavily and will drain their pockets initially. They‚Äôre profits will gain years down the line as every noob wants the new ‚Äú5G‚Äù phone and the system becomes main stream. 

Stay the absolute fuck away from cable companies like CMCSA. 5G will enable faster wireless internet into your home without the use of cables. 

Possibly go long on 5G gadget suppliers and fiber companies. NOK, ERIC, GLW, ZAYO. They will be relied on heavily to get the infrastructure up. 

I will not be investing in Apple, Intel, AMD, QCOM etc YET. These companies are still a year or maybe more from seeing profits from 5G.

Also, YOLO everything on Apple when they do release their 5G Iphone. Not many people will pay for $1000+ Iphone because it doesn‚Äôt have a home screen button, but huge amounts of their loyal customers will pay even more to switch to the new 5G Iphone. 

I‚Äôm betting my nut sack the US will not concede 5G to China, and they‚Äôll put tremendous pressure on their allies AKA client states to tow the line and not proceed with allowing China to develop their nations telecommunications networks. 

In the event of a down turn in the US markets for 2018, I will continue to buy the cell tower companies and accumulate their shares. Although tech will get raped as we have seen in a down turn, these companies will remain relatively strong and give me more of a chance to accumulate. Plus they pay good dividends. 

tldr: Buy American cell tower companies for 5G rollout. Consider 5G equipment suppliers as well. Stay away from normie tech stocks in case of headwinds in US market. Short cable companies to the earths core.

EDIT: upon more reading, I am leaning towards NOK for hardware, GLW and ZAYO for fiber, CCI for small antennae, fiber, and already existing 4G infrastructure which will be used in some way to incorporate 5G (Idgaf what you retards say the cell towers will 100% be incorporated into 5G rollout). Cell tower co‚Äôs know this and are giving great forward guidance because of this. Also possibly DY for construction and engineering of the infrastructure. And maybe SWKS and QCOM for parents. 

Also the cable companies might consolidate, and they own a shit load of fiber networks which will be valuable for service providers. They are good targets for mergers and acquisitions HOWEVER if they decide they want to use 5G for their services it will cost them immensely to change their systems to stay relevant. So risky plays there. 

Also hoping this weeks earnings show some weakness in the market and we get a bit of bear action going. 

I want to invest in this 5G portfolio early to mid 2019 hopefully after a strong pullback in the market. 

If no strong pullback I will jump in and hedge with SPY puts 20% OTM with 0.5% of my portfolio as insurance recurring every month, buying puts 2 months till expiration. Need insurance in case we dive this year and I end up investing near the upper range of my 5G portfolio. 

If market tanks I sincerely think the 5G infrastructure roll out will be the next catalyst for the next bull market. I will go balls deep on 5G stocks if market tanks.

AMD and Intel DD,138,liyay9,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/liyay9/amd_and_intel_dd/,139,2021-02-13 16:11:14,"With the pandemic still going on and everyone needing more computers than ever and the ongoing trade war with China, there is a severe Chip shortage.

On Thursday, the CEOs of the major Chip producers (Intel, AMD, QCOM) have sent a letter to Biden that he should sent out an executive order to adress this shortage. ([https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-11/biden-team-pledges-aggressive-steps-to-address-chip-shortage](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-11/biden-team-pledges-aggressive-steps-to-address-chip-shortage))

I see three different scenarios:

1. Biden gives an executive order to build improve and increase the domestic chip foundries. This would be most bullish for Intel, since they are the only company with foundries in the USA. This would also help AMD and QCOM, since they would most likely that access to cheaper chips.
2. Biden lifts the trade restrictions set on semiconductors. This would mean that AMD and QCOM would get access to cheaper chips, but it would not solve the shortage of silicon so it is unlikely to happen. This would be bullish for AMD and Qualcomm, but it would not change the situation for Intel.
3. Biden does not do anything and the shortage will continue. If Biden does this nothing will be changed, it will be neither good or bad from Intel and AMD. AMD will still keep growing at a massive rate and Intel will still be a cash cow.

So regardless of what happens, I am very bullish on the semiconductor industry. I expect Biden to start ramping up semiconductor manufacturing the USA, because of his tough stance on China. At the moment almost all of the semiconductor industry is relying on Taiwan, and with the Chinese involvement in that country, it is very likely that their is bipartisan support for increasing semiconductor manufacturing domestically.

How Terrifying is the Start of August?,20,1el42sg,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1el42sg/how_terrifying_is_the_start_of_august/,11,2024-08-06 06:05:43,"Just over the past three trading days, the Dow Jones, Nasdaq, and S&P 500 indices have all recorded their largest three-day cumulative decline since June 2022! Last night, the Nasdaq plummeted by over 6% at one point, and the S&P 500 dropped by more than 4%, with both indices returning to their early May levels by the close of trading.

Although the major U.S. indices and individual stocks still closed with significant losses, the intraday declines were somewhat moderated. The primary reason for this was the release of the U.S. July ISM Non-Manufacturing Index, which rebounded from a four-year low in June to 51.4, exceeding market expectations and returning to the expansion zone above 50!

Sub-indices, including the New Orders Index and Employment Index, also showed growth. Notably, the Employment Index reached 51.1, marking the largest increase since September of last year and the first time this year that it has entered the expansion zone above 50. This data slightly alleviated fears from last week's significant non-farm payroll decline, making the market believe that the drop in new jobs was primarily due to Hurricane Barry hitting Texas.

üëâ As discussed previously, the sharp decline in U.S. stocks at the start of August stemmed from worries about the U.S. economy falling into recession. Therefore, when the ISM Non-Manufacturing number showed growth yesterday, it somewhat restored market confidence in the economy, helping to narrow the intraday losses of U.S. stocks. The U.S. stock market now needs to see positive economic growth news to recover, unlike before when everyone was hoping for bad news, anticipating a Federal Reserve interest rate cut!

Hence, it is crucial to continue monitoring other economic data. If strong and robust growth numbers do not consistently appear, investors will remain concerned about an economic recession, and the trend of selling stocks for cash will not end. The VIX Fear Index is a crucial indicator to observe market sentiment calming down. It surged above 55 in early trading, a level not seen since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020!

Dell's new PowerEdge XE9680L server comes with direct liquid cooling and sports eight Nvidia Blackwell Tensor Core GPUs. GPUs are increasingly power data centers ‚Äî in favor of the more traditional CPUs created by Intel (INTC), AMD (AMD) and others ‚Äî as they are better capable of handling for AI workloads.



""Organizations are moving quickly to capture the AI opportunity, which is why our collaboration with NVIDIA is so important,"" Dell founder and Chief Executive Officer Michael Dell said in a statement. ""Our expansion of the Dell AI Factory with NVIDIA continues our joint mission ‚Äì we're making it easy for organizations to implement AI so they can move boldly into this next technological revolution.""



""Generative AI requires a new type of computing infrastructure ‚Äì an AI factory that produces intelligence,"" Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang added. ""Together, NVIDIA and Dell are providing the world's industries with a full-stack offering ‚Äì including computing, networking and software ‚Äì that drives the copilots, coding assistants, virtual customer service agents and industrial digital twins of the digital enterprise.""



Dell and Nvidia are also working on the Dell AI Factory in an effort to speed AI adoption and innovation, the two companies said in the statement.



Nvidia announced its new Blackwell line of GPUs in March, receiving much acclaim from Wall Street.

Hope there are at least a few people here and/or in /r/stocks who profited off of AKAM one of the three times I mentioned the stock \[1\]! Still a ton of upside here, I am still buying options and straight up stock (per my portfolio specs) when I can.

On the plus side, **they struck a deal 42d ago** with the largest ISP in India \[2\]; who knows what upside that will bring... seriously, if you know feel free to DM me ;)

While AKAM keeps mooning for the foreseeable future I am thinking perhaps long on Cogent Communications. The acquisition of T-Mobile's hard line business increases their service footprint pretty dramatically and integrating those data centers and routing capabilities within their more modern infrastructure might just eventually bring them to ANET level. Being in the computer industry myself I know the big guys avoid lock-in from the get-go making it as easy as unplugging computers in one location and plugging them back in at another, aside from some light configuration tasks... so CCOI might be able to strike some big deals now after integrating the new infra. Having been in a cogent data center I can tell y'all that they have an eye for sophistication (crazy redundancy measures, secured & gated parking lots, impressive client lists)... perhaps with this acquisition they will be able to offer larger footprints in a more bulk-like fashion \~\~instead of\~\~ alongside the premium, cutting-edge, high-security infrastructure, perhaps placing them closer to an ANET-level infrastructure provider.

Growth definitely won't be near AKAM so I am mainly just using CCOI as a diversification option right now.

-90% on entire portfolio since nov last year. ~60k -> 7k. Boy I'm bad at this,159,u24yrz,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/u24yrz/90_on_entire_portfolio_since_nov_last_year_60k_7k/,66,2022-04-12 23:18:32,"I'm based in South America, so everything you'll see here is ten times as painful than if I was in a place where USD were not worth as much.

How do you lose so much money? Well, don't buy stocks, only risky options.

At some point I also quadrupled my money on QCOM, but somehow, after that I just started getting fucked on every position non-stop.

And here is a meme I made back when stuff went bad, I could've never imagined it would get THIS bad:

[Oh god that was a bad week](https://preview.redd.it/nk73dxubv4t81.png?width=463&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac2d6a3e688a7298449e24fecff075b5d97b76f7)

The one thing I did right was to gamble away money I could afford to lose. I'm still buying my own place, but damn this hurts.

I got blinded by the idea of ""if I multiply my money, then I can stop working!"", and by doing that, I added between 1-2 years of work to my life just to break even.

At first it was fun, and then it was just dread, pure dread.

The nail in the coffin was last week, where I lost like 10k+ in spy puts. It just never went down, of course it went down the week after. Why not buy longer expiries? Cause I'm an idiot apparently.

The current state of my account is truly the definition of sad:

&#x200B;

The original idea when I was hovering at 30k was to make it all back up and post the redemption arc of me getting my money back and just going into a boomer ETF and forgetting. Sadly, no happy ending (at least not yet). But I can't prevent my dudes from some nice porn loss. If you ask me, I would consider this ""creampie"" loss porn. Don't ask why.

I still have 7.5k, and I know that I can make it all back, but when I was at 30k I felt the same, and look where I am now, so... maybe I'll just stop and come back to the whole thing in 2023 or IDK.

The course of action from here on out as I see it is:- A) Keep doing whatever I'm doing and trade my way to 0- B) Stop and come back in the future, hopefully with a more reasonable market and make at least some of it back (ignoring opportunity cost).

Thank you for reading. Suggestions, insults, feedback, insults, ideas and encouragement is much appreciated.

Absolute unrelated sidenote: Has anyone considered buying straddles of near ATM options 15 minutes to expiry on SPX (they are cash settled so no collateral needed)? Last friday I was looking at the buy button for like 8k worth of puts, it would have netted around 43k, making me back almost all my money at that point, but no balls dude, fuck."

As promised, this is the Research Request thread.  

**I have access to Moody's, S&P, Morgan Stanley, ~~Credit Suisse~~ (might be banned after calling the sales guy a fucking pussy, need to check), JP Morgan, Citigroup, Barclays, ~~Jefferies (I think)~~, and the all mighty (LUL) Goldman Sachs.** I will do my best to go thru them for all names. Interestingly, I left out Bloomberg research cause they aggregate a bunch of garbage and polish it up and call it ""due diligence"". Bloomberg is company that aggregates real time information and they are good at that, but their research is subpar for my experience. If you really want BB research for a stock let me know otherwise I'm sticking with the investment banks.

Do you see other chip manufacturing companies following the same path as NVDA due to open competition?,0,15xlzjj,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/15xlzjj/do_you_see_other_chip_manufacturing_companies/,46,2023-08-22 03:44:09,"The demand for NVIDIA (NVDA) chips is at an all-time high due to the growing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) across industries. NVIDIA is a leading AI chipmaker with a strong track record of innovation, and as a result, it is facing soaring demand.

However, there are other chipmakers that are also developing AI chips, such as AMD, MU, and QCOM. These companies are investing heavily in research and development, and they are gradually closing the gap with NVIDIA. It is possible that one of these companies will eventually produce chips that are just as good as or even better than NVIDIA's chips.

If I had to place my money on a company other than NVIDIA, I would choose AMD. AMD has been making significant strides in the AI chip market in recent years, and it has a strong portfolio of products that are well-positioned to compete with NVIDIA. AMD is also more affordable than NVIDIA, which could give it an edge in the market.

Ultimately, the future of the AI chip market is uncertain. NVIDIA is the clear leader today, but other companies are making inroads. It is possible that the market will eventually become more competitive, and that one of these companies will surpass NVIDIA.

**So, if you had to invest in a chipmaker other than NVIDIA, which company would you choose?**

I would love to hear your thoughts on this."
"Tell your conspiratorial uncle to go yodel on a chode, 5G commin', and we makin' tendies",131,kw6mt6,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kw6mt6/tell_your_conspiratorial_uncle_to_go_yodel_on_a/,94,2021-01-13 07:43:53,"What up fart quaffers! I've got some truly mas puro retard shit for you guys to snort like a line of coarsely ground Adderall. So scooch your beanbags up and gather 'round my little dick strokers and bean flickers (see? I can be gender inclusive). Let's discuss why your uncle is more retarded than you and how you're gonna make money while he sends his social security checks to buy more tin foil.

First, let me say, if your illiterate ass isn't here for story time, just skip to the bottom. TL;DR and my positions are that'a'way.

So, by now many of you probably know that the 5G spectrums are up for auction. Verizon and T-Mobile (and to a lesser extent, AT&T -- because they is over-leveraged bitches) are gonna be throwing 90's money at it. Gonna make it rain like Jenna Jameson feature dancing at some vaporwave strip club in Tampa circa '97. Now, before you start jizzing all over your JNCO jeans, that's not the money we're after here. There's a bigger pot about to be busted out, and that, goons and goblins, is what we're aiming for.

You see, your Kool-aide drinking uncle is right about something: 5G is gonna be massive, and who the fuck cares if Bill gates is gonna use it to give us microchip suppositories while infecting us with the Rona. You'll live, and you'll make money while your uncle keeps shouting at clouds and chemtrails, poor and destitute. If only the bastard weren't as cruel as he is retarded, you might use those tendies to put him in a nice home for retards, somewhere warm, like Florida. He'd fit right in.

What's the difference between 4G and 5G? Fuck if I know, do I look like an electronics nerd? But I do know this: rather than building one big ass tower that covers a large area, 5G is gonna use a bunch of Christmas-tree sized towers and spread them over several city blocks. You hear that? What once was one tower, is now many. Is your retarded brain starting to piece this shit together? You know what you need to get all those towers and all that data talking to each other? Muthafucking switches. Yes, basically a shittier version of the router that's collecting dust while half-dangling off your desk. So, picture this, I'm sitting at the table in my crayon room, trying to force the square peg into the round hole, when I ask myself, ""which cunt makes 5G switches?"" Well, I put my big boy pants on and started looking at Chinese shit...emphasis on ""shit"".

You see, as a younger autist, I once lived in China. I even have a degree in their retarded ass laws (omfg, their constitution is such hot garbage, it's like someone put Trump tweets through a Communist formal language translator, seriously, if you're at all interested in law, go read it and laugh/weep) from one of their retarded universities. There are three facts that made me realize that China is not the answer to this.

1.) Chinese quality is fucking shit. I don't need no wumao apologists coming in here and telling me I'm wrong, because I'm not. Chinese craftsmanship is is like what you'd produce if I asked you personally to bake a 3-tiered cake, and then allowed you to frost it with Play-doh. Everything is about cutting corners and covering it up with plastic, it sucks. Look at Ze Germans, they're over there salting their pretzels with tears ""because ze machine do not look sexy enough. Mutti whas rite, I am failure!"" Meanwhile, in China, they're wiping their tears with fermented tofu because they can't put poison into powdered milk (you think I'm joking?!).

2. Not only is Chinese quality fucking shit, it's riddled with goddamn spyware. You know who is not gonna be cool with putting up a bunch-of Christmas tree-sized Chinese spies on every rooftop? Hopefully fucking everybody (well, except Saudi Arabia, we all know they'll just pay China to have a seat at the peepshow.). But for real, President Xi has dramatically failed to engage in the world in good faith. His predecessors were able to build good will and investment opportunities with the West, but ever since Xi took over, he's been pissing in Cheerios. Indiscretions won't be waved away as ""aww, look at that little shithole trying to pull itself up by the bootstraps"" anymore. Nah, we saw what happened with Huawei, and we saw China nationalize Jack Ma's shit. It's gonna go more in this direction under Xi, and Chinese supply, especially as it relates to data and information tech is only gonna be favored by jackboot cum guzzlers.

3. IT'S ALL FAKE GOVERNEMNT MANIPULATION. Let me tell you a story about my time in Poohland. You see, if you want to open your Retards'R'Us store in China, you gotta do the same bureaucratic bullshit like you do everywhere, file your paperwork and wait. But if you don't fucking offer a bribe, your ass is gonna go broke waiting. It's a goddamn institution. They got these stores, all they got inside is expensive whiskey and cartons of Marlboros that were made in 1987. No one ever buys from these stores because their prices are straight up ridiculous and who the fuck wants to smoke ciggies from back then, but yet, there they are. What purpose do they serve? Well, when you go turn in your business application, you swing by one of these stores, pick up a carton of Marlboros that Ronald Regan farted on and make your way to either a.) some dingy ass Soviet dystopia looking ass building or b.) some super fancy and slick building that's got welds so shitty it look's like they tried to do them with chopsticks. Either way, when you slide your application across the desk, slide that carton of Marlboros and whiskey too.  You know what fuckface on the other side does with it? He goes right back to the goddamn store you were in 20 minutes ago and trades that shit for cash.  You know what else happens? That store, and the thousands, if not millions, like it pump those numbers into the economic reports. Lord knows how much of their GDP is straight up due to corruption. I'm not even gonna begin to get into how the CCP manipulates markets and businesses, all you need to know is you can make a quick buck off Chinese shit, but ultimately, you're holding fake ass doo doo that ""fell of the back of the truck"".

Alright, so we veered a little off course there, but I say all that because I'm gonna make the case for my boy, ERIC. You see, ERIC is Swedish. Sweden isn't pissing in anyone's Cheerios, they're like the Canada of Europe. When you think Sweden, you think about a strange fascination with fermented fish, kinda creepy avant-garde movies, and fucking STACKED blonde bikini models. Take me to Valhalla, you Swedish valkyries...and sit on my face while you do it. Sweden is the guy at the rave dressed in khakis asking how your family is doing and making sure everyone gets home safely. Cool dude, sk√•l! You know what you would trust this motherfucker to do? That's right you degenerates, you'd trust him to handle your fucking n00die pics. He won't judge, and he won't share. So let's go hang out with ERIC for a moment, he's got some meatballs and needs our help assembling flat-pack furniture.

You see, ERIC's been a busy lad. You old Millennials and young Gen-Xers might have even had a Sony-Ericcsson phone back when nobody knew what the fuck a Yu-Gi-Oh is. Sonny and ERIC dipped outta that scene when smartphones arrived and their bromance came to an end. But ERIC is a nerd for this shit. ERIC kept making comm tech when he wasn't too buys causing air traffic incidents with Surstr√∂mming. You know what his hard work got him? Fucking becoming a pioneer in 5G tech. As far as I'm aware, ERIC is the only muthafucka to have his shit on 4 continents (so far). ERIC got in this door early, and unlike that Chinese shit, it's good fucking quality and not trying to exploit you. Furthermore, EU is gonna love supporting one of their own, especially after Xi been pissing in Mama Merkel's Cheerios. America too is gonna start being more suspicious of China, we've seen it happen, but fucking ERIC? ERIC's cool man, he ain't pissing in our Cheerios, we ain't got beef with him handling data. Our drunk girlfriend tried to hook up with him, but he just took her to get some Mickey D's. Class fucking act, real stand-up dude.

But alright, we know ERIC is cool, and that he isn't gonna threaten to send our dick pic collection to our mamas. We know that ERIC has been making something that is about to be in high-demand, and that he is quite good at it. We also know he has been busy getting his product out across the world ahead of his competitors, and that his biggest competitors produce snitch-ass dogshit.

Yeah, just swiping through WSB Tinder, ERIC looking kinda juicy. Let's see what his bio says. Oh shit dawgs, are you seeing these charts? That steady growth. Look at how that sonuvabitch just shrugged off COVID and kept going all viking on his shit. Not only did ERIC shrug off COVID, he fucking feasted on it. Look at that j√§vel make his money. And what's this? The motherfucker is integrating automated drone corridors with his tech? He's raising his long-term EBITDA margins? He's out here acquiring businesses? Shit, that muthafucking Swede been a busy ass bee.

Now, you may be wondering, if ERIC is so great, what about NOK? And yeah, NOK isn't a terrible idea either, they also have some good news on their side and are a bit undervalued as well. If you wanted to take a bite of NOK, you probably won't get diarrhea, might even shit some gold. I dunno, I'm still looking into it, but I like ERIC better.

But here is the part I want you to really look at: the fucking call prices. Cheddar Cheesus of Wisconsin! That's some muthafucking value on a goddamn motherfucker leading the game! Goddamn Buddha going down on Shakira in the Alps! If you don't make money on this, you're fucking hopeless.

So yeah, there you have it, ERIC is the fucking man. He's got a good product, is ahead of the game in rolling it out, has geo-political tailwinds, solid and steady growth, and his only opposition is your retarded uncle and his looney-toons conspiracies. So this is the part where you tell him to go whistle on a dick because you're making money off the switches that ensure that the camgirl you've been simping for sees your little dick 150 miliseconds faster. 5G is coming, and someone's gotta make the hardware for it, why not ERIC?

&#x200B;

TL;DR Chinese shit is shit. ERIC is cool. You should give your money to ERIC

&#x200B;

ERIC shares

ERIC Jan 2023 $12c

&#x200B;

P.S. I'm putting this at the bottom because I already know my inbox will be full of: ""Is Jan 15 a good call date?"" No motherfucker! The telecomms are just now bidding on the spectrums. I have no fucking clue when they'll actually start putting up the goddamn towers, if I did, I sure as shit wouldn't be giving that info out for free. But I do know it won't happen over night. If you wanna be retarded, go play a meme stock, this shit is for autists. No rocket emojis here. So when is a good date for calls? Fuck if I know. Noticed I bought fucking leaps? Yeah, you might wanna do the same (they're dirt cheap), but I tend to think anything expiring in June-Sept and beyond is a safe bet. Totally your call based on your own risk tolerance.

&#x200B;

Anyway, if you see my boy ERIC, just ignore the pungent smell of fermented fish."

Earnings from Taiwan Semiconductor are due Thursday before open. TSM stock is down sharply, more than 50% off its high as of Friday‚Äôs close, after a breakout attempt from a shallow cup base in January quickly failed.

TSM stock slumped 6% Friday despite reporting better-than-expected September sales.

Sellers have hit the stock hard despite several quarters in a row of robust earnings and revenue growth.

For the third quarter, profit is seen surging 56% to $1.69 share, with revenue up 40% to $20.83 billion.

The company has some high-profile customers, including Apple (AAPL), which accounted for about 25% of revenue in 2021. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Qualcomm (QCOM), Broadcom (AVGO) and Nvidia (NVDA) are also big customers.

Semiconductors for Dummies (TL;DR buy TSM $65C 4/17),144,f6k556,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6k556/semiconductors_for_dummies_tldr_buy_tsm_65c_417/,93,2020-02-20 05:41:55,"Alright fellow autismos listen up. If the beer virus doesn't tank the market this is freest money you will ever see. Semiconductor stocks are way up, AMD and NVDA are printing like crazy. AAPL is still putting up impressive numbers in spite of the guidance adjustment they just gave. As some of you may know most of the big semiconductors are reliant on three companies. Here's a chart to show where the money goes:

https://i.imgur.com/lSB6Psm.png

Global Foundries is a private fabricator (sorry no tendies on these guys), they focus on the older 14nm process (they tried 7nm and gave up because they found it was unaffordable to outfit a plant to fab the chips. Because of this IBM switched to Samsung for it's next-gen chips). Intel is also famously struggling to get 7nm up and running. Only two companies really have play in the 7nm space, Samsung and TSMC (traded as TSM) Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. TSMC is largest dedicated semiconductor foundry in the world. Nvidia, AMD, and Apple all buy chips from TSMC. The more each of these companies is in demand, the more money TSMC makes. Their competition is weak right now, Samsung Semiconductor is huge, but you can't invest in them, and they only really make chips for their phones sold outside the US. Though Samsung did just recently win over Qualcomm, they will be splitting this deal with TSMC. Samsung also sells chips to IBM, but those chips are for supercomputers, servers, and mainframes, not for consumers. Samsung mostly focuses on DRAM and SSDs. TSMC is in a position right now where it is indispensable to a lot of the world's largest corporations (Alphabet, Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon all use TSMC products). Literally can't go tits up. Right now all these companies are on an absolute tear. TSMC announces earnings on April 16th and option prices are ripe. Go get them tendies boiz.

In short, TSMC splitting QCOM 5nm with Samsung. TSMC locked in 5nm A14 Bionic for AAPL, 7nm Big Navi for AMD, and 7nm Ampere for NVDA. They are also expanding rapidly to meet the rising global demand for chips. PS5 and Xbox Series X chips are also produced by them. They are selling chips faster than they can make them.

Edit: Forgot to mention Huawei is about to surpass Apple to become TSMCs biggest customer. Also TSMC and Global Foundries were in a patent feud for a while that was locking both companies up. They have decided to call a patent truce and won't have to worry about any restrictions for the next decade.

Why I am buying the dip this month (and you probably should too),57,t3w22w,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/t3w22w/why_i_am_buying_the_dip_this_month_and_you/,62,2022-03-01 07:17:57,"We are in a crazy phase of the market. The volatility is incredible, and people have been struggling to price in multiple fears at the same time. I have made really good money off puts the last 2 months but I will be slowly switching to calls over the next month. The data shows the 12 months after the first rate hikes are always green (so far). Take this with a grain of salt because 2018 was not included (they were negative on the year due to a trade war)

The data also shows the ""bottom"" occurs right before the invasion has occurred. Now obviously if other countries get involved, this could go lower. This doesn't take into account multiple invasions. That's why I'll slowly be DCA over the next month.

Positions will be heavy into TSM calls, LCID puts, QCOM, AMD, and GOOGL. Buy when people are fearful has worked since my first year of ""investing"" in 2018, and I won't stop now. Good luck!"
