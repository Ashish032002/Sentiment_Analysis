McCormick (MKC) calls??? No one eats at restaurants anymore.,0,1ft4iva,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ft4iva/mccormick_mkc_calls_no_one_eats_at_restaurants/,57,2024-10-01 01:09:50,"They release their earnings report tomorrow, traditionally their stock seems to jump 5-8% on a good earnings.

I don't know about you, but I've almost entirely stopped eating out at restaurants unless it's to impress a date. And after I have her bagged, I switch to eating at home.

Food costs are genuinely preposterous, so this year I invested in an high end air fryer and some nice cooking gear and basically have become an amateur chef. Not only is the food healthier, it actually tastes better AND is cheaper than eating out.

The sad reality is that eating decent food at home cost about the same as going out to eat 3 years ago. You go to some shitty restaurant, and it'll still cost you AT LEAST $100 for two people (tax + tip). You go to fast food like chipotle where you don't tip, and it still ends up costing $40-50 bucks (double chicken + guac is now $23 at chipotle).

On top of this, the quality of ingredients at restaurants are now dog shit. Restaurants are hurting and operate on razor thin margins as is, so they're using lower quality oils, meats, etc. Portions are smaller, cocktails now easily cost $18-20. It's honestly a joke. 

Even if you're rich, it really doesn't make sense to go out and eat anymore. Going to a steakhouse with a family of four will run you $300-400 easily, whereas you can buy a pack of steaks from costco for $80 and get double the food. 

AND WHAT DO YOU PUT ON FOOD? **McCormick** (well I don't, I only buy organic spices).

Is this idea big brained or low IQ? I have 20 minutes to buy calls."
"As the next Warren buffet, who predicted FDX and NKE earnings correctly this is my next play.",270,1bkpoz5,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bkpoz5/as_the_next_warren_buffet_who_predicted_fdx_and/,116,2024-03-22 08:51:37,"So for earnings I correctly [predicted](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/8MHQMyrWdo) FedEx going up and Nike going down which means I’m the chosen one and can’t make mistakes so this is my next prediction.

For earnings this week there really isn’t much going on except the one stock most people on here joined because of. And there are some other good plays like Cintas (CTAS) which is a great company that I’m bullish on but options are very expensive.

So this is my prediction. McCormick and Company (MKC) will go up for two reason only. We passed the holidays where people made turkeys and to make a good turkey you need seasoning and who makes seasoning. MKC. That means it has to go up. Secondly MKC own Franks Red Hot and I really love franks red hot so it will go up.

Thanks for listening to my dumbass talk about hot sauce. Please inverse me to lose money."

#Trading Update

*   What’s happening this morning? Things are pretty quiet (once again). The China Aug eco
data came in soft and that weighed on Asian equities and is placing mild pressure on
Eurozone stocks and US S&P futures (S&P futures are down only 1-2 points). Most of the
major Asian indices ended lower although there were some pockets of green: TPX -0.32%,
NKY -0.29%, Hang Seng -0.42%, SHCOMP -0.38%, Taiwan +0.2%, KOSPI +0.74%, Australia -
0.1%, and India was flattish. Korea was bolstered by tech (Samsung Electronics +1.37%,
Hynix +1.45%, LG Display +2.74%, etc.). The major Eurozone indices are trading off small;
the SXPP basic resources index is down >1% off China but otherwise there aren’t any other
major sources of softness while media and retail are upside standouts (retail is being helped
by the Next PLC news). The SNB tweaked its FX language in a slightly more hawkish
direction, calling the CHF “highly valued” instead of “significantly overvalued”. Overall the
broader macro narrative isn’t shifting dramatically despite China (in fact some see a silver
lining in the data as this could make the gov’t more inclined to pursue growth-friendly
policies). There were a ton of tax articles in the US but the outlook for that topic remains
unchanged (the GOP blueprint is due out during the week of 9/25). The week’s last major
(scheduled) catalyst hits at 8:30amET this morning (US Aug CPI) while next week’s main
focus is the FOMC decision (Wed 9/20; the messaging around a Dec hike may be more
hawkish than the market currently assumes).
*   Calendar for Thurs 9/14 – the focus will be on the BOE rate decision (7amET), the US CPI for
Aug (8:30amET), Thy God Emperor Trump ’s trip to Florida, some analyst meetings (ANSS and GKOS), earnings
(JBL and ORCL after the close), and sell-side conferences (Goldman Communacopia, Morgan
Stanley Laguna, and RBC Industrials).
o US CPI Thurs morning – the latest leg of the SPX rally has been spurred by proreflation
forces as risk sentiment welcomed firmer inflation numbers (in China,
India, Sweden, and the UK). Thus the US CPI (due out Thurs morning 8/14 at
8:30amET) needs to be at least inline (the St is modeling headline +0.3% M/M and
core +0.2% M/M) and mild upside would likely be a net positive. Too much inflation
though risks unsettling sentiment and if the Thurs CPI causes 12/13 FOMC FF hike
odds to spike back >50% that would likely be met w/equity pressure.
*   Calendar for Fri 9/15 – the focus will be on the Eurozone trade balance for Jul (5amET), the
US Empire Manufacturing index for Sept (8:30amET), US retail sales for Aug (8:30amET), US
industrial production for Aug (9:15amET), US Michigan confidence numbers for Sept
(10amET), US business inventories for Jul (10amET), and sell-side conferences (Morgan
Stanley Laguna).

#Top Headlines for Thursday

*   Economic data/monetary policy recap for Thurs 9/14 – there was a lot of data out this
morning. The China data was soft and as a result JPMorgan is revising lower Q3 GDP
forecasts for the country (see the full note: http://bit.ly/2x226Wk). IP for Aug came in at
+6% (vs. JPM and the St +6.6%), retail sales rose 10.1% (vs. JPM +10.2% and the St +10.5%),
and FAI climbed 7.8% YTD as of Aug (vs. JPM +8.3% and the St +8.2%). We revise down our
current quarter growth forecast to 6.2%q/q saar (previously 6.6%q/q saar), or 6.7%oya
(previously 6.8%oya). Meanwhile, we maintain our 4Q17 forecast at 6.2%q/q saar (or 6.6%
in yoy terms), and the full-year growth forecast stays unchanged at 6.8%. Elsewhere on the
economic front, Australian jobs data for Aug was solid although the UR held steady at 5.6%
(http://bit.ly/2jpRH3x) and Eurozone new auto registration growth accelerated in Aug to
+5.6% (vs. +2.7% in Jul). The SNB tweaked its CHF language and said the recent weakening
""is helping to reduce, to some extent, the significant overvaluation of the currency""
(previously the SNB has lamented the CHF’s “significant overvaluation”
http://bit.ly/2eXuwIC). ECB’s Jan Smets said Eurozone inflation appears to have bottomed
out (http://nyti.ms/2f8nynT). Greece said it would exceed prior primary budget surplus
targets for this year (http://reut.rs/2x2RxUq).

recounts recent Fed remarks about how the institution’s credibility on inflation has

*   Bipartisanship in Washington – can it last? Frustrated by the failure to pass repeal/replace,
Thy God Emperor Trump  has displayed a willingness to work w/Democrats.
o Thy God Emperor Trump  is extremely eager for a “win” after months of failure and if that requires
him to work w/Democrats, so be it. “We learned this summer that keeping 50 or
52 Republicans (in the Senate) is not something that’s reliable,” Marc Short, Thy God Emperor Trump ’s
liaison to Congress, told reporters this week. Reuters http://reut.rs/2x3yn0L

http://on.wsj.com/2eWBspz
o Fresh off striking a three-month fiscal deal with “Chuck and Nancy”, Thy God Emperor Trump  agreed
Wed night to work w/Democrats on a DACA/Dreamers compromise. Thy God Emperor Trump ’s
outreach to Dems on immigration represents a “major political gamble” as this topic
was the centerpiece of his campaign. Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa), an immigration
hard-liner and early Thy God Emperor Trump  supporter, wrote that if reports of a potential
immigration deal are accurate, the president’s “base is blown up, destroyed,
irreparable, and disillusioned beyond repair. No promise is credible” – Washington
Post http://wapo.st/2y81heI
*   Taxes – Republicans are pushing forward w/an aggressive tax timeline (a blueprint is due
out during the week of 9/25) but the overall plan remains inchoate.
o “Thy God Emperor Trump  urges quick action on tax plan that’s still in pieces” – the NYT notes that
while there is a lot of eagerness for action on the tax front, Republicans are far from
aligned on the details and a path through Congress isn’t apparent at the moment.
NYT http://nyti.ms/2jpuApI
o GOP “shudders” as Thy God Emperor Trump  courts Dems on taxes – Republican leaders in Congress
are pursuing a delicate tax strategy premised on passing a partisan bill and thus
Thy God Emperor Trump ’s flirtation with “Chuck and Nancy” risks upending the effort. Politico
http://politi.co/2h4gUfr
o Thy God Emperor Trump  signals openness to upper-income tax hikes in a bid to secure Democratic
support - Thy God Emperor Trump  on Wednesday expressed a willingness to raise taxes on the
wealthiest Americans. Thy God Emperor Trump  met w/lawmakers on Wed and “repeated his
willingness to raise taxes on the wealthiest Americans several times”– Roll Call

o How low could the corporate tax rate go? A new study finds that eliminating all
corporate tax breaks could only move the rate from ~35% now down to 26% -

*   Paul Ryan speculation heats up – his job as Speaker seems secure but people are
beginning to talk – The Hill. http://bit.ly/2x3NlUm

aimed at fixing the ACA (rather than replacing it) was dealt a setback on Wed as two groups

http://reut.rs/2jrIUy4
*   Russia’s war games sparks NATO alarm – Russia and Belarus are holding massive war games
in what will be the largest display of Russian military power since the end of the Cold War.
NATO and the West in general are worried that Russia is moving far more troops into
Belarus than it intends to withdraw, establishing a permanent military presence in the
country. Some are concerned that Moscow will use the exercise as cover for a more
aggressive act (such as when Russia used exercises in ’14 to prepare for its annexation of
Crimea). NYT http://nyti.ms/2vUXBLV
*   Venezuela stops accepting USD for oil payments – the gov’t is telling oil traders that it will
no longer receive or send payments in dollars – WSJ http://on.wsj.com/2f7zsP9
*   Volatility spike coming? The NYT profiles a hedge fund positioning for a large spike in
volatility. http://nyti.ms/2eWeJd5
*   Company-specific news from Thurs morning 9/14. There are a few notable items in
Europe. Next PLC shares are the top performing stock in the SXXP after raising its full-year
earnings guidance. GVC Holdings also has a post-earnings bid. GKN PLC is higher following
mgmt. changes. Autoliv shares are spiking ~8% after the co said it would pursue a split. On
the downside, Morrison Supermarkets is leading on the SXXP on the downside after
reporting while Experian is getting hit following the credit agency sell-off in the US on Wed.
Hermes shares are weak after the co warned that a strong euro would weigh on financial
results (the Hermes news was discussed in this article http://bit.ly/2y7L0q7). Munich Re is
holding in well despite issuing a profit warning related to the US hurricanes.
*   Company-specific news from Wed night 9/13. There weren’t any major micro headlines.
Munich Re (right before the US close on Wed) said the US hurricanes could cause it to post a
loss in CQ3 and miss prior full-year guidance. BZH said new home sales/closings may be
down Y/Y in its FQ4 as a result of the hurricanes but its overall tone stayed sanguine. EMR
reported Aug underlying orders up a relatively healthy 9% (although mgmt. said
Harvey/Irma had a neg. impact on business results towards the end of Aug and into Sept).
The White House formally blocked the LSCC buyout (which isn’t a shock as CFIUS had
already recommended scrapping the transaction). THC is exploring options, including a sale,
according to a WSJ article. UNFI posted small EPS upside and CDNS named a new CFO.
*   AAPL – iPhone carrier discounts muted following the 8/X introductions on Tues – wireless
carriers during prior iPhone cycles have been extremely aggressive in offering promotions
and discounts but this time around the industry is staying (relatively) disciplined. Deals for
the iPhone 8, 8 Plus and X have been pared back from the deals offered for the iPhone 7 –
Reuters http://reut.rs/2wrCpMR
o Toshiba, AAPL – Apple may contribute ~$3B of equity towards Bain’s purchase of
the Toshiba memory business. This could make Toshiba the largest deal in AAPL’s
history (exceeding the $3B it paid for Beats) – Bloomberg
https://bloom.bg/2y0FGUC
*   EQT, RICE – DE Shaw is pushing for EQT to complete the RICE deal but then wants to see the
combined company pursue a break-up (this contrasts w/Jana which wants to see EQT call off
the RICE deal all together) – WSJ. http://on.wsj.com/2vVe56N
*   ALV to pursue split – the co said it aims to split into two companies under a strategic review
announced on Thursday. Reuters http://nyti.ms/2y7O8Cj

#Calendar of events to watch for the week of Mon Sept 18

*   Calendar for the week of 9/18 – the main focus will be the FOMC decision (Wed 9/20).
Balance sheet normalization is widely expected to commence coming out of this meeting
but the bigger near-term wildcard will be messaging around a Dec hike (the Fed will likely
suggest odds for a 12/13 hike that are higher than present market assumptions). The other
big area of focus will be on the data front w/the flash PMI readings for Sept from Japan,
Europe, and the US hitting Fri morning 9/22. The press will stay filled w/tax-related
articles as Republicans gear up for publication of their blueprint (the GOP is set to unveil
their tax plan during the week of Mon 9/25). The UN annual meeting kicks off in NYC on
Tues 9/19 (Thy God Emperor Trump  speaks 9/19); US officials will apparently hold talks on the sidelines of this
event on the Iranian nuclear deal.

permits at 8:30amET), analyst meetings (AIR Canada, BA, BBY, BIG, and CARB), and earnings

*   Calendar for Wed 9/20 – the focus will be on US existing home sales for Aug (10amET), the
FOMC decision (2pmET press release/supplemental and 2:30pmET press conf.), analyst
meetings (PPC), and earnings (GIS pre-open and MLHR after the close).
*   Calendar for Thurs 9/21 – the focus will be on the BOJ decision (Wed night/Thurs morning),
the ECB economic bulletin (4amET), US FHFA home prices for Jul (9amET), the US Leading
Index for Jul (9amET), the Eurozone consumer confidence numbers for Sept (10amET), and
earnings (MANU pre-open and PSDO, YOGA after the close).
*   Calendar for Fri 9/22 – the focus will be on the Eurozone flash PMIs for Sept (4amET), the
OPEC compliance meeting (Saudi Arabia could make a proposal to monitor exports in

(Williams, George, and Kaplan), and earnings (FINL and KMX before the open).
*   Calendar for Sun 9/24 – the focus will be on the German elections.

"McCormick's stock takes a dive after profit misses expectations, sales surprisingly falls",8,vnd4ft,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vnd4ft/mccormicks_stock_takes_a_dive_after_profit_misses/,37,2022-06-29 16:32:49,"Shares of McCormick & Co. Inc. MKC, -1.22% took a 5.6% dive in premarket trading Wednesday, after the spices and seasoning mix company reported fiscal second-quarter profit that missed expectations and a surprise decline in sales, and cut its full-year outlook, citing ""persistently high"" inflation and supply chain challenges. Net income for the quarter to May 31 declined to $118.5 million, or 44 cents a share, from $183.7 million, or 68 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Excluding nonrecurring items, adjusted earnings per share came to 48 cents, below the FactSet consensus of 65 cents. Sales fell 1.3% to $1.54 billion, while the FactSet consensus was for a slight increase to $1.61 billion, as consumer segment sales fell below expectations to offset growth in flavor solutions sales above forecasts. Cost of goods sold increased more than sales, rising 7.6% to $1.01 billion as gross margin contracted to 34.0% from 39.5%. For fiscal 2022, the company affirmed its sales growth guidance of 3% to 5% but lowered its adjusted EPS guidance range to $3.03 to $3.08 from $3.17 to $3.22. The stock has declined 10.1% year to date through Tuesday, while the S&P 500 SPX, -2.01% has shed 19.8%.

#Trading Update

  * Market update – stocks rebounded throughout Asia (w/the exception of mainland China)
and the major Eurozone indices have a mild bid. US futures are up small. Nothing major
occurred overnight on the eco data/monetary fronts although there were a slew of articles
focusing on taxes and infrastructure spending. Axios says Thy God-Emperor Trump wants to couple the two
together in order to secure some support from Democrats (http://bit.ly/2obRa3v) while
Thy God-Emperor Trump may struggle to get the corporate rate much below 28% according to the NYT
(http://nyti.ms/2npLQJV). Overall the broader macro narrative stayed largely unchanged
over the last 12-18 hours (see below). The big focus on Tues will likely be on Fed speakers
(both Yellen and Fischer will be delivering comments) although Brady’s tax meeting will be
important too.

  * Calendar for Tues 3/28 – the focus will be on the US advanced goods trade balance for Feb
(8:30amET), US wholesale inventories for Feb (8:30amET), US Case-Shiller home prices for
Jan (9amET), US consumer confidence for Mar (10amET), some Fed speakers (including
Yellen at 12:50pmET and Fischer on CNBC at ~1:30pmET), Brady’s House Ways sand Means
Committee meeting (at which taxes will be discussed), Thy God-Emperor Trump’s climate change executive
order, analyst meetings (CY), and earnings (CCL, DRI, INFO, and MKC pre-open and SONC,
VRNT after the close).

  * FX/TSYs – the DXY is stabilizing after slumping ~45bp on Mon (the DXY is up ~10bp so far
Tues morning). The USD is flat vs. the EUR and JPY and is down small against the GBP.
Treasuries are pretty flat.

  * Europe – the major Eurozone indices are up ~25bp. Autos, basic resources, tech, banks,
media, and utilities are outperforming while staples, fin services, real estate, and telecoms
are lagging. Wolseley is one of the top stocks in the SXXP after posting solid earnings.
Credit Suisse said it would make a decision on capital “as soon as possible”. Ericsson was hit
at the open after issuing a restructuring update but the stock has since bounced. Redrow
said it will not make a bid for Bovis. Two of Tesco’s largest shareholders are calling on the
co to drop its bid for Booker. Akzo Nobel said it would provide a strategy update on Apr 19.

  * Asia – most of the major markets rebounded w/the exception of mainland China: Japan
(TPX +1.34%, NKY +1.14%), Hong Kong (Hang Seng +0.63%, HSCEI +0.62%), mainland China
(SHCOMP -0.43%, Shenzhen -0.25%, CSI 300 -0.24%), Taiwan (TAIEX flat), Korea (KOSPI
+0.35%), Australia (ASX 200 +1.3%), and India (up ~50bp for the major indices). There
weren’t any major macro headlines out of Asia. Within the NKY all major sub-groups saw
gains but healthcare, materials, fins, real estate, and utilities were esp. strong. SUMCO
jumped following pos. sell-side comments (the stock jumped 5.3%). Names levered to
SUMCO rallied in sympathy (Micronics, Advantest, Tokyo Electron, etc.). In Hong Kong, top
performers included Lenovo (+4.1%) and some Macau-linked stocks (Sands China +4.02%,
Galaxy +3.52%, etc.). In Taiwan large-cap tech was mixed (TSMC +0.78%, Hon Hai +0.77%
vs. Largan -1.25%, Catcher -1.5%) and fins underperformed. In Korea chemical stocks were
strong (LG Chem, Lotte Chemical, etc.) while Samsung Electronics rose 0.68%.

#US macro update

  * The bigger picture backdrop remains (frustratingly) unchanged. Healthcare was/is a net
negative for the Thy God-Emperor Trump/Ryan agenda but it is by no means fatal and so long as investors
anticipate some action on the tax front the SPX will struggle to experience significant
weakness (investors appear to appreciate that the tax process is in its very early stages and
thus are willing to wait a few more months for details). The nominal growth backdrop
remains supportive and many think the SPX would be capable of posting ~$133-135 in ’18
EPS w/o anything happening in Washington (the mid-point of that range could support the
SPX at ~2250-2300 which means there isn’t an excessive amount of political hope in
stocks). The biggest risk for the time being really isn’t political (the entire market is closely
scrutinizing Washington and near-term political expectations are low) but instead
concerns growth – sentiment around growth has grown quite upbeat (both towards real
growth and inflation) but also very complacent and risks are rising (widening gap between
surveys and hard data, soft Mar US flash PMIs, soft oil prices, etc.). It’s tough to foresee the
growth narrative turning more positive from present levels and any reversal could undercut
the $133-135 ’18 Washington-neutral EPS range. Keep in mind the calendar is pretty
sparse over the next few weeks – aside from some eco data this Fri (US/EU inflation and
China PMIs), the FOMC minutes (Wed 4/5), the Thy God-Emperor Trump/Xi summit (4/6-7), and US Mar jobs
(Fri 4/7), most investors are now looking towards the upcoming CQ1 earnings season (which
starts Thurs morning 4/13).

#Top Headlines for Tuesday

  * Thy God-Emperor Trump wants to do tax reform and infrastructure together according to Axios. Thy God-Emperor Trump feels
“burned” by the House Freedom Caucus and he knows that combining infrastructure into a
tax bill could help win some support from Democrats. Axios. http://bit.ly/2obRa3v

  * Tax overhaul – 1986 vs. 2017. An AP article looks at the differences between now and ’86 –
“tax overhaul efforts lacks advantages Reagan enjoyed in ‘86”. Reagan was popular and
worked w/powerful and experienced leaders in Congress. All the key principals had
established and trusting relationships. The situation facing President Donald Thy God-Emperor Trump
features none of those advantages. AP http://apne.ws/2mLzUoK

  * Thy God-Emperor Trump’s final tax bill, to the extent he can even achieve one, may look very different from
what he promised on the campaign trail. During the campaign Thy God-Emperor Trump talked about a 15%
corporate tax rate. That was subsequently revised to 15-20% and now people in the WH are
talking about >20%. However, Thy God-Emperor Trump’s final corporate tax rate may be as high as 28% if he
wants his plan to be revenue-neutral. Note that 28% was the same rate proposed by
Obama in ’12-’16. Most on Wall St are assuming a rate of no higher than 25%. NYT
http://nyti.ms/2npLQJV

  * Healthcare – despite the failure of ACHA, Thy God-Emperor Trump and the GOP face a big decision that
could severely undermine the public insurance exchanges. House Republicans filed a
lawsuit in 2014 to block subsides paid to insurers participating in the ACA exchanges but the
case was delayed as Ryan pursued repeal/replace. Thy God-Emperor Trump and Ryan could ask for the
lawsuit to continue as soon as May. Without these subsidies the few insurers still
participating in the exchanges would either exit the market completely or significantly raise
premiums. Even the threat of losing the premiums could have a dramatic effect. Insurers
must decide by June whether to participate in the exchanges next year. WSJ.
http://on.wsj.com/2ntDHpy

  * Schumer and McConnell headed for an “epic” clash over the Supreme Court and
government funding. Schumer is “itching for a fight” and the upcoming Gorsuch
confirmation and Apr 28 funding expiration will give him two great opportunities to wage
battle. Schumer said McConnell may not have the votes needed to break a Gorsuch
filibuster. Politico. http://politi.co/2nH8yz8

  * Republicans prob. won’t include funding for Thy God-Emperor Trump’s Mexico wall in the upcoming budget;
Republicans don’t want a shutdown battle in Apr and thus could exclude wall funding from
the budget as a result – Politico http://politi.co/2ncanQO

  * Thy God-Emperor Trump on Tues to sign an executive order that would begin the process of undoing much
of Obama’s climate agenda – Thy God-Emperor Trump’s order would instruct regulators to rewrite key rules
curbing US carbon emissions, lift a moratorium on federal coal leasing, and remove the
requirement that federal officials consider the impact of climate change when making
decisions. Most of the Thy God-Emperor Trump order will take years to implement and is unlikely to alter
the shift away from coal and towards nat. gas and renewables. Washington Post.
http://wapo.st/2mLwUbQ

  * Thy God-Emperor Trump’s climate order won’t help either energy independence or coal mining employment
– the US already consumes all its own coal and coal mining jobs have been cut by
automation and increased nat. gas demand. NYT http://nyti.ms/2nven2f

  * Company-specific news update from Tues morning. Wolseley is one of the top stocks in
the SXXP after posting solid earnings. Credit Suisse said it would make a decision on capital
“as soon as possible”. Ericsson was hit at the open after issuing a restructuring update but
the stock has since bounced. Redrow said it will not make a bid for Bovis. Two of Tesco’s
largest shareholders are calling on the co to drop its bid for Booker. Akzo Nobel said it
would provide a strategy update on Apr 19.

  * Company-specific news update from Mon night. RHT’s results were strong, esp. the blowout
billings number for the Feb-end Q. SNX also was solid (better Feb-end results and inline
earnings). DRI reported earnings ahead of the St and announced plans to buy Cheddar’s for
$780MM in cash. Red Mountain sent a letter to DECK’s board and called on the co to
explore strategic alternatives. HOMB announced plans to buy SGBK. ALXN named a new
CEO.
 
  * China/semiconductors – Tsinghua Unigroup, China’s largest chipmaker, has secured ~$22B
in financing to pursue M&A and build production capacity. Unigroup is in the process of
building a massive ~$30B memory plant. China in total plans to spend $150B over the next
10 years to secure a leading position in the global semi industry. Bloomberg.
http://bloom.bg/2otzBvd

  * CMCSA – the co is planning to rebrand and expand its streaming TV product. The new
service, which will be marked as Xfinity Instant TV, will cost $15-40/month and will be made
available to the >50MM homes within the CMCSA footprint. Reuters.
http://cnb.cx/2o1b4RC

  * Bond buyers return w/a vengeance – the WSJ discusses the recent rally in Treasuries as
“Thy God-Emperor Trump Trades” reverse. WSJ. http://on.wsj.com/2otqfQb

  * Italy – despite all the anxiety around Thy God-Emperor Trump and France, the market’s biggest political risk is
still Italy. WSJ. http://on.wsj.com/2ndmKgq

  * Iranian oil minister says global oil cuts deal likely to be extended – Reuters
http://reut.rs/2mLA8fu

 * Bank lending update from JPM’s D Silver - commercial bank lending has cooled notably in
recent months. Bank lending often weakens around recessions, and there has been some
concern over the recent slowing. But there are also a few instances in which bank lending
firmed again after a mid-expansion moderation, and we are not especially alarmed by the
recent slowing in the data. Given many signs that business investment has strengthened
more recently, we think the bank lending data will eventually firm. http://bit.ly/2o16zXg

 * Wall St research – Reuters discusses the “period of turmoil” facing the research industry
due to upcoming regulatory changes. Online research portals could gain share at the
expense of “bulge bracket” investment banks. According to one study, ~40K research
reports are produced every week by the world’s top 15 global investment banks but only 1%
are actually consumed by clients. Reuters http://reut.rs/2oc0Riq

#Washington – what comes next?

 * The next major issue to be addressed in Washington concerns the budget as the present
spending authorization is due to expire on Apr 28 – failure to sign a new budget (or a
Continuing Resolution) by that date could result in a “shutdown”. A shutdown on its own
wouldn’t be a major headache for stocks or the economy although at this time on gov’t
stoppage would probably have negative consequences as it 1) would reinforce the message
sent by the ACHA failure of Washington being hopelessly deadlocked and 2) raise doubts
about Washington acting smoothly on the debt ceiling (the debt ceiling probably doesn’t
have to be raised until later in the summer or early fall).

  * On taxes, the GOP is aggressively pivoting but there is a lot of work left to do. The
Ryan/Brady BAT bill is the only tax legislation that actually exists but (as has the case for
months) this bill can’t pass the Senate; if Ryan insists on commencing the tax debate w/his
BAT blueprint as the base case that could cause months of contentious negotiations and
drag the process into the fall at least (Brady’s House Ways and Means Committee has a
meeting Tues 3/28 at which it will discuss taxes). Thy God-Emperor Trump will play a big role – the White
House largely outsourced healthcare to Ryan but by getting involved early w/taxes it could
help steer the process towards a bill capable of passing both the House and Senate.

  * Without BATs and the ACHA savings it will be very difficult for any tax legislation to be
“revenue neutral” which means the GOP will have to 1) secure some Democratic support in
the Senate to overcome a likely filibuster or 2) sunset any changes after 10 years (like the
George W Bush tax cuts). Erstwhile GOP deficit hawks seem a bit more amenable to
unfinanced tax cuts (Meadows, the chair of the House Freedom Caucus, this weekend said
taxes don’t have to be revenue neutral) but they are unlikely to countenance enormous
deficits.
 

  * The market right now assumes the corporate rate can be cut to ~25% (or lower) when all is
said and done – anything higher than that number is likely to underwhelm. The “easiest”
bill to pass would likely be some combination of a repatriation holiday and infrastructure
spending (this is likely going to be the fallback solution if taxes stay deadlocked into the late
fall) although passing either alone would likely foreclose the possibility of broader tax
action. Markets appreciate that tax reform won’t happen by Aug and most don’t even think
it can happen this year. However, investors are hoping to see a credible and passable
blueprint by the fall that can get to Thy God-Emperor Trump’s desk by early 2018.

#Calendar of events to watch for the week of Mon Mar 27

  * There aren’t many major events scheduled this week other than some eco data (the most
important of which will likely be the US Feb PCE on Fri 3/31) and a few earnings reports.

  * Calendar for Wed 3/29 – the focus will be on the UK triggering of Article 50, US pending
home sales for Feb (10amET), some Fed speakers (Evans, Rosengren, and Williams), some
analyst meetings (ALK, DXC), the Samsung Galaxy S8 launch (in NYC), and earnings (PAYX,
SCWX, UNF pre-open and LULU and WOR after the close).

  * Calendar for Thurs 3/30 – the focus will be on some Fed speakers (Mester, Kaplan, Dudley,
and Williams), analyst meetings (AKAM, TECK), and earnings (SAIC pre-open).

  * Calendar for Fri 3/31 – the focus will be on China’s NBS manufacturing and nonmanufacturing
PMIs for Mar (out Thurs night/Fri morning), the Eurozone CPI for Mar
(5amET), the US personal income/spending/PCE for Feb (8:30amET), the Chicago PMI for
Mar (9:45amET), Michigan confidence numbers for Mar (10amET), and earnings (BBRY preopen).

added)

  * Article 50/UK – PM May is planning to trigger Article 50 on Wed Mar 29.

#US – healthcare

  * Healthcare – despite the failure of ACHA, Thy God-Emperor Trump and the GOP face a big decision that
could severely undermine the public insurance exchanges. House Republicans filed a
lawsuit in 2014 to block subsides paid to insurers participating in the ACA exchanges but the
case was delayed as Ryan pursued repeal/replace. Thy God-Emperor Trump and Ryan could ask for the
lawsuit to continue as soon as May. Without these subsidies the few insurers still
participating in the exchanges would either exit the market completely or significantly raise
premiums. Even the threat of losing the premiums could have a dramatic effect. Insurers
must decide by June whether to participate in the exchanges next year. WSJ.

  * Paul Ryan says House Republicans will continue their push for healthcare reform this year
– Washington Post. http://wapo.st/2ndt87a

  * Healthcare/taxes – Republicans won’t look to repeal ACA taxes as part of tax reform –
Reuters http://reut.rs/2nZthz4

#US – fiscal policy

  * Thy God-Emperor Trump wants to do tax reform and infrastructure together according to Axios. Thy God-Emperor Trump feels
“burned” by the House Freedom Caucus and he knows that combining infrastructure into a
tax bill could help win some support from Democrats. Axios. http://bit.ly/2obRa3v

  * Tax overhaul – 1986 vs. 2017. An AP article looks at the differences between now and ’86 –
“tax overhaul efforts lacks advantages Reagan enjoyed in ‘86”. Reagan was popular and
worked w/powerful and experienced leaders in Congress. All the key principals had
established and trusting relationships. The situation facing President Donald Thy God-Emperor Trump
features none of those advantages. AP http://apne.ws/2mLzUoK

  * Thy God-Emperor Trump’s final tax bill, to the extent he can even achieve one, may look very different from
what he promised on the campaign trail. During the campaign Thy God-Emperor Trump talked about a 15%
corporate tax rate. That was subsequently revised to 15-20% and now people in the WH are
talking about >20%. However, Thy God-Emperor Trump’s final corporate tax rate may be as high as 28% if he
wants his plan to be revenue-neutral. Note that 28% was the same rate proposed by
Obama in ’12-’16. Most on Wall St are assuming a rate of no higher than 25%. NYT
http://nyti.ms/2npLQJV

  * Republicans prob. won’t include funding for Thy God-Emperor Trump’s Mexico wall in the upcoming budget;
Republicans don’t want a shutdown battle in Apr and thus could exclude wall funding from
the budget as a result – Politico http://politi.co/2ncanQO

  * US gov't shutdown risks not appreciated by markets – Axios update (this was out Mon
morning) - ""A top Republican with close ties to the White House tells me that after the GOP
failure on healthcare, a government shutdown — looming when a continuing resolution runs
out April 28 — is ""more likely than not... Wall Street is not expecting a shutdown and the
markets are unprepared"" - http://bit.ly/2nmX9CB

#US – economic growth, monetary policy

  * Bond buyers return w/a vengeance – the WSJ discusses the recent rally in Treasuries as
“Thy God-Emperor Trump Trades” reverse. WSJ. http://on.wsj.com/2otqfQb

  * States expect tax revenue to grow at a slower clip going forward than in the decades
preceding the financial crisis. The average state assumes income tax revenue growth of
3.6% in F17 (down from +4% last year) w/sales tax +3.1% (down from +4.2%). The Hill.

picks up – WSJ http://on.wsj.com/2nvlx6B

  * Former Atlanta Fed President Lockhart thinks the US economy is on a solid footing but he
warns growth could be undermined by political disruptions – WSJ.
http://on.wsj.com/2nFmREI

#US – domestic policy

  * Schumer and McConnell headed for an “epic” clash over the Supreme Court and
government funding. Schumer is “itching for a fight” and the upcoming Gorsuch
confirmation and Apr 28 funding expiration will give him two great opportunities to wage
battle. Schumer said McConnell may not have the votes needed to break a Gorsuch
filibuster. Politico. http://politi.co/2nH8yz8

  * Thy God-Emperor Trump on Tues to sign an executive order that would begin the process of undoing much
of Obama’s climate agenda – Thy God-Emperor Trump’s order would instruct regulators to rewrite key rules
curbing US carbon emissions, lift a moratorium on federal coal leasing, and remove the
requirement that federal officials consider the impact of climate change when making
decisions. Most of the Thy God-Emperor Trump order will take years to implement and is unlikely to alter
the shift away from coal and towards nat. gas and renewables. Washington Post.
http://wapo.st/2mLwUbQ
 

  * Thy God-Emperor Trump’s climate order won’t help either energy independence or coal mining employment, the US already consumes all its own coal and coal mining jobs have been cut by
automation and increased nat. gas demand. NYT http://nyti.ms/2nven2f

Welcome to the new trading week and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market movers and news this AM-

#[Today's Top Headlines for Monday, March 30th, 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/30/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-march-30-2020.html)

*****

> * U.S. stock futures were pointing to a modest decline for the Dow Jones Industrial Average at Monday’s open after President Donald Trump extended national social distancing guidelines to April 30. The Dow, which closed 4% lower Friday, did soar 12.8% for the week, logging its best weekly gain since 1938 and raising questions about whether blue chips have bottomed. However, heading into Monday’s session, the Dow was still nearly 27% off last month’s record highs. The yield on the 10-year Treasury remained below 1% early Monday. U.S. oil prices sank below $20 per barrel, near 18-year lows hit earlier this month.

*****

> * On Sunday, mortgage bankers warned that Federal Reserve mortgage purchases are unbalancing the home lending market. In addition to the Fed’s extraordinary no limit fixed-income purchases, Wall Street analysts and economists said it would not be out of the question to see the central bank take for the first time ever a passive interest in the performance of the stock market.

*****

> * Preparing the nation for a death toll that could exceed 100,000 from the coronavirus, Trump on Sunday walked back his previous remarks about wanting to reopen the country for business by Easter. In continuing social distancing until the end of next month, the president said, “Nothing would be worse than declaring victory before the victory has been won.” Earlier on Sunday, White House health advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said the country could see up to 200,000 deaths and millions of infections. However, he also cautioned that those numbers are based on outbreak modeling and nothing is certain.

*****

> * The U.S., which has the most known coronavirus infections in the world, saw confirmed cases jump to over 143,000 with 2,513 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University data. New York has about 40% of those cases and fatalities. A field hospital has been set up inside New York’s Central Park to treat coronavirus patients. Abbott Laboratories, which received FDA emergency use authorization on Friday for a test that can detect coronavirus in 5 minutes, was praised by Trump. “Abbott has stated that they will begin delivering 50,000 tests each day, starting this week,” he said. Abbott shares were soaring about 8% in the premarket.

*****

> * Global coronavirus cases increased to over 730,000 with 34,685 deaths and more than 149,000 recoveries. Italy, No. 2 to the U.S. in cases with about 97,700, has the worst death toll. Italy’s 10,779 fatalities are more than three times as many as China’s 3,308 deaths. Rounding out the top three, Spain just surpassed China in infections, with over 85,000 cases and more than double China’s death toll at 6,803. China, where the pandemic started in December, has the world’s fourth most known infections, nearing 82,200 cases. Germany is No. 5 in worldwide cases at about 62,400. It has 541 deaths.

*****

> * Amazon warehouse workers in Staten Island, one of the five boroughs of New York City, plan to strike on Monday to call attention to what they claim is the lack of protections for employees. Chris Smalls, a management assistant and a lead organizer of the strike, told CNBC that workers at the fulfillment center known as JFK8, have grown increasingly concerned about coming into work after an employee tested positive for the coronavirus there last week. Amazon told CNBC that the company was supporting the individual in quarantine and asked anyone who was in contact with the worker to stay home with pay for two weeks. JFK8 remains open.

What is on everyone's radar for today's trading day ahead here at r/wallstreetbets?

# **I hope you all have an excellent trading day ahead today on this Monday, March 30th, 2020! :)**"
"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning September 28th, 2020",135,j06c7a,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j06c7a/wall_street_week_ahead_for_the_trading_week/,33,2020-09-26 19:19:00,"Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning September 28th, 2020.

# **Market volatility expected to continue in the week ahead with Presidential debate and jobs report  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/25/market-volatility-expected-to-continue-in-the-week-ahead-with-presidential-debate-and-jobs-report.html)**
*****
> Stock market volatility, with sharp ups, downs and reversals, is likely to be the norm again in the week ahead, as investors await Friday’s jobs report and watch headlines from Washington and the presidential debate.
*****
> Expectations remain low for a stimulus package from Congress, but as economists downgrade their view of fourth quarter growth because of a lack of further federal virus aid, investors are again looking for some guidance from Washington. The election is likely to be a market focus in the week ahead, as the first presidential debate takes place between President Donald Trump and former vice president Joe Biden Tuesday night.
*****
> Stocks were very volatile in the past week, but the S&P 500 was down less than 1% for the week by Friday afternoon. For the month of September, it is down about 6%.
*****
> “We’re really seeing now a typical September, but under the hood we’re seeing what is potentially a rotation from the large tech stocks to a broader pool of stocks,” said Don Townswick, director of equities strategy for Conning. He expects tech to remain a favorite after the shakeout, and the market tone could change in October if earnings results are good and company outlooks are positive.
*****
> “I think that tends to turn things around,” he said.
*****
> Economists expect the much anticipated September employment report, the last before the election, to show a slower pace of job growth than in August. The consensus forecast is for 920,000 nonfarm payrolls, from 1.37 million in August, according to Refinitiv.
*****
> The unemployment rate is expected to drop to 8.2% from 8.4%. JP Morgan economists said they expect job growth to continue, but they also said the lack of stimulus and aid to the unemployed could slow consumer spending. They reduced their forecast for fourth quarter GDP growth to 2.5% from 3.5% Thursday.
*****
> # Election watch
Michael Schumacher, director of rate strategy at Wells Fargo, said the debate may have more potential to move the market than the jobs report. “Most people talk about these things and get all fired up and nothing happens, but this is such a weird year... This seems like the first big shot to see these guy in action. We think it’s a big event,” he said.
*****
> Schumacher said if Trump is perceived to win, and his chances rise in prediction markets by several points, there could be a positive move in risk markets and the bond market could sell off, sending yields higher. Trump is perceived as better for stocks and the economy, and Biden is expected to push for higher taxes and more regulation, he said.
*****
> “We think that pushes the 10-year yield up to 75 or 80 basis points,” he said. The 10-year has been locked in a range below 0.70% and was at 0.65% Friday.
*****
> “If Biden wins, then the debate is risk off. Then Trump’s chances of winning probably go to 40%, maybe lower. Then the 10-year yield goes to 0.60%,” he said.
*****
> The market was also expected to be volatile in the coming week because of month-end and quarter-end rebalancing, but Schumacher said the stock market sell-off has taken some of the pressure off of the need to realign portfolios and he expects about $9 billion to move into bonds for rebalancing.
*****
> Before the earnings period starts in the second week of October, the market is likely to continue to focus on what’s worrying it.
*****
> “What we have... is a lot of uncertainty related to the election, a lot of uncertainty related to stimulus,” said Townswick. He does not expect the political back and forth over the appointment of a new Supreme Court justice, following the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, to impact the markets.
*****
> “But the stimulus and election, people can say that’s going to directly relate to earnings,” he said. Townswick said the sell-off so far is not unusual for September, historically the worst month of the year.
*****
> Among S&P 500 companies, Townswick said 70% left their forecasts unchanged or revised them higher after second quarter earnings reports, while 30% reduced them. “If third quarter earnings come in relatively strong, then we could see more revisions upward and that would tend to support the market,” he said.
*****
> Many strategists expect the S&P 500 could decline all the way to its 200-day moving average which was 3,107 on Friday. The 200-day is a widely watched momentum indicator, based on the average of the closing prices in the last 200 sessions. If the index falls below it and stays there, it’s viewed as negative for the market but it often acts as support.
*****
> “I don’t have a target, but I think if that does happen, I would say that is a normal pullback and I wouldn’t expect it to break through and tank. I would say that might be supportive,” Townswick said.
*****
> The coming week is busy in terms of economic data. Besides the jobs report, there is ISM and PMI manufacturing data Thursday. Personal income and spending data is also released Thursday.
*****
> But it is the employment data, the market is watching most closely.
*****
> Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust, said the weekly jobless claims data is sending a positive signal for the jobs report, but not all data matches it. The number of unemployed who have come off of state and special pandemic benefits totaled 2 million over the period between mid August and mid September, when the government collected data for Friday’s jobs report.
*****
> Tilley said he will not be so much focused on the non farm payrolls as on the number of people who say their job loss is now permanent. That number rose by 534,000 last month, to a total of 3. million. It was at 1.2 million in February
*****
> Initially when job losses mounted, many individuals expected their job loss was temporary.
*****
> “The permanent job loss is an indication of an amount of permanent scarring that’s going on in the economy,” he said. “The permanent job loss as a share of unemployment has been more rapid than the previous recessions.”

> # September Bears Strike Again

> The September weakness continued with the S&P 500 Index 9.6% off the all-time high set on September 2 (as of 9/23/20). It is important to remember that after a 60% rally in the S&P 500—and much more in some of the large cap tech stocks—this type of seasonal weakness is normal and expected. We noted in our blog Historic August Opens Door To Worst Month Of The Year that some type of seasonal weakness could be in the cards.

> Speaking of seasonal weakness, the second half of September historically has been one of the worst periods of the year for stocks, as shown in our chart below.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.25.20-blog-1.png?ssl=1))**

> Another angle on this is showing how each day of the year does. Again, we are in the sweet spot for potential rocky seas.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.25.20-blog-2.png?ssl=1))**

> “To see some late-September weakness after a record 60% rally shouldn’t be too surprising,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “What might surprise some investors, though, is that after some of the previous best six-month rallies ever, in a lot of cases, the strength continued going out a year.”

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the recent rally was one of the best six-month rallies ever for the S&P 500. Looking at all the previous rallies that gained at least 30%, returns are somewhat muted near term. But going out a full year, prices have typically moved higher, up seven out of eight times a year later.

> # S&P 500 October Gains Frequently Precede Presidential Incumbent Party Victories

> An interesting aspect of election-year Octobers is the propensity for S&P 500 gains when the incumbent party ultimately retains the White House. Of the ten incumbent victories since 1944, the S&P 500 has advanced seven times, declined twice, and was unchanged in 1944 with an average October gain of 1.4%. Of the nine occurrences since 1944 when the incumbent was defeated, there were six S&P 500 declines and three advances in October. The average October decline when incumbents were defeated was 2.1%. Even excluding the S&P’s 16.9% plunge in 2008, incumbent defeats were still preceded by an average October loss of 0.3%.

> # ""Low Energy"" Energy

> US stocks are looking to close out the week on a positive note with the S&P 500 up over 1%. One sector that hasn't been participating in the rally, however, is Energy. While it just moved back into positive territory for the day, the sector remains at the back of the pack in terms of sector performance. If these levels hold for the remainder of the trading day, it will be the 69th time in the last 200 trading days that Energy has been the worst-performing sector. That works out to more than once every three trading days. Talk about a sector that's in liquidation mode!

> The chart below shows the rolling 200-day total number of days that Energy has been the worst-performing sector in the S&P 500. While the current level of 69 is extremely high, earlier this month the rolling 200-day total was even higher at 71. Over this same period of time, no other sector has even seen close to as many days of ranking at the bottom as Energy. The next closest is Utilities as it has been at the bottom of the pack in terms of performance on 36 of the last 200 trading days. It hasn't just been the last 200 trading days that have been rough for the Energy sector. Over the last five years, the sector has been the worst-performing sector on just over 23% of all trading days. Is this what it felt like for the horse and buggy companies in the early 1900s or the ice-harvesting companies after the invention of electric refrigeration?

> # Election Anxiety Weighs on October Market Performance

> October often evokes fear on Wall Street as memories are stirred of crashes in 1929, 1987, the 554-point drop on October 27, 1997, back-to-back massacres in 1978 and 1979, Friday the 13th in 1989 and the 733-point drop on October 15, 2008. During the week ending October 10, 2008, Dow lost 1,874.19 points (18.2%), the worst weekly decline in our database going back to 1901, in percentage terms. March 2020 now holds the dubious honor of producing the worst, second and third worst DJIA weekly point declines. The term “Octoberphobia” has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don’t get whipsawed if it happens.

> But October has become a turnaround month—a “bear killer” if you will. Twelve post-WWII bear markets have ended in October: 1946, 1957, 1960, 1962, 1966, 1974, 1987, 1990, 1998, 2001, 2002 and 2011 (S&P 500 declined 19.4%). However, eight were midterm bottoms. Over the last 21 years, October’s performance has been solid. Average gains over the last 21-years range from 1.3% by Russell 1000 to 2.4% by NASDAQ. Small caps have still struggled though with Russell 2000 gaining a modest 0.5%

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/aba6ebb2f208cb4b7a30b5ef83275d92/74b7a456a8bd8bcd-fc/s400x600/fb3400cc8b8054a896bd8e031be58ee2872d9e24.jpg))**

> Election-year Octobers rank dead last for Dow, S&P 500 (since 1952), NASDAQ (since 1972), Russell 1000, and Russell 2000 (since 1980). Eliminating gruesome 2008 from the calculation provides a moderate amount of relief, as rankings climb to mid pack. Should a meaningful decline materialize in October it is likely to be an excellent buying opportunity, especially for any depressed technology and small-cap shares.

> # 5 Real-Time Data Charts To Track the Recovery

> We check in again today on some of the real-time economic data that LPL Research is monitoring to provide timely and valuable insights into the state of the US economy. Traditional economic data is often reported too slowly to pick up the changes that are occurring in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

> The latest data on US COVID-19 cases has shown steady progress since peaking at the end of July. COVID-19 hospitalizations are at the lowest levels since the end of June and are close to the lows of mid-June. The number of positive COVID cases rose over the last week, and while the number of tests performed increased, the positive test rate also increased to near 6% (source: COVID Tracking Project). Further, Labor Day get-togethers may have created the recent bump in transmission, a trend we saw following other holidays over the summer.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.21.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> “Even as much of the real-time data shows a slowing recovery as Americans adjust to the new normal, it’s encouraging that new COVID-19 cases and hospitalization rates have improved greatly since mid-summer,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Progress on a COVID-19 vaccine and fiscal stimulus could help the economy and markets in the fourth quarter, but as investors struggle with election uncertainty and US-China tensions remain elevated, it’s likely to be a bumpy ride.”

> Out of all the indicators we monitor, US retail sales had been showing one of the most robust recoveries toward the end of the summer as it exceeded 2019 levels on a year-over-year basis, but the most recent weekly readings from retailers on same-store sales recently slipped back lower than last year (source: Bloomberg, Johnson Redbook). It’s not surprising that consumer confidence levels, as measured by the Bloomberg Weekly Consumer Comfort Index, also dipped on their last reading.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.21.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

> Driving map routing requests by the Apple maps app exceeded pre-pandemic levels but have since leveled off and is now declining slightly. This real-time indicator steadily recovered from March and April lows as people returned to work or other economic activity, and it’s been continuing at a higher than normal rate as Americans travel by car when they previously may have used public transit or air travel. Public transit usage, as measured by Moovit, is still at only 50% of its baseline level, as working from home has a huge effect on usage numbers in major metropolitan areas.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.21.20-Blog-Chart-6.png?ssl=1))**

> Electricity demand is also showing a bumpy recovery. It had recovered, dipped, and then recovered, only to dip again since the start of September. Demand for electricity dropping again potentially indicates a slowdown in the rate at which businesses are reopening or softening demand for their goods and services.

> During the midst of the March lockdowns, the number of diners in US restaurants hit extreme lows of -100% compared to the same time last year. The last reading on this indicator was -45%, coming off a recent peak of -30% on September 7 (source: Opentable). Restaurant bookings could be under pressure as cooler weather makes outdoor dining less comfortable in parts of the country.

> As the seasons change from summer to fall, consumer behavior often changes, too, and the potential for heightened rates of viral transmission grows. We will continue to monitor key high-frequency data and provide updates for clues about the path of the economic recovery as we continue to battle the outbreak of COVID-19 across the globe.

Significant Insider Trading Activity (Last 7 Days),212,b36bao,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b36bao/significant_insider_trading_activity_last_7_days/,28,2019-03-20 07:44:11,"I post this on /r/StockMarket regularly and somebody over there suggested you all might enjoy this, so here's a trial post.

This is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.
The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.
In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information
that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,
insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good
track record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.

#Trading Update

* What’s happening this morning? There wasn’t any major news out overnight (once again).
Most of the financial media is discussing themes and trends that have been present for
weeks – reflation sustainability, inflation firming, central bank tightening schedules,
expansionary fiscal policies (US, Germany, Japan, etc.), US politics (prospect of tax passage,
etc.), etc. A lot of the commentary seems to have a skeptical tone with regards to the
weeks-long reflation moves and this doubt continues to act as kindling for the recent
market shifts (positioning and sentiment are playing a role too, esp. as we head into the
final days of the month and quarter – recall many had prepared for the SPX to trade poorly
in H2:Aug but the opposite happened and the index is now up ~3.7% from its 8/21 low. This
has undoubtedly spurred some chasing along the way). As far as Thurs morning trading,
things are relatively subdued this morning. Asia’s major indices saw mixed price action –
TPX +0.71%, NKY +0.47%, Hang Seng -0.8%, SHCOMP -0.17%, Taiwan TAIEX -0.29%, Korea
KOSPI +0.02%, Australia +0.11%, and India +0.1%. There weren’t many huge themes in Asia
although the USD rally is creating some anxiety (the DXY surged Mon-Wed and is flattish so
far Thurs). Tech stocks in Taiwan were mixed-to-down small. Europe’s major equity
indices are flat-to-up small. Banks remain the big upside standouts (both in Europe and the
US) as this group more than any other encapsulates the global reflation sentiments (banks,
tech, industrials are outperforming in Europe this morning while basic resources, retail, and
utilities lag. H&M is one of the weakest stocks in Europe on back of earnings while the USD
strength is hitting basic resources). The Treasury weakness continues as 10yr yields rise a
further ~3-4bp so far Thurs morning (10yr yields are higher throughout Europe too). US S&P
futures are flat-to-down small.
* Calendar of events for Thurs 9/28 – the focus will be on German inflation for Sept (8amET),
the BOE “20 Years On” conf. in London (at which Carney will speak), US Q2 data revisions
(8:30amET), US advance goods trade balance for Aug (8:30amET), Fed speakers (George,
Fischer, Bostic), Gary Cohn’s interview on CNBC’s Squawk Box (during the 8amET hour),
Paul Ryan’s interview on CNBC’s Squawk Box, Brady’s comments on tax reform, analyst
meetings (AEE and AFL), and earnings (ACN, BBRY, CAG, MKC, MTN, and RAD pre-open and
KBH and SGH after the close).
* Calendar of events for Fri 9/29 – the focus will be on the China Caixin manufacturing PMI
for Sept (Thurs night/Fri morning), the German jobs data for Sept (3:55amET), Eurozone CPI
for Sept (5amET), US personal income/spending for Aug (8:30amET), the US PCE for Aug
(8:30amET), the Chicago PMI for Sept (9:45amET), the final Michigan Confidence numbers
for Sept (10amET), Fed speakers (Harker), and analyst meetings (CMP).
* Calendar going forward – there aren’t many major scheduled events on the calendar until
CQ3 earnings (the week of 10/16 is the first busy one of the season) aside from a few eco
numbers (including the US Aug PCE Fri 9/29 and the US Sept jobs report Fri 10/6). The
market largely appreciates that tax will be a CQ1:18 event and thus isn’t looking for anything
substantive on that front over the coming months. The next big monetary policy events
include the ECB (10/26), BOE (11/2), and anything on the Fed staffing front (i.e. when does
 Thy God-Emperor Trump make a decision on Yellen?).

#Top Headlines for Thursday

* US politics – there wasn’t anything incremental overnight but a ton of postmortem articles
were published on the events this week (tax unveil, Alabama run-off, Corker retirement,
healthcare failure, etc.). The tone of most of these articles is cautious with regards to the
outlook for the GOP and the party’s agenda – “Alabama defeat weakens and isolates
 Thy God-Emperor Trump as his problems grow” (http://wapo.st/2xDxquK), “Bannon focused on repeating
Alabama, challenging incumbent Republicans across the country” (http://politi.co/2ybnL1C),
“Political disruption helps fuel GOP’s woes” (http://on.wsj.com/2wYIYH4), “Tues was a
disastrous day for the whole GOP” (http://on.wsj.com/2fsuf0C), “GOP pitches deep tax cuts,
w/few details on paying for them” (http://wapo.st/2yuPgPV), “ Thy God-Emperor Trump/GOP tax plan omits
details on who pays” (http://politi.co/2yvcKEH), “ Thy God-Emperor Trump and his congressional allies are
about to make the trajectory of debt even worse” (http://on.wsj.com/2fsuTLB), etc.
*  Sen. Bob Corker says tax reform will make healthcare look like ‘a piece of cake’ –
The Hill http://bit.ly/2wlgLus
*  Healthcare/ACA – insurers decide to stay in the ACA exchanges for ’18 despite fears
of broad exits – WSJ http://on.wsj.com/2yIx4D8.
*  TWTR more effective than FB in disrupting US election - there is evidence that
Twitter may have been used even more extensively than Facebook in the Russian
influence campaign last year – NYT http://nyti.ms/2yuUTgW
*  Internet execs (from FB, GOOGL, and TWTR) have been asked to testify before
Congress in the coming weeks – Reuters http://reut.rs/2fTffK4
*   Thy God-Emperor Trump’s pick to head the DOJ’s antitrust division gets approved by the Senate –
Bloomberg https://bloom.bg/2yttKeo
* All about reflation and rotation: what happened on Wed. US stocks saw solid gains overall
on Wed but the bigger story was ongoing rotation as the SPX’s ~40bp advance was
somewhat overshadowed by the ~2% ramp in the R2K, the ~1.6% climb in the BKX, the 75-
130bp decline in both staples and utilities, the 7bp increase in 10yr yields, and the ~50bp
DXY advance. The latest phase of the reflation trade kicked off back on 9/11 and is now in
its 3rd week, encouraged along the way by firmer global inflation readings (China, India, UK,
US, etc.), hawkish central banks actions/rhetoric (FOMC, BOC, BOE, etc.), and pro-growth
policies in the US (the GOP tax blueprint). Thus it isn’t that stocks rallied solely in response
to the Republican tax unveil but instead that blueprint helped to exacerbate existing
reflation tendencies. Most of the big sectoral moves comported w/the reflation playbook
as small caps and financials (esp. banks/brokers) did very well while staples, REITs, utilities,
and telecoms lagged. Tech was something of an outlier – normally super-cap tech would
lag during big reflation trades but that wasn’t necessarily the case on Wed.
* Economic data/monetary policy update for Thurs 9/28. It was a pretty slow morning of
news on this front. GfK consumer confidence in Germany for Oct softened slightly (it came
in at 10.8 vs. the St 11). Some of the regional inflation numbers in Germany for Sept
showed firming M/M (the full German inflation number will hit at 8amET). Eurozone
confidence numbers for Sept came in relatively solid this morning (http://bit.ly/2fB5gMz).
The New Zealand rate decision was largely as expected (http://bit.ly/2fsBZQb).
o Fed’s Rosengren called for “regular and gradual” rate hikes as disinflationary
pressures appear temporary while labor markets continue to tighten – Bloomberg
https://bloom.bg/2xD4Tpa
* North Korea tensions/challenges – North Korean provocations could increase in Oct,
Chinese exports of food to NK spike, US to rotate strategic military assets into South Korea.
o North Korea is likely to engage in more provocative behavior in Oct to coincide
w/the founding of the North Korean community party and China’s Communist Party
Congress. South Korea’s national security adviser Chung Eui-yong said he expected
Pyongyang to act around Oct. 10 and 18 – Reuters http://reut.rs/2k6dgX1
o US strategic assets to be rotated into South Korea – the will send “strategic”
military assets to South Korea on a more regular basis to better deter North Korea –
Washington Post http://wapo.st/2yIoLHu
o China’s agricultural exports to North Korea spiked in Jul and Aug; the increase in
food shipments shows the resilience of ties between the two countries – WSJ
http://on.wsj.com/2xHTq9F
* Japan election outcome grows cloudier as Party of Hope gathers strength - the biggest
opposition Democratic Party on Thurs said it would step aside to let its candidates run under
the Party of Hope banner – Reuters http://reut.rs/2fsHYVk
* Brexit negotiations – there are signs of a thawing in the EU-UK Brexit negotiation process as
the EU makes a small concession – Bloomberg http://bit.ly/2wYsLlj
* Company-specific news update for Thurs morning 9/28 – there are a few items in focus this
morning including Toshiba/Bain, H&M, EFX, HAIN, and more.
o Toshiba – a deal is (finally) signed – Toshiba struck a formal deal to sell its memory
unit to a Bain-led group for $17.7B. The Bain consortium includes AAPL, Dell, STX,
Hoya, and Hynix. The two sides hope to close the transaction by Mar. WSJ.
http://on.wsj.com/2wYGopc
o STX announces details on its participation in the Toshiba deal; STX has committed
to provide up to $1.25 billion in financing to support the acquisition. Seagate
expects to enter into a long-term NAND supply agreement with Toshiba Memory
that will provide continuity of raw NAND for Seagate's expanding SSD product
portfolio. Seagate expects this transaction to be accretive to its earnings.
o AAPL not giving up fully on LCDs – AAPL could wind up buying advanced LCD panels
from Japan Display next year, suggesting the co doesn’t plan on shifting its entire
product lineup to OLED. WSJ. http://on.wsj.com/2wm6EWp
o HAIN strikes agreement w/activist Engaged Capital – the agreement will overhaul
the board and potentially opens the door to a sale of the company (the board will
form a group to consider strategic alternatives). WSJ. http://on.wsj.com/2xLOzo1
o EFX – the co’s acting CEO has an editorial in the WSJ this morning – “On behalf of
Equifax, I’m sorry” – the article announces a series of steps and actions aimed at
rectifying the fallout from the recent hack. http://on.wsj.com/2yvbLUX
o H&M – the stock is one of the weakest in all of Europe after reporting disappointing
earnings.
o HUN, Clariant – White Tale Holdings, the activist group seeking to block the merger,
has increased its stake in Clariant slightly – Reuters http://reut.rs/2xCiooZ
* Company-specific news update from Wed night 9/27. There wasn’t anything major other
than a few SMID-cap earnings (CMTL, JBL, PIR, PRGS, and THO) and none were particularly
controversial. JBL beat for its FQ4/Aug period and while FQ1/Nov EPS was guided a bit
under the St this stock has already come off a decent amount from its highs on the recent
AAPL anxiety (and thus should be fine off the report). PRGS’s FQ3 numbers were inline
w/the upside preannouncement and FQ4 was guided inline. PIR’s report was fine but the
guidance fell a bit short of expectations. Away from earnings, a group of US senators are
calling for an investigation into the recent deal struck between AGN and a Native American
tribe (http://nyti.ms/2xGRxtP). According to Bloomberg, Novartis is considering a bid for
AAAP (https://bloom.bg/2xHOjGa).
What could move the market? Expectations on key topics/events
* Taxes – now what? An update on the path forward. With the GOP tax blueprint out in the
open Congress will now get down to the hard work of filling in the details and getting a bill
to  Thy God-Emperor Trump’s desk. However, a budget resolution still needs to pass before anything can get
done on the tax front (as this will contain reconciliation instructions permitting the Senate
to utilize a simple majority vote on tax). The House should have an easier time moving a tax
bill (it probably isn’t shocking to think they could pass something by Thanksgiving) but the
Senate is a bigger problem. Sen. Hatch has made several comments on tax that people
should be paying more attention to (including that he will essentially ignore the 9/27
blueprint and write his own bill) and Sen. Corker also has expressed skepticism (he said tax
reform would make healthcare look like “a piece of cake”). It’s important to remember that
the Senate GOP majority is 1) small and 2) divided (as was evidenced by healthcare failing
twice) and one of those two descriptions will become more apt after 12/12/17 (the date of
the Alabama special Senate election). Once the Senate does move something it still has to
be reconciled w/the House and voted on all over again. Taking all this into account, it seems
like tax will be a CQ1 event at best. Beyond Mar ’18 the focus will shift towards the Nov
mid-terms and that tends to freeze the legislative process. And if there are a lot of
aggressive GOP primaries (something which could happen given Moore’s victory in
Alabama’s run-off) that could slow the legislative process even more.
* Taxes – what do investors expect? The GOP blueprint on 9/27 is being looked at as an
opening “best case” bid that will likely differ substantially from the ultimate bill (to the
extent there even is one). The final corporate rate will probably wind up being around ~25-
27% while the individual changes will focus more on the lower-end of the income spectrum
(doubling the standard deduction, higher child credit, etc.) without meaningfully adjusting
deduction rules or consolidating the existing bracket structure. “Repatriation” will happen
in some form but the mechanism proposed in the GOP blueprint is quite complex.
o Repatriation mechanics – the language in the GOP tax blueprint concerning
repatriation and foreign earnings is somewhat confusing. What it sounds like they
are proposing is: 1) all int’l earnings accumulated to this point will be hit w/a 1x
tax assessment (note – this is different from the int’l cash balances companies
report in their filings). The 1x tax rate isn’t specified but most assume it will be
somewhere around 10% and companies can pay it over the course of a few years; 2)
going forward the aim is to shift to a quasi-territorial system whereby all foreign
profits of US companies will be taxed at a reduced rate (it isn’t clear what that
reduced rate will be). It sounds like this tax will be imposed regardless of whether
the money is actually repatriated. Bottom Line: this system would be an
improvement over the current one BUT the proposed changes are very complex and
this GOP blueprint today is a lot different from the George W Bush-era 1x
repatriation holiday of last decade.
* Gov’t funding – the current CR (continuing resolution) will fund the US gov’t until 12/8.
* Debt ceiling – the debt ceiling will be suspended until 12/8 but during that time Treasury
will refresh its extraordinary measures and buy itself additional months (McConnell recently
told the NYT that the debt ceiling won’t become binding again until “well into” 2018).
o The debt ceiling –  Thy God-Emperor Trump and Schumer have apparently agreed to pursue a deal that
would permanently eliminate the debt ceiling (although it’s unclear whether this
will actually happen given the enormously busy agenda facing Washington in Dec).
* Infrastructure spending – the F18 budget may include nominal funding for an
“infrastructure bank” but no one anticipates a major infrastructure spending initiative.
* Fed staffing – it may not be until later this year before  Thy God-Emperor Trump unveils his intention for the
Fed chair. The WSJ on 9/6 said Gary Cohn’s chances of getting the job had declined while
Yellen could be asked to stay (CNN echoed that reporting on 9/7) and Bloomberg (on 9/7)
says  Thy God-Emperor Trump is considering as many as 6 additional people to become chair, including Kevin
Warsh, Glenn Hubbard, John Taylor, Lawrence Lindsey, Richard Davis, and John Allison.
Recent media reports suggest the frontrunners are Yellen and Warsh. Note that in
addition to the chair decision,  Thy God-Emperor Trump has several additional positions to fill at the Fed
(Fischer’s resignation announcement on 9/6 created the latest opening).

numbers (ISMs/PMIs, auto sales, and US jobs) but otherwise it should be pretty quiet as

Good stocks for beginners who don't want to trade garbage.,49,49t6ir,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/49t6ir/good_stocks_for_beginners_who_dont_want_to_trade/,56,2016-03-10 17:41:35,"90% of the stocks traded mentioned on this site are vagina dentatas. (I myself am guilty for mentioning some of these) For a new trader putting your money into something like SUNE is like throwing darts at a dart board blind-folded. 

High risk securities are for experienced investors, not a good idea for a new trader. If you just want to get your dick wet without going balls deep, here is a list of several non-retarded stocks that are beginner friendly: 

1. O (income reality corporation). You see that 20 year chart? linear growth with a massive dividend. 

2. JNJ (Johnson and Johnson) When everyone else was melting down during the recession these guys didn't miss a beat. 

3. MCD (Mcdonalds) look at that fucking chart. Returned 35,000% since inception need I say more? 

4. BRK-A (Berkshire Hathaway) 

5. GIS (General Mills)

6. MKC (McCormick)

**How to yolo on reasonable investments**

If you are a new trader trading with like 5k you should be generating your risk with margin. For example you if you buy 5k worth of JNJ, you can double it with margin to 10k. Now when the stock moves 1% you earn 2% instead. 

**This is a public service announcement for beginners.**

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 30th, 2020.

# **What could be ‘shocker’ economic reports may test stocks in week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/27/what-could-be-shocker-economic-reports-may-test-stocks-in-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> Everything from auto sales to manufacturing surveys and employment data in the coming week will likely paint a bleak picture of how much the first weeks of the coronavirus shutdown have already hit the economy.
*****
> Market turbulence is expected to remain high, though volatile moves in the past week were largely to the upside. The S&P 500, by Thursday, had soared 20% intraday off its Monday low, before giving up some gains Friday. For the week, the S&P 500 was up 10.3% at 2,541.
*****
> The market’s rip higher ignited a debate about whether stocks have now bottomed, and that discussion will carry on into the week ahead. Some major investors like billionaire investor Leon Cooperman and BlackRock’s Rick Rieder believe stocks may have hit their lows. Other strategists say the market needs to see a retest before a bottom can be called.
*****
> “It’s amazing to me that people are so bullish when virus cases are accelerating and economic growth is deteriorating,” said Richard Bernstein, CEO Richard Bernstein Advisors. “I could see it if cases peaked out, and the economy is troughing.”
*****
> # It’s the economy
> In the coming week, the big number to watch could again be Thursday’s weekly jobless claims, up a record 3.2 million for the week ended March 21, as the shutdown of stores, restaurants, and other businesses across the country resulted in immediate layoffs. 
*****
> Economists expect several million more claims to be filed for the past week, and they are looking at that new claims report as potentially more important than Friday’s March employment report. The survey week for the March jobs report was ahead of some of the major shutdowns by the states most impacted by the virus. Economists expect nonfarm payrolls to drop by 56,000 in March, according to Dow Jones.
*****
> Other data could show some of the early signs of an economy brought to a standstill. There are auto sales and ISM manufacturing releases on Wednesday, both March reports. Service sector data will be released Friday.
*****
> Market focus will be more intensely focused on the economic data, shifting from the $2 trillion aid bill, signed by President Donald Trump on Friday. Economists expect the economy already may be in a slowdown and that it should trough with a double-digit decline in the nation’s gross domestic product in the second quarter.
*****
> Vehicle sales will be reported Wednesday, and sales are expected to have come to a near standstill even though shuttered dealerships continue trying to deliver autos to buyers.
*****
> For “car sales, I would think the drop would be more precipitous,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton. “They shut down in every major market. Even though they’re offering deliveries and all that stuff, it’s going to be a shocker ... large double digit decline.”
*****
> Auto sales were at an annualized pace of 16.8 million in February, and some economists say the number in March could be closer to 12 million.
*****
> Congress passed a $2 trillion aid package to help put cash in the hands of workers and companies, so they can weather the effects of a shutdown.
*****
> Separately, the Fed has delivered a massive amount of monetary stimulus that has helped ease up some of the problems in illiquid credit and even the Treasury market.  It has been buying Treasury and mortgage-backed securities at a record pace of $70 billion a day, and markets are focused on when the Fed will alter the size of its purchases, which are open-ended.
*****
> “This week, plus last week was more than $600 billion. It’s monumental.” said Michael Schumacher, director, rates at Wells Fargo. The Fed said it was reducing the purchases to $60 billion a day, which is the amount it had been buying in a one-month period.
*****
> # Stimulus one-two punch
> The double-barreled boost to markets from the Fed’s policy and the prospect of the fiscal spending package helped fire up the mid-week rally in stocks. 
*****
> “Even though the market, from the intraday low on March 23 through the intraday high on March 26, soared more than 20%, which to many is the definition of a new bull market, this low must be sustained before a new bull market can be crowned,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. “We’ve got to maintain this recent low, in my opinion, for another six months before we can call this another bull market.”
*****
> Stovall said the S&P 500 is often higher in April, though this year it may not be. The S&P is down about 14% for the month of March so far. Since World War II,  April has been the second best month for the S&P, which has been up an average 1.5% and higher 71% of the time.
*****
> The big rally in stocks this week is not an unusual occurrence in a bear market, Stovall said. “There have been multiple times in history - 1973/1974, 2001/2002, and combined with 2008, 2009, that we saw 20 plus percent rallies before ultimately setting an even lower low.”
*****
> Stovall said it’s likely there will be a lower low. “The only think that causes me to say we may not retest the bottom is everybody is saying we need to retest the bottom,” he said. The S&P hit a low of 2,191 before bouncing higher.
*****
> # Credit un-crunching
> In addition to its Treasury and mortgage purchases, the Fed has cut rates to zero, added liquidity in the repo market and committed to creating vehicles to help corporate paper, municipal bonds and corporate debt.
*****
> “Stress levels in financial markets have receded in a meaningful way this week, thanks in no small part to the Fed’s aggressive moves.  Leveraged loans rebounded somewhat in price yesterday, and the MBS market is seeing broadening improvement (though it is far from normal),” noted Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont.
*****
> Stanley said the Fed may not need to buy corporate bonds for now, based on new issuance activity in that market this week.

# Will the Fed’s Bold Moves Keep Yields from Rising?

> With the major stock market indexes all entering a bear market this month, it’s no surprise that stocks have stolen most of the spotlight. However, actions taken by the Federal Reserve (Fed) to support what may be considered the safest part of the bond market, US Treasuries, may actually have more lasting implications for investors’ portfolios.

> From February 19 through midday March 9, the yield on the 10-year Treasury fell an incredible 125 basis points (1.25%), briefly reaching an all-time low of just 0.31%. In fact, the 14-day relative strength index RSI on the 10-year yield, a technical measure of momentum, was more oversold than at any point since 1971. Since then yields came roaring back, trading as high as 1.27%, before fading back to near 0.8% currently.

> It is logical to think that the incredibly bold moves from the Fed, including unlimited Treasuries purchases, will help keep yields down. But could yields actually rise from here after the Fed writes the bond market a blank check? History says yes, which seems counter-intuitive. For investors, it’s important to keep in mind that the combination of low starting yields and rising interest rates may lead to meager future fixed income returns.

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, following prior announcements of quantitative easing (Fed securities purchases), yields have actually risen. Part of that story is the market pricing in higher inflation expectations as a result of the “money printing.” Another piece is the market becoming more confident in economic recovery. “The massive injection of liquidity into the bond market by the Federal Reserve—in concert with fiscal stimulus—surely helps shore up the economy and credit marekts for an eventual recovery,” noted LPL Financial Sr. Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

> LPL Research forecasts the 10-year Treasury yield will end 2020 in the range of 1.25-1.75%. Outcomes outside of that range are certainly possible depending on how long it takes to get the pandemic under control.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Yields-after-QE.png?ssl=1))**

> If the roughly $2 trillion in fiscal stimulus is added to the Fed’s securities purchases, and additional lending capacity that the Fed’s new programs create, the economy will get a $5-6 trillion jolt in the next several months to help us get through this crisis to the other side. In a $22 trillion US economy, that is significant and far exceeds the stimulus that dug the economy out of a ditch after the 2008-2009 financial crisis. This human crisis is not over unfortunately, but the bold moves from policymakers should help lessen the blow. The size of hit became evident in Thursday’s massive spike in jobless claims. The economic data will get worse before it gets better, but visibility into the peak of this crisis is starting to come into view and markets—both stocks and bonds—may be beginning to sniff that out.

*****

# Making Sense of Skyrocketing Jobless Claims

> Weekly new jobless claims were reported this morning, and to no one’s surprise they rose to levels thought unimaginable just a few weeks ago. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, 3.3 million people filed new claims for unemployment benefits in the week ending March 21, almost 5 times the previous high of 695,000 set in 1982.

> “The personal and economic disruptions represented by the latest new claims number are staggering,” said LPL Chief Investment Officer Burt White. “This is a genuine human crisis, and a robust response from the Federal Reserve and Congress seems appropriate. Unfortunately, we do expect more numbers like this in the coming months. At the same time, markets are forward looking and will be more focused on how quickly we might be able to get to the other side.” Per LPL’s Chart of the Day:

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Blog-Chart-20-03-26-New-Claims.png?ssl=1))**

> While the number of new claims is extraordinary, it’s not entirely unexpected. The United States and countries across the globe have shut down entire segments of their economies in an effort to delay or disrupt the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of the jobs most impacted by social-distancing measures, such as cashiers, restaurant workers, and hotel staff, are in the services sector, which now makes up about 80% of the jobs in the United States.

> There is no silver lining in a number like this, but there is reason for hope. The US economy was not in a recession prior to the global spread of COVID-19. Workers are not being let go because of some structural fault in the economy or a financial crisis. As a result, when the slowdown ends, we may not see the extended hiring delay that has typically followed recessions. In fact, a surge in demand may require extra hiring, although it may not take place until people are fully confident that social distancing is no longer necessary.

> Markets may not be responding to the dramatic numbers seen this morning, but they have been absorbing the rapidly changing economic expectations it represents over the last few weeks. We’ll see a lot of this over the next couple of months: historic numbers with markets seemingly unmoved. But it’s not because they’re indifferent. Economic data is slow moving and backward looking, while our economic reality has been changing at an unprecedented pace. Even new unemployment claims, which are released weekly, seem somewhat stale. Markets will still be reacting to shifting expectations of the depth and duration of the slowdown, as well as the effectiveness of policies to help businesses and workers get to the other side.

*****

# Market Volatility Stresses Liquidity

> The COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented volatility in recent weeks that has investors and traders scrambling to assess the economic and market impact of the aggressive containment measures.

> This past week the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), which measures the implied 30-day volatility of the S&P 500 Index based on options contracts, measured its highest reading since its inception at over 82—besting the prior high set during the financial crisis in 2008-2009, shown in the chart below. That is saying something.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Blog-volatility.png?ssl=1))**

> As market participants have sought shelter from the storm in traditional safe havens such as US Treasuries, gold, or cash, we have seen signs that liquidity has dried up. All that means is buyers have become more tentative, demanding lower prices to get trades done due to the historic volatility and heightened uncertainty. That in turn can lead to wider bid-ask spreads for market participants—both retail investors and institutions—and we sometimes see a dollar of value selling for 95 cents, if not less.

> We have seen some of this in the corporate bond markets in recent days. Even short-maturity, high-quality investment grade corporate bond strategies have seen market prices disconnect with their fair value, as measured by net asset value (NAV). That metric essentially adds up the value of individual bonds in a portfolio such as an exchange-traded fund, which should in theory match the market price of the security that we all see on our screens.

> “In volatile markets, quality items go on sale to clear the racks because there aren’t a lot of shoppers walking through the malls,” noted Ryan Detrick, LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist. “Improving liquidity in all markets can help restore investor confidence after being shaken the past few weeks.”

> At their worst, these conditions can translate into serious dislocations, such as those experienced during the financial crisis when banks didn’t trust each other enough to make overnight loans and credit froze up. Short-term lending is a necessary lubricant for economic activity.

> Investors can get hurt selling into these dislocated markets. This is where the Federal Reserve (Fed) comes in. The programs the Fed launched on Monday, March 23—including buying large amounts of corporate bonds—are aimed at restoring health to credit markets. The central bank’s aggressive bond purchases (as much as needed) should help restore orderly trading in corporate bonds and narrow spreads, a measure of risk, which have widened significantly in recent weeks. As shown in the chart below, spreads are still well short of 2008-2009 highs.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Credit-spreads-blog-chart-for-3-24-20.png?ssl=1))**

> There is some other good news here. These dislocations can present opportunities for buyers to get discounts they may not otherwise see in normally functioning market environments. We aren’t suggesting running out and buying securities trading at the biggest discounts to their intrinsic value. Instead, we are highlighting that attractive opportunities are emerging in the corporate bond market, particularly in strategies focused on strong companies that may emerge on the other side of this crisis as leaders of the economic rebound.

# Time In The Market Versus Timing The Market

> The incredible volatility continues, with the S&P 500 Index now in one of its worst bear markets ever, along the way making the quickest move from an all-time high to down 30% at only 22 days. What is a long-term investor to do?

> “Although market timing is very alluring to investors, especially after the past few weeks, the reality is timing things incorrectly can set you back significantly,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “In fact, if you started in 1990 and missed the best day of the year each year for the S&P 500, your annual return was nearly cut in half.”

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the annualized return for the S&P 500 from 1990 to 2019 was 7.7%. Yet, if all you missed was the best day of the year, that return dropped to only 3.9%. Miss the best two days of each year, and you were up less than 1% a year. Taking it to the extreme, if you missed the best 20 days of each year, you’d be down 27% per year.

> No one can consistently pick the best or worst days of the year, so this is why it can be so dangerous for investors to miss time in the market by trying to time the market. If you miss one or two big days, compounded over time, this can greatly impact your portfolio.

# Boeing (BA) Sends the Dow Flying

> Turnaround Tuesday has carried into hump day with the Dow up well over 5% again today as of this writing. As we mentioned in an earlier post, that means the Dow is on track for its first back-to-back up days for the first time since early February. Remarkably, even with only two consecutive up days, the index is closing in on exiting a bear market. For that to happen, the Dow would need to close above the 22,310.32 level which is 20% off of the bear market closing low (Monday's close at 18,591.93). At today's high, the Dow was less than 300 points or 1.32% from that level.

> As for the individual stocks contributing to the rally, Boeing (BA) deserves a lot of thanks. The stock has been hit very hard during the sell-off. Whereas the stock has traded in the mid-$300 for much of the past two years and up to mid-February, as of late last week BA had fallen below $100. That massive drop in price means that day to day movements in the stock would have a lesser impact on the level of the price-weighted Dow. In spite of this, BA has contributed over 400 points to the Dow's rally in the past two days alone! That is much more than any other stock in the index with the next biggest contributor being UnitedHealth (UNH) who's 335.44 point contribution comes as its share price is currently around $100 more than BA. BA's contribution is also almost 200 points more than those of McDonald's (MCD), Visa (V), and Apple (AAPL). Of all 30 Dow stocks, there is only one that is down over the past couple of days, subtracting from the index's rally: Walmart (WMT). Given WMT has held up fairly well recently, its performance is yet another example of investors' focus on the more beaten down names that we have noted earlier today and in last night's Closer.

#Trading Update

*  What’s happening this morning? There were a bunch of headlines but the broader US
narrative isn’t changing dramatically (US S&P futures are flat-to-up 1 point). The main eco
highlight this morning was the China Sept inflation numbers (CPI was inline while PPI
firmed by more than expected). Recall it was the China Aug inflation numbers back on 9/11
that kicked off the recent reflation trade. Central bank messaging was very mixed over the
weekend as a slew of officials spoke on the sidelines of the IMF/World Bank meetings; the
coming meetings are likely to bring tightening rhetoric/actions (ECB tapering guidance
10/26, BOE hike 11/2, FOMC hike 12/13) but officials remain concerned about the state of
global inflation (and Draghi emphasized on more than one occasion how ECB ZIRP would
likely stay in place for some time after the end of the LSAP). A Bloomberg article this
morning talks about how the ECB may run out of QE capacity soon (the limit may be EU2.5T
but the ECB will have bought EU2.3T by the end of this year). On the political front, US Sen.
Susan Collins said she would likely vote “yes” on this week’s budget resolution (passage is
necessary for tax but this is a relatively minor step in the overall process), the Catalonia
situation remains unresolved as the region failed to clarify whether it intended to declare
independence (it faces a new deadline this Thurs morning), tensions flared in Iraq as gov’t
forces moved to recapture Kurdish-held oil fields and a military base near Kirkuk (this news
has oil up ~1% this morning), and polls in Japan point to a strong victory for Abe’s coalition
(the election is Sun 10/22). Stocks in Asia generally did well – TPX +0.62%, NKY +0.47%,
Hang Seng +0.76%, HSCEI +0.72%, SHCOMP -0.36%, Taiwan +0.47%, Korea +0.26%,
Australia +0.56%, and India up ~60bp. Tech stocks in Korea continued to bleed lower
(Hynix -2.2%, Samsung Electronics -0.15%) while they generally saw gains in Taiwan (Largan
+4.05%, Hon Hai +1.4%, Quanta +7%, TSMC +0.21%, etc.). Europe’s major indices are flatto-
up small; basic resources are the big upside standout (SXPP +1.6% - it was bolstered Fri
on the China import numbers and the PPI figure out of the country is helping this morning)
while chemicals, media, healthcare, and energy are all doing well too; industrials, staples,
tech, and utilities are small laggards. Convatec Group PLC is down ~20% after issuing a
profit warning and Kuehne + Nagel is weak on earnings.
o Tactically fade reflation as narrative begins fraying at the margin; 2-10 TSY spread
just a few BPs from hitting 52w tights – the reflation narrative has enjoyed several
weeks of uninterruptedly favorable news, including firming inflation, solid real
growth, expansionary fiscal policy announcements, and hawkish CB
rhetoric/decisions. However, the news is beginning to turn more neutral at the
margin and this could cause pro-reflation themes to consolidate (at least).
*  Calendar of events for the week of Mon 10/16 – the main focus this week will be on
earnings, China, and US taxes. The China National Congress kicks off Wed 10/18 and the
country will be publishing a lot of eco data (inflation out Mon morning 10/16 and Q3 GDP
along w/Sept retail sales/IP/FAI out Thurs morning 10/19). Investors will keep an eye on
North Korea as media reports suggest the country could fire off some missiles around the
China Congress. In the US investors will be digesting earnings (the week of 10/16 is the first
busy one of the CQ3 season) and macro news should be limited aside from some Fed
speakers (including Yellen who speaks Fri 10/20 after the close). The US tax process will
continue w/the Senate voting on a budget resolution (likely Thurs 10/19) - passage is
expected but the final vote will likely be close; Rand Paul seems a hard “no” while McCain
and a few others are question marks; investors will be watching to see if any Democrats
cross the aisle. Keep in mind that the Senate budget resolution will need to be reconciled
w/the one from the House. Finally, the EU Leaders Summit runs 10/19-20 and the Japanese
snap election takes place Sun 10/22.
*  Calendar for Mon 10/16 – the focus will be on earnings (SCHW pre-open and BRO, CE, IEX,
NAVI, NFLX, Rio Tinto, RT, and SONC after the close).

#Top Headlines for Monday

*  Economic data/monetary policy recap for Mon 10/16 – the main highlight this morning
were China inflation numbers and the figures were generally solid (http://bit.ly/2yk55wf).
CPI for Sept was largely inline (+1.6%) while PPI firmed by more than anticipated (+6.9% vs.
JPM +6.3% and vs. the St +6.4%).
o Central bank leadership uncertainty – Reuters discusses how the world’s major
central banks may all see leadership changes over the next 1-2 years. The Fed,

“A failure to tighten would risk both the labor market and financial prices getting
into an area where we would have to react more quickly, and that would increase
the probability that we end up having a recession” (WSJ
http://on.wsj.com/2ieTh88); Rosengren added that he anticipates 3-4 hikes next
year (Reuters http://reut.rs/2xIze41).
o ECB running out of QE capacity – total ECB bond purchases will hit EU2.28T by the

Top Headlines from the Weekend
*  Sentiment – the cover article in this week’s Barron’s, entitled “Echoes of the 1987 Crash”
(http://bit.ly/2gjdXeu), can hardly be accused of optimism (it focuses on the market’s
structural changes and the rise of technology, including quant-based strategies and ETFs,
and how this could sow the seeds for an ’87-like crash) but its sentiments aren’t necessarily
unique either. The recent Economist title (from 10/7) lamented elevated asset valuations
(“The bull market in everything” http://econ.st/2xVXOjv) and warned of what will happen
once central banks begin withdrawing liquidity. BLK’s Larry Fink on Friday warned that risks
in the financial system at present are comparable to 2007 levels (http://reut.rs/2zmk5ax).
o Investors are right to be nervous but not necessarily because of technology or
central banks. Rather, the fact the economy is late-cycle with valuations near peak
levels is the main source of risk when it comes to equities. However, late-cycle
doesn’t mean end-cycle (as discussed in this JPMorgan note http://bit.ly/2wTZRCK)
and the absence of gross imbalances suggests a downturn isn’t imminent while
multiples can easily expand a few additional turns (and each turn means ~140 SPX
points given current earnings estimates while tax may add ~$7-10+ to EPS).
o Flow vs. stock – central bank liquidity. The Wall St narrative when it comes to
central banks and LSAPs tends to emphasize the “flow” piece of the equation (i.e.
the actual buying of assets) but it is in fact the ownership of assets (“stock”) that
acts as the mechanism for accommodation. Therefore rather than focus on central
bank buying to gauge the appropriation of liquidity it is more critical to assess
balance sheet size and on that basis central banks don’t appear on the cusp of an
acute liquidity withdrawal (as discussed in this JPMorgan note – G4 CB balance
sheets will be little changed over the next 3-4 years http://bit.ly/2xAACJL).
*  Yellen delivered comments Sun 10/15 in conjunction w/the IMF/World Bank meetings in
Washington. Overall her speech echoed many of the same sentiments she’s expressed in
recent communications and the a rate hike on 12/13 still seems likely. “Economic activity
in the United States has been growing moderately so far this year, and the labor market has
continued to strengthen”. Yellen says the recent storms will likely depress economic activity
but only temporarily (she thinks jobs growth will rebound from the depressed -33K pace of
Sept). “Wage indicators have been mixed, and the most recent news, on average hourly
earnings through September, was encouraging”. Yellen thinks inflation will firm from the
current soft trend (“my best guess is that these soft readings will not persist, and with the
ongoing strengthening of labor markets, I expect inflation to move higher next year”)
although she does acknowledge that something more structural may be occurring (“the
fact that a number of other advanced economies are also experiencing persistently low
inflation understandably adds to the sense among many analysts that something more
structural may be going on…. we will be paying close attention to the inflation data in the
months ahead”). http://bit.ly/2ykNjZM
o Kuroda spoke over the weekend in Washington and said the BOJ would continue
pursuing an aggressive monetary easing policy. “Achieving the 2% target is still a
long way off”. WSJ. http://on.wsj.com/2kPwAZ3
o Draghi spoke positively about Eurozone growth but he reiterated a cautious view
on inflation; Draghi said underlying inflation remains too weak and as a result the
ECB would need to continue providing large degrees of monetary accomodation.
WSJ http://on.wsj.com/2yLTeb9
o Central banks – tightening actions/rhetoric expected from three of the four major
central banks before the end of the year: EBC 10/26 (media reports suggest the
LSAP will be extended by 9 months w/the purchase pace tapered down from EU60B
to ~EU30B), BOE 11/2 (market expects a hike), and FOMC 12/13 (market expects a
hike).
*  Global central bankers and fin mins watch Fed chair process very closely – the identity of
the next Fed chair was as key topic of conversation at the weekend IMF/World Bank
meetings in Washington according to the WSJ (http://on.wsj.com/2gbzPor).
o Why will be the next Fed chair? All the media reports suggest the race is still
between Warsh and Powell (with the former person having a small edge) although
John Taylor’s name is being mentioned more (Thy God Emperor Trump interviewed Taylor at the
White House on Wed according to multiple media reports); of all the chair
candidates (Warsh, Powell, Yellen, Cohn, and Taylor), Taylor would likely cause the
most market disruption (at least initially). Larry Kudlow spoke on CNBC Fri
afternoon (after the market close) and said Thy God Emperor Trump’s decision could wind up being
a Warsh/Taylor combination (chair/vice chair).
*  Budget resolution vote coming up in the Senate (likely Thurs 10/19) - Larry Kudlow on
CNBC (at 4:40pmET Fri afternoon) reiterated that 50 GOP votes don't exist right now for
the budget resolution in the Senate (the vote is tentatively scheduled for Thurs
10/19). Republican Sen. Thad Cochran's health issues (which could keep him from
Washington) will complicate things for Republicans (Cochran was discussed in Politico Fri
morning http://politi.co/2i8Plpu).
o Sen. Collins said she would likely vote “yes” on the budget resolution this week
(passing the budget resolution is a necessary, but rather minor, step in the tax
process) – Reuters http://reut.rs/2wWzOvv
*  Taxes – passing a budget resolution is the easy part
o Republicans are still struggling to reach a consensus around the most controversial
pieces of the 9/27 blueprint. This week’s budget resolution vote is a necessary but
rather easy part of the tax process. The harder parts of the tax debate are still
waiting awaiting resolution – rates, brackets, income thresholds, deduction
changes, deficit tolerance, etc. BAT and SALT were supposed to be the key
incremental sources of revenue to pay for reduced rates but one is already scrapped
(BAT) and the other (SALT) is facing enormous resistance. Some media reports
suggest Republicans may reach a SALT compromise (whereby individuals with
annual incomes of ~$400K+ will lose the ability to deduct SALT) but this doesn’t
raise a whole lot of revenue. Even with reasonable dynamic scoring, it gets very
difficult to lower rates meaningfully without any incremental revenue.
o Tax – what will pass and when? Investors still think “something” can happen but
that something will likely be much less ambitious than the 9/27 GOP blueprint
(corporate rate to ~25-30% w/some lower/middle-income individual relief). Nearly
no one expects tax action in 2017.
o Tax – what is priced into stocks? This question is being asked w/increased
frequency but providing a precise answer is difficult. Roughly speaking, the St is
penciling in ~$138-143 in tax-free 2018 SPX EPS w/a tax bill adding ~$5-15. At the
middle of the tax-free range (i.e. $140) the SPX PE is ~18.2x – assuming investors
would try and keep the PE around ~17.5x that would imply a 2018 EPS expectation
of ~$145 which suggests stocks are assuming some benefit from tax (albeit a
relatively small one).
*  Thy God Emperor Trump risks overloading Congress – Thy God Emperor Trump has thrown several contentious issues in the lap
of Congress just as Senate and House Republicans undertake the most dramatic overhaul of
the tax code since ’86. Between immigration/DACA, the Iran nuclear pact, and
healthcare/ACA, Congress will be forced to act over the coming months while also juggling
the tax debate. WSJ http://on.wsj.com/2wUhTFF

speakers (including Yellen who speaks Fri 10/20 after the close). The US tax process will
continue w/the Senate voting on a budget resolution (likely Thurs 10/19) - passage is
expected but the final vote will likely be close; Rand Paul seems a hard “no” while McCain
and a few others are question marks; investors will be watching to see if any Democrats
cross the aisle. Keep in mind that the Senate budget resolution will need to be reconciled
w/the one from the House. Finally, the EU Leaders Summit runs 10/19-20 and the Japanese
snap election takes place Sun 10/22.

#Trading Update

* What’s happening this morning? Once again it was a slow evening. The US newswires are
filled w/previews of today’s big tax unveil but all the major numbers have been circulating
in the press for several days at least (see full preview below) and thus the actual release
may wind up being anticlimactic (note that Thy God-Emperor Trump is due to speak in Indiana on the subject
at ~3pmET). Keep in mind that the Wed tax blueprint is just the beginning of what will be
a very long and arduous process; while the odds of passing “something” are relatively good,
that “something” will likely look a lot different from what Republicans will unveil today
(the GOP plan is too ambitious and will need to be pared down). Overall US politics
dominated the overnight narrative as Moore won in Alabama (as expected), healthcare dies
(also as expected), Corker retires (not a complete shock but not fully anticipated),
“Establishment” Republicans shutter, Mueller advances, taxes arrive, and more. Eco
data/monetary policy was relatively minimal overnight (although the industrial profits
figure out of China was positive). The main co-specific news highlights included MU (solid
Q/guide; only mild neg. was elevated capital spending number but on the whole this was a
strong print), NKE (Q was OK but the guide fell short and the stock slumped during the afterhours
session), and Alstom/Siemens (they formally announced a merger of their train
operations). The major Eurozone indices are sitting on decent gains (up ~30-50bp); banks
are leading on the upside (SX7P up ~1.5%) thanks to the ongoing embrace of reflation
themes globally (recall this is a multi-week trading trend). Incidentally, the US BKX advance
remains very powerful and still has legs – the sector paused Fri/Mon but is having a hard
time sustaining material downside and eked out a small gain on Tues (it seems like this
latest BKX rally will be the one to finally break it up and out of its months-long trading
range). The major Asian indices were mixed – TPX -0.5%, NKY -0.31%, Hang Seng +0.47%,
SHCOMP +0.05%, HSCEI +0.61%, Taiwan TAIEX +0.68%, Korea KOSPI -0.07%, Australia -
0.12%, and India down ~1.1%. Taiwan’s TAIEX bounced following the US tech rally on Tues
(Largan +5.5%, Hon Hai +1.45%, TSMC +0.47%, Nanya Tech +4.3%, MediaTek +1.95%, etc.);
note that the US tech rally on Tues felt somewhat tentative and it seems like the space has
more to go on the downside over the coming days and weeks. US S&P futures are up ~2-4
points. The USD continues to rip higher (it’s up another ~40bp this morning) thanks to a
combination of Germany (as the election outcome continues to pressure the EUR), tax
anticipation (even though the tax plan will likely be deficit-negative, the USD is focused for
now on its growth implications), and Yellen (as the odds of a Dec hike continue to creep
higher).
* Calendar of events for Wed 9/27 – the focus will be on US durable goods for Aug
(8:30amET), US pending home sales for Aug (10amET), Fed speakers (Kashkari, Brainard,
Bullard and Rosengren), the Republican tax plan (Thy God-Emperor Trump to speak on the subject in Indiana
at ~3pmET), analyst meetings (AMAT, DLPH, KMX, PANW, and SPR), and earnings (ATU preopen
and JBL, PIR, PRGS, and THO after the close).

#Top Headlines for Wednesday

US politics – it was a big night of news as Moore wins, healthcare dies, Corker retires,
“Establishment” Republicans shutter, Mueller advances, taxes arrive, and more.

*  Republican tax blueprint – what to expect on Wed 9/27. It isn’t clear just how
much detail Republicans plan on releasing but the initial rough draft will likely call
for 1) bringing the corporate rate down to ~20% (from 35%), 2) cutting the top
“pass-through” (i.e. small business) rate to 25% (from 39.5%), 3) collapsing the
current seven individual brackets down to three (new brackets will be 12%, 25%,
and 35%), 4) cutting the top individual rate to 35% (from 39.5%) although the
language may allow for the creation of a new top individual rate if Congress needs
to find extra revenue, 5) a doubling of the individual standard deduction, 6)
eliminating the deductibility of corporate interest expense in some form (the
language around this topic will probably be vague), 7) immediate expensing of
corporate capital expenditures (although this may only be for a ~5 year period), 8) a
“deemed” tax on all accumulated overseas earnings (likely at a reduced rate of
~10%), 9) eliminating the deductibility of state/local taxes on individual returns (it
sounds like the proposal will retain the deductibility of mortgage interest and
charitable donations), and 10) eliminating the estate tax. In total, the plan will call
for tax cuts worth ~$5T over 10 years w/Republicans planning on recouping more
than half of that lost revenue by eliminating various tax breaks (not all of which will
be outlined today). Combined w/dynamic scoring, the net tax cut number over 10
years is thought to be around ~$1.5T. Overall, the Wed draft should only be
thought of as a “best case” opening offer as it won’t likely resemble the final
agreement (to the extent there even is a final agreement). Most assume the
ultimate bill will simply cut the corporate rate from 35% to ~25-27% w/some action
 on the repatriation front and w/o substantive deduction (or individual) changes. As
for timing, it is expected that this will be a Q1:2018 event.
* Thy God-Emperor Trump will begin advocating for the tax bill at an event in Indiana on Wed (he is
scheduled to begin speaking around 3pmET) but some Republicans are worried
about what he’ll say – Thy God-Emperor Trump’s lack of message discipline, coupled w/his
extemporaneous speaking style, is making Republicans nervous as they head into
the heart of the tax process. Politico http://politi.co/2wVJ5mw
* McCain makes similar demands on taxes that he did for healthcare (McCain was
instrumental in killing the last two ACA repeal/replace attempts) – McCain is
demanding regular order and a bipartisan approach to the tax process – Bloomberg
https://bloom.bg/2hvOG17
* Taxes - House Freedom Caucus head (Mark Meadows) sets out tough ""red lines""
for upcoming tax debate - Meadows said he would vote against a tax reform
measure if it included a corporate tax rate higher than 20% (the GOP blueprint on
Wed is likely to propose 20% but most think the final number will likely be closer to
25% if not higher), set a small business rate at more than 25 percent (the Wed
proposal will contain a ""pass-through"" rate of 25%), and didn’t double the standard
deduction for individuals (the proposal is expected to do this). The
Hill. http://bit.ly/2fPdzRy
*  Wilbur Ross says tax reform “done right” could boost annual GDP growth by
~100bp – CNBC http://cnb.cx/2wW5253
*  Moore’s win (following the failure to repeal ACA and Corker’s retirement) spells
trouble for “establishment” Republicans heading into ’18 midterms – Moore’s
victory will embolden conservative challengers across the country, setting the stage
for “a wave of resource-draining primaries”. McConnell is apparently increasingly
concerned about the Republican majority; he had hoped to head into the ’18
midterms on the offensive but isn’t as confident now. Politico
http://politi.co/2xvU36Y
*  The healthcare reconciliation deadline of 9/30 won’t be extended – while some in
the GOP want to extend the 9/30 healthcare reconciliation deadline and couple the
issue w/taxes, Congressional Republican leaders have squashed this idea
(http://bit.ly/2k0O9oG). Once the deadline passes on 9/30 the repeal/replace
debate will (finally) end (at least until 11/7/18).
*  Infrastructure spending plan increasingly in doubt – Thy God-Emperor Trump apparently is skeptical
about the practicality of public-private partnerships when it comes to infrastructure
spending. This had been the heart of the GOP infrastructure plan and thus Thy God-Emperor Trump’s
new views would point to the odds of an actual bill passing being even lower than
previously thought. Washington Post http://wapo.st/2fx3z2q
*  US/Canada trade – Washington said it would impose stiff tariffs on sales of a new
Bombardier jetliner to US airlines. Meanwhile, Alstom and Siemens decided to
move forward w/a merger of their train operations (Bombardier had been involved
in the negotiations but wound up being left out). WSJ. http://on.wsj.com/2fPNr9e
*  Mueller could begin interviewing current and former White House staff as soon as
later this week (CNN http://cnn.it/2jYI6Rs) and the IRS is now providing
information to the probe (http://cnn.it/2wVdbGO). Meanwhile, Paul Manafort
expects to be indicted (http://nyti.ms/2xvNst5).
* Acting DEA head Chuck Rosenberg will step down after clashing w/the White
House; Rosenberg had become convinced that Thy God-Emperor Trump had little respect for the law –
NYT http://nyti.ms/2foG47W
* Economic data/monetary policy recap for Wed 9/27 – it was a pretty uneventful morning.
China industrial profits came in +24% Y/Y in Aug, a solid acceleration vs. +16.5% posted in
Jul (http://bit.ly/2xvxmzE). Europe’s M3 money supply growth for Aug came in +5% (ahead
of the St’s +4.6% foreacst). A new survey finds that German exporters are increaisngly
upbeat on the business outlook despite a rising euro (http://reut.rs/2fQlJsW).
*  San Francisco Fed President Williams conducted an interview
w/Centralbanking.com (the headlines hit after the US market closed). Williams
reiterated his prior call for the Fed to consider a higher inflation target but he
added that this is something central banks should contemplate on a coordinated
basis globally. Williams thinks the 2% inflation target utilized by most central banks
around the world will be ""suboptimal"" over the next 10 years. Williams also thinks
that policies once considered unconventional (like QE, forward guidance, etc.) will in
fact become conventional. http://bit.ly/2fqe3gi
* Europe has too many banks according to an ECB official - Daniele Nouy, the ECB’s top bank
supervisor, said Europe had too many banks and called on the industry to shrink and
consolidate. Reuters. http://reut.rs/2fAsUbP

#Company-specific news update from Tues night 9/26. 

* It was a pretty slow evening other than a couple of high-profile Aug-end earnings reports. MU posted very strong Aug-end
results and guided Nov above the St and while the numbers should be enough to stabilize
the stock it seems like the tech sell-off in general still has a bit more to go (MU’s F18 capex
guide of $7.5B was above $6-6.5B estimates and the news briefly hit the stock after-hours
although mgmt. on the call made clear none of the money was going towards expanding its
wafer capacity). NKE’s results were OK for the Q, esp. given horrendous sentiment around
the stock and the category; the stock briefly bounced Tues night on the news before sliding
lower deeper in the after-hours session (the guidance, given out on the call, fell short of
expectations). Elsewhere, TWTR said it would explore an expansion of its character limit
(from 140 to 280 characters http://on.wsj.com/2hvDCRF) while Alstom and Siemens
formally announced their train merger plans (http://on.wsj.com/2jZXUmZ).
* S/Sprint, TMUS - the FCC approved (by a 3-2 vote) a new report concluding that there is
now “effective competition” in the US wireless market for the first time since 2009; the
ruling could help pave the way for a TMUS-Sprint combination (http://reut.rs/2xzmuhG).
* Nippon Life, Japan’s largest private-sector life insurer, is in talks to buy a 20-30% stake in
US asset manager TCW Group from Carlyle (which owns ~60%). TCW had ~$200B in AUM
as of the end of June. Reuters. http://reut.rs/2hviWsN
* Chinese cities order steel output cuts to begin earlier than expected in a bid to curb
pollution – Reuters http://reut.rs/2hylhQb
Calendar of events to watch for the week of Mon Sept 25
* Calendar of events for Thurs 9/28 – the focus will be on Eurozone confidence measures for
Sept (5amET), German inflation for Sept (8amET), the BOE “20 Years On” conf. in London
(at which Carney will speak), US Q2 data revisions (8:30amET), US advance goods trade
balance for Aug (8:30amET), Fed speakers (George, Fischer, Bostic), Brady’s comments on
tax reform, analyst meetings (AEE and AFL), and earnings (ACN, BBRY, CAG, MKC, MTN, and
RAD pre-open and KBH and SGH after the close).
* Calendar of events for Fri 9/29 – the focus will be on the China Caixin manufacturing PMI
for Sept (Thurs night/Fri morning), the German jobs data for Sept (3:55amET), Eurozone CPI
for Sept (5amET), US personal income/spending for Aug (8:30amET), the US PCE for Aug
(8:30amET), the Chicago PMI for Sept (9:45amET), the final Michigan Confidence numbers
for Sept (10amET), Fed speakers (Harker), and analyst meetings (CMP).
US equity bull vs. bear debate – Tues 9/26/17
* Bottom Line: US equities wobbled briefly around mid-Aug but quickly (and unexpectedly)
found their footing before levitating back to fresh highs throughout H2:Aug and H1:Sept. A
big driver of stock stability has been a macro landscape that is unfolding in a much less
volatile and uncontroversial fashion than feared coupled with the market’s ability to cleanly
rotate from sector to sector. The one main constant of the last several months has been a
relatively healthy real growth backdrop and thus this will hold the key for stocks going
forward (i.e. it will be growth and not North Korea, the Fed, Thy God-Emperor Trump, etc., that will determine
if and when the rally reverses). The recent appearance of firmer inflation figures globally,
coupled w/ongoing real growth stability, has helped to fuel a reembrace of reflation themes
(more specifically TSY weakness and bank strength) and a continuation of this trend would
be the ideal scenario for the broader tape (the two caveats are the USD and tech – the
former can’t spike higher and the latter’s weakness needs to stay relatively orderly and
calm).

#Reasons to be optimistic

* Nothing changes – real growth stays steady (below “escape velocity” but in the ~2-2.5% real
GDP range), inflation firms but stays at or slightly below central bank targets, central banks
stay on the normalization path but proceed at an extraordinarily subdued pace, the USD
doesn’t rally materially, and Corporate America performance remains robust (thanks to
aggressive cost containment, a softer USD, healthy global growth, etc.). Such a scenario
would encourage the gentle pro-reflation market biases of the last few weeks.
* Monetary policy will stay enormously accommodative even with Fed tightening -
JPMorgan’s Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote about the G4 (FOMC, ECB, BOE, and BOJ) central
banks and projects that aggregate balance sheets will be little changed over the coming 3-
4 years despite Fed normalization (the note was published 9/22 http://bit.ly/2xAACJL). As
Bernanke noted on numerous occasions during the financial crisis, QE provides
accommodation via “stock” and not “flow” (i.e. it is the ownership of assets that matters
and central bank balance sheets will stay enlarged for years to come).
* Recession risk not imminent – JPMorgan’s Joe Lupton and Bruce Kasman addressed the
risks of a US recession and don’t think they are particularly large in the near-term (the note
was published 9/20/17). Recessions are related to: 1) weakening labor productivity; 2)
downward pressure on corporate margins; 3) central bank tightening; 4) real and financial
private sector imbalances. Although we anticipate these vulnerabilities to eventually arise,
they are not particularly threatening at present. Monetary policy is still easy and being
normalized at a glacial pace. The near-term risk of recession is not large, but the US could
prove to be the catalyst for the next DM downturn. The full note can be found here:
http://bit.ly/2wTZRCK.
* The odds of Republicans accomplishing something on the tax front are decent – while it’s
very unlikely the corporate rate gets down to 15% or 20%, the GOP should be able to clip a
few hundred basis points off the corporate rate by the end of CQ1:18 (in conjunction
w/some type of action easing the repatriation of overseas earnings).
* Kelly continues to exert a positive influence at the White House – Donald Thy God-Emperor Trump will never
be without controversy but the Kelly-run White House has been a much more disciplined
and focused institution compared to the chaos that seemed to reign under Reince. If this
can continue (and that is a big “if” as the divisive NFL remarks make clear) it will help
Republicans pass pieces of their pro-growth agenda.
* Debt ceiling no longer considered a key negotiating tool – while both sides still make
demands around the debt ceiling process this no longer is an instrument about which either
side are very comfortable making serious threats.
* Valuations are rich but not ridiculous – investors are assuming ~$140 in ’18 SPX EPS and
that doesn’t include much happening in Washington (a tax bill could add $7-10+ in EPS). At
2500 the SPX is trading at ~17.8x a $140 number (that falls to ~17x if taxes winds up
bumping $140 to ~$145-147).
* Sentiment is far from euphoric – while the VIX remains subdued it’s hard to accuse the
market of being effusive or complacent as investors are anxious over a host of issues
(balance sheet normalization, NK missiles, White House dysfunction, elevated valuations,
etc.).

#Reasons to be cautious

* Yields hit fresh lows in response to softening nominal growth – while many regard the
prospect of a “taper tantrum”-like move (around upcoming balance sheet normalization) to
be the biggest risk facing stocks, a larger headwind for the market could come from a surge
in TSYs (and slump in yields) as a result of nominal growth weakness (softness in real
growth would have a larger impact than further disinflation).
* The yield curve flattens aggressively as Fed tightening elevates 2yr yields while 10yr yields
hold steady or drift lower – a flattening driven by 10yr strength (i.e. 10yr yields moving
lower) would be a larger risk to stocks than one spurred by Fed-driven 2yr weakness (i.e. 2yr
yields moving higher) but regardless sustained flattening wouldn’t be helpful for risk
sentiment (in particular banks would be at risk in such a scenario).
* Central banks sow concern via either policy and/or staffing changes. Three of the world’s
major central banks are proceeding with gradual normalization but this isn’t likely to pose
much near-term risk to stocks (as policy in aggregate remains extraordinarily
accommodative). The next big events to watch are the ECB on 10/26 (at which it will
provide 2018 tapering guidance) and the BOE on 11/2 (at which it is expected to raise rates).
Instead of policy the bigger risks are prob. around staffing, esp. at the Fed where Thy God-Emperor Trump
has several positions to fill (including the chair). Meanwhile, Kuroda’s term at the BOJ ends
in Apr ’18 (Draghi and Carney will be in office for a while longer – Carney’s term ends June
’19 and Draghi is in place until Oct ’19).
* Republicans fail to pass any substantive pieces of pro-growth legislation before the Nov
’18 midterms – the GOP failed to move repeal/replace through Congress and the tax debate
is proving to be just as divisive as healthcare (prominent Republican Senators Hatch and
Corker have both warned that taxes will be more difficult than healthcare was). The odds of
passing a tax bill are higher than healthcare (the former isn’t nearly as controversial as the
latter) but the initial GOP blueprint is too ambitious and will need to be pared down over
the coming months.
* Tax details surprise – most are anticipating a mild cut to the corporate rate w/o any
substantive changes to the code. However, while the BAT has been discarded Washington
still could look towards other areas to raise revenue (including eliminating the deductibility
of corporate interest expense and/or individual state and local taxes).
* Fiscal challenges still loom – current legislation funds the government only until 12/8 which
means a shutdown could occur around year-end if budget progress isn’t achieved (and note
that a budget is necessarily in order to pass taxes via reconciliation). The debt ceiling likely
won’t become binding again until the end of CQ1:18 at the earliest.
* USD spikes – the months-long stretch of USD softness has helped underwrite the equity
rally and thus a prolonged period of strength would undermine stock enthusiasm. However,
while the German election outcome bolstered the USD (by weakening the EUR), it doesn’t
seem like an extended stretch of strengthening is imminent (other central banks are
normalizing alongside the FOMC while the nominal growth differential doesn’t grossly favor
the US vs. other major economies).
* Geopolitical risks remain unresolved – North Korea is moving forward w/its nuclear and
missile programs, Syria is still unresolved, the battle against ISIS continues, eastern Ukraine
remains under occupation, tensions between Iran and Gulf States persist in the Middle East,
and more. While NK is dominating the geopolitical narrative, the status of the Iran nuclear
deal may be just as big a threat (Thy God-Emperor Trump has a decision to make in Oct about whether Iran is
compliant w/that agreement).
* Difficult for the US economy to overcome its enormous structural headwinds – the
conversation around the growth potential of the US economy remains too optimistic with
not enough appreciation given to the extraordinary structural headwinds facing it (namely
tepid productivity and demographic trends). Regardless of what happens in Washington it
will be difficult to return to ‘90s-like economic growth.

Significant Insider Trading Activity (Last 7 Days),32,dgn25e,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dgn25e/significant_insider_trading_activity_last_7_days/,23,2019-10-12 04:56:25,"This is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.
The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.
In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information
that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,
insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good
track record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.

"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning June 24th, 2019",50,c3sf2u,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c3sf2u/wall_street_week_ahead_for_the_trading_week/,19,2019-06-22 23:00:01,"Good afternoon and happy Saturday to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this subreddit made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning June 24th, 2019.

# **What to watch in the market in the week ahead: Stocks on track for best first half in 22 years  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/21/what-to-watch-in-the-market-in-the-week-ahead-stocks-on-track-for-best-first-half-in-22-years.html)**
*****
> The fate of U.S.-China trade talks could play out in the week ahead, and that could set the tone for markets and the economy in the second half of the year.
*****
> Stocks set new highs in the past week, after the Federal Reserve signaled it was ready to cut interest rates if necessary, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell said trade and the global economy are two factors the Fed is watching.
*****
> The S&P 500 was on track, as of Friday, to score a more than 17.6% gain for the first half, which ends Friday. If it stays at that level that would be the best first half performance since 1997, when the S&P was up 19.4% in the first six months.
*****
> The big event in the coming week has been as anticipated for weeks, and it could sway sentiment for weeks to come. At the end of the week, the G-20 meets in Osaka Japan for meetings Friday and Saturday.
*****
> ‘Could go either way’
> President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are expected to have their own dinner meeting at the G-20 next weekend, following discussions between their trade representatives. That meeting could decide how trade negotiations go forward, and whether the U.S. proceeds with another round of tariffs, this time on $300 billion in goods.
*****
> “Everybody knows the Trump, Xi meeting could go either way,” said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex. “I think everyone expects a new tariff freeze. That the $300 billion won’t go into effect. The most you can hope for out of G-20 meeting is the tariffs are where they are right now, and there’s no more escalation.That also means China will not release the list of companies they won’t do business with.”
*****
> Chandler said he will be looking for signaling from Trump and Xi on whether they are working on a deal that would be just on the trade topics, or bigger issues like North Korea and differences on the South China Sea.
*****
> “I do think the G-20 is quite important in that there’s not question in recent months, the trade war started to really move into measures of confidence and measures of manufacturing activity,” said Ethan Harris, head of global economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Harris said he expects a positive message with an agreement of no further escalation, but probably not signs of significant progress. “I think the vibes coming out of it will be modestly positive,” he said.
*****
> “Whether there’s an escalation to the next round of China tariffs is going to set the theme for the rest of the year. Even if tariffs on China are reversed, or partly reversed, at some point, every time there’s an escalation or temporary escalation, it’s another kind of blow to confidence,” he said.
*****
> Harris said there’s the same risk as after the Trump, Xi meeting at the last G-20, where it was a positive tone but there was little progress afterwards and the markets then reacted negatively.
*****
> “I think there’s been this broad increased awareness from every economist that the trade war is starting to have noticeable impact. Further escalation with China would be quite a big signal. If the Trump administration puts tariffs on all the Chinese products it roughly doubles the size of the trade war and it sends a very strong message that there are very few constraints on where [Trump] goes next,” he said.
*****
> Powell and data
> Besides the meeting between Trump and Xi, the market focus will be on anything that could provide clues on what the Fed or even the European Central Bank will do, after ECB President Mario Draghi last week basically promised a new era of easing. Consumer price inflation data is expected for the euro zone, and on Friday, the U.S. personal consumption expenditure data is released, including the PCE deflator, a major inflation indicator for the Fed.
*****
> There are also a few Fed speakers, including Powell who speaks at the Council on Foreign Relations Tuesday.
*****
> “It’s probably going to be a big picture kind of talk about the broader challenges of the Fed,” said Ethan Harris, head of global economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. “They’re certainly going to ask questions about political influence at the Fed, and he’s going to dodge those. I think what I’m waiting for him to comment on is what it is they’re looking for to determine whether they’re going to cut in July or not.”
*****
> Harris said Powell is not likely to say anything he did not reveal at his press briefing in the past week, and the big focus will be on the lead up to the weekend G-20.
*****
> Falling interest rates and rising oil prices were two big factors in the market int he past week. The 10-year Treasury yield dipped briefly below 2%, a near 3-year low, as the Fed signaled its willingness to cut interest rates.
*****
> “Should we get some sort of trade agreement that would be a nice pop to the [stock] market, but that could take the rate cut off the table,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.
*****
> Stovall said the stock market will also be watching oil after its rapid run higher, and the events in the Middle East surrounding Iran. West Texas Intermediate futures were up more than 9% in the past week, to $57.43.
*****
> “The old adage is every $10 increase in the price of oil takes off 20 to 25 basis points off of real GDP growth,” he said.
*****
> Stovall said stocks have had a solid run so far this year, but they may face some rocky times between now and the end of the summer. “For the rest of this ‘sell in May’ period we could be facing some challenges, headwinds. I think we’ will still end higher on the year. I think the seasonally optimistic September to November period will kick in but there will be a lot of challenges...will the Fed be cutting rates? what are the growth prospects?” he said.

# Big S&P 500 Junes Drain Life from Julys

> S&P 500 is off to it best June performance since 1955, up 7.34% as of yesterday’s close. If yesterday was the last trading day of June, this performance would have been strong enough to push the month to 6th best going back to 1930. Looking back to late May, this performance is still impressive even though it was anticipated following May’s abysmal showing. However, such strong performance in June may not carry over into July.

> Below S&P 500 performance in June has been split into positive and negative tables. Each table contains July’s historical performance as well as full-year performance. Historically July has been weaker after a positive June. July averages just 0.48% after an up June compared to a gain of 2.84% after a down June. Examining the Top 20 Junes and subsequent Julys showed only a modest improvement in performance with average July gain climbing to 1.11%. However, even if July does disappoint this year, the full year is likely to still be quite fair as past positive Junes where followed by full-year gains 80% of the time with an average gain of 13.44%.

# Can Stocks Really Gain 20% This Year?

> U.S. stocks could have a big year if LPL Research’s forecasts prove correct.

> All year, we’ve maintained our fair value target on the S&P 500 Index of 3,000, implying that we expect this bull market and economic expansion to continue. If the S&P 500 closes the year at 3,000, the index will have gained 19.7% in 2019.

> On the surface, that seems like a high hurdle for U.S. stocks. However, the S&P 500 has already gained about 16% this year, so a rally to 3,000 isn’t far out of reach.

> The S&P 500 also hasn’t posted a 20% gain for the year since 2013, an unusually long stretch compared to history.

> “It is interesting that the S&P 500 hasn’t gained more than 20% in any one year for five consecutive years,” noted LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Only once since 1950 did it go more than five years in a row without gaining 20%, thus if this pattern continues we very well might get to 20% in 2019.”

> As our LPL Chart of the Day “Can The S&P 500 Index Really Gain 20% This Year?” shows, it is quite rare for the S&P 500 to go this long without a 20% annual gain. Could the streak end in 2019? Be sure to read our Midyear Outlook 2019, which is set for release next week, for more on why this could be the case.

# Prospect of Lower Rates Lifts Gold

> As widely anticipated, the Fed did not change its target rate today. Instead, the Fed set the stage for cuts possibly later this year. Overall, the market’s response was a choppy climb to a modestly higher close. A more enthusiastic move by the market may have occurred if the Fed cut rates. Gold’s reaction was more favorable, finishing the day higher by over 1%. Generally, the lower interest rates go, the more desirable gold can become as lower rates typically result in a weaker dollar.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/06ee5a896971da25f3f06e3861567f44/tumblr_inline_ptd73ep0rI1spdppr_500.jpg))**

> In the above chart, gold’s monthly performance from 1975 to 2018 is displayed. Historically, October has been gold’s worst month and June is a close second. Historically, after weakness in June, gold has, on average, enjoyed solid gains in July, August and September. Some of this strength in gold is likely due to safe-haven demand during the stock market’s worst two months, August and September. Gold’s best three months, July to September, could easily be above average this year, especially if the Fed decides to cut sooner rather than later.

# Are Bulls An Endangered Species?

> The S&P 500 Index closed at a new all-time high yesterday, the 5th new high so far in 2019. After May, the worst month for the S&P 500 since 2010, June is up 7.3% as of 06.20.19, which would be the best June since 1955.

> Much of the rally this month has been sparked by a more dovish Federal Reserve (Fed), combined with U.S.-China trade discussions potentially back on track.

> What’s quite interesting about things now though, is many signs of investor sentiment are a long way from bullish. Remember, from a contrarian (or opposing) point of view, this can suggest there is still money on the sidelines.

> “The S&P 500 might be at new highs, but global fund managers and individual investors are quite underweight equities right now,” explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “If you are looking for a reason this rally can continue, that could be it.”

> For example, the recent Bank of America Merrill Lynch June Global Fund Manager Survey (a survey of managers who oversee more than $600 billion in assets) showed the largest jump in cash since August 2011. Additionally, equity allocation was the lowest it had been since March 2009, and the equity-to-bond allocation was the lowest since May 2009. Not to mention the allocation to bonds was the highest it had been in eight years. “Money on the sidelines might sound cliché, but it really seems to be the case this time,” said Detrick. With the S&P 500 hitting more all-time highs, having money in the market may make more sense (or cents!).

> Individual investors are skeptical as well, as the recent American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) Sentiment Survey showed more bears than bulls for six straight weeks, the longest stretch since November 2016. Finally, as our LPL Chart of the Day shows, AAII bulls have been under 30% for six consecutive weeks for the first time since January 2016.

# Broad Strength in Health Care Sector

> In an earlier post, we highlighted the fact that some of the ten best performing S&P 500 Industries between the S&P 500's highs on 4/30 and 6/20 were from the Health Care sector. It hasn't just been these four industries that have been strong in the Health Care sector either. The performance snapshot of the sector below shows just how strong the sector has been lately. While all six of the industries within the sector aren't up YTD or so far in Q2, between the S&P 500's highs on 4/30 and 6/20, Health Care is the only sector where every industry within the sector has posted positive returns. Not even the industries within the Utilities sector have been this uniformly positive. The best performer of the bunch has been Health Care Technology, which is up 8% since the end of April and has extended its YTD gain to 36.8%. The worst performing industry in the sector has been Biotech which is up 2.1% since 4/30, and while that may not sound like much, it's still better than more than half of the other industries in the index.

# Best and Worst Groups Between Highs

> While the S&P 500 made a new high for the first time in 35 trading days yesterday, many of the characteristics of the groups driving the rally have shifted. To highlight this, in the table below we summarize the ten best and worst performing S&P 500 Industries from the close on 4/30 through yesterday. During that 35 trading day stretch, 34 Industries saw positive returns while another 27 declined.

> Industries that have seen the biggest gains between the two new highs are primarily defensive in nature as all but three come from sectors that are typically considered defensive (Consumer Staples, Health Care, and Real Estate). Health Care has been the real star of the show, though. Of the sector's six different industries, four of them made the top ten!

> On the downside, cyclical industries have dominated the weak side. When industries like Semis, Autos, Construction & Engineering, and Air Freight are lagging the market, it really illustrates the presence of economic concerns. Leading the way lower, Energy Equipment and Services declined over 10%, followed by Semiconductors which were down just under 10% after failing at resistance on Thursday for the third time in a month. These two industries are followed by two industries (Tobacco and Power and Renewable Energy) that come from sectors that are traditionally considered defensive, but they have their own specific issues to deal with.

#[Today's Top Headlines for Thursday, April 2nd, 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/02/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-april-2-2020.html)

*****

> * U.S. stock futures were pointing to an over 300-point rebound for the Dow Jones Industrial Average at Thursday’s open ahead of what’s expected to be another unprecedented number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits. The Dow closed nearly 4.5% lower on the first day of the second quarter after logging the worst first-quarter ever. The 10-year Treasury yield dropped to under 0.6% early Thursday as global coronavirus cases approach 1 million. Oil futures bounced about 10% from highly depressed levels after President Donald Trump said he expected Saudi Arabia and Russia to reach a deal soon to end their price war.

*****

> * Economists expect that 4 million to 5 million, or even more, workers filed for jobless claims last week. The Labor Department releases its weekly tally at 8:30 a.m. ET. The consensus forecast is for 3.1 million first-time claims after the previous week’s record high of nearly 3.3. million. On Friday, the government issues its monthly report on job creation. However, the March numbers are expected to show little impact from the outbreak because the survey period went only to about the middle of the month — before the effects of the stay-at-home orders were felt.

*****

> * The president is set to meet with the leaders of at least seven major energy companies on Friday as U.S. producers struggle to break even after crude prices recently hit 18-year lows and turned in the worst quarter ever. Trump, at Wednesday evening’s outbreak briefing, said the administration is considering halting some domestic flights and rail lines between cities hard hit by the virus. Also Wednesday, White House health advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said the first human trial testing a potential vaccine to prevent COVID-19 is “on track” with public distribution still projected in 12 to 18 months. He called it the “ultimate game changer” in the fight to control the pandemic.

*****

> * With coronavirus testing becoming more widespread, U.S. confirmed cases surged to more than 216,700, according to Johns Hopkins University data. American fatalities rose to 5,137. The White House, predicting a “very, very painful two weeks,” estimates a death toll of 100,000 to 240,000. Globally, known cases reached about 942,000 — nearing 1 million since the outbreak started in China in December. There have been 47,521 worldwide deaths and about 186,000 recoveries. Italy has the second most cases globally at more than 110,500, nearly half the U.S. total. But it has the most deaths, 13,155.

*****

> * Boeing — whose stock has been slammed by the coronavirus economic halt and last year’s grounding of its 737 Max fleet — is reportedly set to start offering early retirement and buyout packages to workers. Several media outlets, including The Wall Street Journal, said that an internal announcement is expected as soon as Thursday. Last week, Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun said it will take “a few years” for the company to get its balance sheet back in shape, but he balked at the idea of the government taking an equity stake in the company in exchange for aid.

Today’s Bullish Activity

Moving higher this morning is McCormick & Company Inc. (MKC + $11.38 to $167.68) after the spice maker reported Q3 earnings of $1.46 per share, excluding non-recurring items ($0.17 beat) on revenue that rose 0.8% year-over-year to $1.33B (below the $1.34B expected). The company raised full-year 2019 EPS guidance to a range of $5.30-5.35 (from a prior view of $5.20-5.30B), which the company is attributing to a projected adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 20%. Calls are slightly outnumbering puts with the October 18th 170.00 call being the most actively traded contract (volume is 995).   

Also trading to the upside is ULTA Beauty Inc. (ULTA + $13.30 to $263.95) following news that global superstar and fashion icon Jennifer Lopez will launch her new perfume (Promise) exclusively at ULTA salons in the United States. Shares of ULTA are trading at a one-month high this morning. Calls are outnumbering puts roughly 2:1 with the October 4th 270.00 call topping the most actives list (volume is 2,035).

Lastly, several stocks are trading to the upside on analyst upgrades/price target increases:

Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc. (ACAD + $0.98 to $36.97): RBC Capital Markets initiated coverage on the biopharmaceutical company with an “Outperform” rating and put a $60.00 price target on the stock; calls are outnumbering puts roughly 5:2 with the December 20th 50.00 call seeing the most action from traders (volume is 250).  
Analog Devices Inc. (ADI + $1.11 to $112.84): KeyBanc Capital Markets upgraded the chipmaker to “Overweight” from “Sector-Weight” and put a $130.00 price target on the stock; calls are outnumbering puts roughly 3:2 but the January 2020 95.00 put is the most actively traded contract (volume is 287).
National Vision Holdings Inc. (EYE + $0.71 to $24.79): Bank of America/Merrill Lynch upgraded the optical retailer to “Buy” from “Neutral”; option volume is relatively light with the January 2020 20.00 call being the most actively traded contract (volume is 6).  
VMware Inc. (VMW + $3.96 to $154.02): Wells Fargo upgraded the enterprise software maker to “Outperform” from “Market Perform” and hiked their price target to $180.00 from $140.00, citing optimism over the release of VMware Tanzu along with benefits of recent acquisitions (Bitname, Heptio and Pivotal Software); call volume is dominating (~8:1 over puts) with the October 11th 152.50 call being the most actively traded contract (volume is 1,717).
 

New 52-week highs (57 new highs today): Asbury Automotive Group Inc. (ABG - $0.49 to $101.84), Jack-In-The-Box Inc. (JACK + $1.11 to $92.23), Proofpoint Inc. (PFPT + $2.91 to $131.96), Ross Stores Inc. (ROST + $0.74 to $110.59)

Notable Call Activity

Some unusual call activity (~7:1 over puts) is being seen in Activision Blizzard Inc. (ATVI - $0.28 to $52.64) as all of the top 10 most actively traded contracts are calls. Option traders were primarily targeting the October 11th 55.00 call as volume is 19,630 versus open interest of 251, so we know that this primarily represents new positioning. The bulk of the activity on this contract consisted of various-sized blocks that were being bought at the ask price of $0.47, including a 3,800 block that was bought at the ask price of $0.47, which suggests bullish intent. Note: Earlier this morning Activision announced that Call of Duty: Mobile is now available in all countries and regions where Google Play and App Store are supported with the exception of Mainland China, Vietnam, and Belgium.   

Masco Corp. (MAS + $0.70 to $42.38): Calls are outpacing puts roughly 16:1 which is primarily being driven by activity on the October 18th 44.00 call. Volume on this contract is 5,192 (vs. open interest of 1,490) which mostly consisted of various-sized blocks that were being bought at the ask price of $0.55, including a 2,500 block that was bought at the ask price of $0.55 (suggesting bullish intent).  

Today’s Bearish Activity 

Moving lower this morning is McDonald’s Corp. (MCD - $5.44 to $209.27) after J.P. Morgan analyst John Ivankoe lowered his third quarter comparable same-store sales expectation to up 5% from up 6% (vs. the +5.5% consensus estimate). However, Ivankoe reiterated his “Overweight” rating and $230.00 price target on the stock and acknowledged the company’s “otherwise solid underlying fundamentals”. Calls and puts are trading roughly even with the October 4th 207.50 put seeing the most action from traders (volume is 1,039).

Also trading to the downside is Canadian National Railway Inc. (CNI - $2.16 to $87.70) after Stephens downgraded the Canadian railroad operator to “Equal-Weight” and lowered their price target to $97.00 from $100.00. Stephens’ analyst Justin Long cited recent volume underperformance, a “tough” Q4 volume comparison and a more mature model that could make significant cost cuts more difficult. Today’s ~2.5% drop puts CNI below its 200-day Simple Moving Average (currently $88.60) for the first time since February. Puts are outnumbering calls nearly 2:1 with the January 2020 80.00 put leading the way (volume is 50).    

 

New 52-week lows (47 new lows today): Biomarin Pharmaceuticals Inc. (BMRN - $1.47 to $65.93), Canopy Growth Corp. (CGC - $0.97 to $21.96), E-Trade Financial Corp. (ETFC - $7.77 to $35.91), TD Ameritrade Inc. (AMTD - $10.05 to $36.65)

Notable Put Activity

Some unusual put activity (~8:1 over calls) is being seen in the SPDR Select Sector Utilities ETF (XLU - $0.34 to $64.40) which is primarily being driven by some block activity out on the December 20th expiration:

61.00 put (open interest is 21,525) – A 15K block was bought for $0.76 and (separately) a 4,910 block was bought at the ask price of $0.72
58.00 put (open interest is 5,344) – A 15K block was sold at the bid price of $0.35 and (separately) a 4,910 block was sold at the bid price of $0.33
The two blocks on each contract (15K & 4,910) were coded as spread trades, but we don’t know whether this was a roll-up (from the 58.00 to the 61.00 strike price) or a 61.00/58.00 bear put spread(s).

Vipshop Holdings Ltd. (VIPS + $0.01 to $8.93): Puts are outpacing calls ~18:1 which is primarily being driven by a 20K block that was bought at the ask price of $0.30 (open interest is 45,071). It’s likely that this is a new position given the open interest figure but we can’t be sure given the open interest figure.

Volume Signals     

Apple Inc. (AAPL + $1.55 to $225.50): Apple is no stranger to heavy option volume but 3 out of the top 4 most actively traded option contracts across the board today are AAPL calls that expire at the end of this week as the stock makes a push towards all-time highs (intraday high today is $228.22 vs. all-time high of $233.47):

232.50 call – option volume is 49,653 vs. open interest of 4,463
230.00 call – option volume is 40,019 vs. open interest of 15,190
227.50 call – option volume is 34,619 vs. open interest of 16,401
Halliburton Company (HAL - $0.17 to $18.68): Option volume is running at roughly 5x the daily average of 11,342 contracts which is primarily being driven by activity on the November 15th 20.00 call (the #1 most actively traded option contract on the board today). Volume on this contract is 55,327 versus open interest of 7,684, so we know that this primarily represents new positioning. The majority of the activity on this contract consisted of various-sized blocks that were being bought at various times at the ask prices of $0.83, $0.84 and $0.85 which suggests bullish intent.

PG&E Corp. (PCG - $0.06 to $9.94): A 6,725 block was bought on the October 18th 11.00 call at the ask price of $0.72 (open interest of 770). We know this block is a new position given the open interest figure and we can assume the intent is bullish in nature since the trade took place at the ask price.

Gauging Volatility

The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX + 1.65 to 17.89) has been on both sides of the unchanged line today (intraday range is 15.79-18.38) as equity markets are firmly lower around the mid-day mark today (DJI - 260, SPX - 25, COMPX - 54). VIX option volume has been tepid today at 156,502 contracts (#8 on the top 10 most actives list) and the activity has been call-biased (the volume put/call ratio is currently 0.60). The most actively traded contract is the October 16th 20.00 call as volume is 13,245 versus open interest of 159,708."

# **Stocks getting a bit frothy after move higher, could pause as more earnings roll out  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/18/stocks-getting-a-bit-frothy-after-move-higher-could-pause-in-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> Stocks have gotten a boost from optimismfor U.S.-China trade talks, but earnings could take a bigger role in the week ahead, when reports roll in from a diverse group of companies in tech, railroads, pharma, airlines and consumer products.
*****
> Stocks closed higher for a fourth week, amid talk the market may be getting overbought. The S&P 500 was up 2.9 percent for the week, to 2,670, giving it a gain of 13.6 percent from the Dec. 24 closing low. Going into the week, strategists were wondering if the S&P could even hold above the 2,600 level, a key area of resistance, but it punched through the level, ending the week above the band of resistance.
*****
> ""I think the market had made even the pros frustrated. At this point, if you haven't bought the market this year, it's not the most prudent thing to do to chase it today. At the same time, being short is frustrating,"" said Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com.
*****
> Redler said he's still long the market, but is hedging because the quick gains have made it riskier. ""The next stop traders are looking at is 2,700 to 2,730 ... next week could be a good week for a pause while [the market] digests the move."" Redler said next week's reports will be important, but the following week will be key with Apple and Amazon.
*****
> Headlines on trade were a positive this past week, including one that the U.S. was considering rolling back tariffs and another that China was offering to ramp up U.S. imports.
*****
> ""We are going to continue to see these headlines until the deadline,"" said Cesar Rojas, Citigroup global economist. Rojas said he expects to see a deal between the U.S. and China by the March 1 deadline, and while all the details may not be ironed out, he does not expect to see more tariffs.
*****
> ""The focus for China is to stabilize its economy. One of the reasons we see a window of opportunity for a trade deal is the growth dynamics for the U.S. and China. We see still growth in the U.S., weakening growth in China for the first half, but for the second half, we see stabilizing growth in China and moderating growth in the U.S.,"" he said. He said the next senior-level talks at the end of the month could be key.
*****
> ""I think you want to watch trade. We have a client survey we do once a quarter, and more than half the investors thought we would not get a trade deal by March 1,"" said Lori Calvasina, head of U.S. equities strategy at RBC Capital Markets. ""I think that's part of the reason the market's been acting better in here. It's not that anything has happened, but you have some nice news, news that's moving in a positive direction.""
*****
> Economic reports in the week ahead will be limited due to the government shutdown, which in itself is a growing risk for markets as economists say it could shave a tenth of a percentage point off GDP growth for each week it continues. Regularly scheduled durable goods will not be available, but there will be existing home sales Tuesday and jobless claims on Thursday, among others.
*****
> For the stock market, earnings will be important, with nearly 60 S&P companies reporting. That includes IBM and Johnson and Johnson on Tuesday; Procter and Gamble and United Technologies Wednesday, and Intel and Starbucks Thursday.
*****
> Financial companies were a mixed bag in the past week, with some high-profile misses such as Morgan Stanley and J.P. Morgan, with its first miss in 15 quarters.
*****
> Earnings growth at this point is expected to be up 14.2 percent, when considering companies that have already reported, according to Refinitiv.
*****
> ""You have to be a little careful at this point. It's very lumpy when you're coming out of the gate sector-by-sector,"" said Calvasina. ""I think the industrials are going to be an important sector. I'm curious to see what's going to happen to them. The margin expectations have been pretty high, and a lot of the sell-side expectations are baking in expansion."" Calvasina said the sector was one of the most vocal last quarter about the impact of tariffs and could have updates on the impact.
*****
> For tech, earnings expectations have been coming down and are now at 2.6 percent growth for the sector in 2019. The lowered expectations for technology companies have trailed the declines in other sectors, such as materials, consumer discretionary and health care, Calvasina said. Overall, the S&P is expected to see earnings growth of 6 percent in 2019, down from more than 23 percent in 2018.
*****
> Even with lowered earnings expectations, technology stocks are not really reflecting the earnings cuts as much as some other sectors. Semiconductors has been a culprit, pulling down the whole group. On a price-to-earnings basis, relative to the market, technology P/Es have been creeping higher, not falling, she said.
*****
> ""The damage to earnings is worse than the damage to the price,"" she said, meaning that the stocks could be vulnerable this earnings season.
*****
> The World Economic Forum begins in Davos, Switzerland, on Sunday. President Donald Trump and Cabinet members are not attending because of the government shutdown.

# The Best and Worst Performing S&P 500 Stocks So Far in 2019

> Below we take a look at the best and worst performing S&P 500 stocks since we turned the corner into the new year. The top stock in the S&P 500 so far YTD is the healthcare play Celgene (CELG). At today’s close, the company finished up an astounding 37.67% year to date. Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR) and Netflix (NFLX) are not far behind up 35.44% and 32.5%, respectively.

> While Health Care and Communication Services stocks make up the top three, the Energy sector is actually the most represented on the list with 11 out of 30 names. Whereas Tech was the poster child for gains for most of last year, there is only a single Technology stock in the top 30, and it’s probably the last one you’d guess — Xerox (XRX).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/best1.png))**

> Taking a look at the other end of the spectrum, with bankruptcy talks dominating the focus of the stock, PG&E (PCG) has fallen 70.91% in just 15 days. Macy’s ranks 2nd with a decline of 16.12%, while Newmont Mining (NEM) ranks 3rd at -10.48%. These are the only three stocks in the index down more than 10% on the year.

> The worst performers have a much larger variation on a sector basis. Health Care, which was another outperformer of 2018, is the only standout with 8 companies represented in the worst 30. The only sectors without a stock making this list are Real Estate, Communication Services, and Energy.

# Typical Pre-Election Year January Trading: Up, Up & Away

> In pre-election years, Januarys have been downright stellar ranking #1 for S&P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 and #2 for DJIA since 1950. Thus far, this January has been adhering to this historical tendency rather well. As of yesterday’s close, Russell 2000 was leading the charge, up nearly 7.2%. NASDAQ was in second place with a gain of 5.9% while DJIA was at the back of the pack at 3.2%.

> Looking at the chart below, comparing past historical average pre-election year January performance with 2019 as of the close on the eleventh trading day (January 15), you can see all five indexes are have produced above average gains throughout most of the month already. You can also see that, on average, the trend from now until the end of the month has been quite positive which suggests further gains are possible.

# High Yield Spreads: When Crashing is a Good Thing

> After screaming higher towards the end of 2018 right up through the first couple of days of 2019, high yield spreads have come crashing back down to earth in the last two weeks, falling from a high of 544 basis points (bps) on 1/3 to 440 bps through Thursday. At their highs two weeks ago, spreads were the widest they have been since the Summer of 2016 and the highest while moving higher since the middle of 2015 when oil prices were crashing.

> In the lower chart, we show the 10-day rate of change of high yield spreads over time. At their peak back on 1/3, spreads had seen the largest 10-day move wider since early 2018 (98 bps). Ten trading days later, we are now looking at the largest narrowing move in spreads since July 2016. Unlike the current period, the narrowing of spreads in July 2016 did not immediately follow a 10-day move where spreads widened significantly. To find a period where this large of a move immediately followed a ten-day period where investors couldn’t exit high yield fast enough (wider spreads), you have to go back to that period in February 2016 that was marked by the ‘Dimon Bottom.” Now, if only the market follows a similar path moving forward!

What's on everyone's radar for today's trading day ahead here at r/wallstreetbets?

"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning March 25th, 2019",24,b4l4dt,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b4l4dt/wall_street_week_ahead_for_the_trading_week/,8,2019-03-23 22:03:06,"Hey what's happening r/wallstreetbets! Good afternoon and happy Saturday to all of you on this subreddit. I hope everyone made out pretty nicely in the market last week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead! :)

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 25th, 2019.

# **Dow drops more than 450 points, S&P 500 posts worst day since January amid global growth worries  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/22/stock-market-wall-street-in-focus-as-growth-concerns-persist.html)**
*****
> Stocks tumbled on Friday as global growth fears and the Federal Reserve's more cautious economic forecast sparked investor angst into the weekend.
*****
> The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank to its session lows heading into the close and finished down 460.19 points at 25,502.32. Bank stocks led the decline thanks to a sharp pullback in long-term Treasury yields. The S&P 500 fell 1.9 percent to 2,800.71, its biggest one-day drop since Jan. 3. The Nasdaq Composite declined 2.5 percent to 7,642.67 as shares of Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Alphabet and Apple all closed lower.
*****
> ""There's a host of worries out there and those worries continue to mount,"" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities. ""The fear of recession is increasing.""
*****
> ""As a result, we have a market that is rethinking some of the optimism that was priced in.""
*****
> Sending bank stocks lower was an inversion of the so-called yield curve. The spread between the 3-month Treasury bill yield and the 10-year note rate turned negative for the first time since 2007, thus inverting the curve. An inverted yield curve occurs when short-term rates surpass their longer-term counterparts, putting a damper bank lending profits. An inverted curve is also considered a recession indicator.
*****
> Citigroup fell more than 4 percent. Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, J.P. Morgan Chase and Bank of America all declined at least 2.9 percent.
*****
> Friday's moves come after Fed surprised investors by adopting a sharp dovish stance on Wednesday, projecting no further interest rate hikes this year and ending its balance sheet roll-off. Though investors often dislike higher borrowing costs and rate hikes, the motivation for the central bank's restraint rekindled worries of a GDP growth slowdown. The Fed justified its more temperate outlook by cutting its U.S. economic growth outlook for 2019.
*****
> ""Maybe one should think about the global economy and not pin everything on the Fed,"" Jeffrey Gundlach, CEO of Doubleline Capital, told CNBC's Scott Wapner. ""Except the Fed should operate in consideration of global conditions too.""
*****
> Friday saw more weak economic data from around the world that stoked those fears.
*****
> IHS Markit said manufacturing activity in Germany dropped to its lowest level in more than six years in March. In France, manufacturing and services slowed down to their lowest levels in three months and two months, respectively. For the euro zone as a whole, manufacturing fell to its lowest level since April 2013. These data sent the German 10-year bund yield briefly into negative territory, its lowest level since 2016.
*****
> ""The indicators are stacking up to suggest that this is not a 2021 phenomenon, that we could actually see the possibility of a recession starting maybe later this year,"" Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, told CNBC's ""Closing Bell.""
*****
> Nike also weighed on the market throughout Friday's session. The athletic apparel company's stock fell 6.6 percent on the back of weak quarterly sales growth in North America. Boeing shares dropped 2.8 percent after Indonesian airline Garuda canceled a $6 billion order for 49 Boeing 737 Max jets.
*****
> Despite the decline on Friday, stocks were still up sharply for the year. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq are up 11.7 percent and 15.2 percent, respectively. The Dow, meanwhile, has rallied 9.2 percent.
*****
> ""Let's not lose sight of the fact that we've had a nice rally over the last couple of weeks,"" said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade. ""Today is not a great day, but after a strong week or two you tend to get a bit of a sell-off.""
*****
> ""Now, should you be cautious? Absolutely, because the slowdown worldwide is something people need to be cautious about.""

# Watch Out For End of March/Q1 Weakness

> March markets have been rather turbulent in recent years with weakness historically later in the month, taking some mean end-of-quarter hits as fund managers often partake in quarterly window dressing and portfolio restructuring. After the big gains we logged in January and February choppy market action is not surprising, especially with the backdrop of the ongoing China trade and Brexit deal delays and what appears to be the end of the Fed tightening cycle for now. Boeing’s woes and U.S. political infighting have not helped either.

> But as you can see in the chart of the recent history of typical March trading patterns with 2019 performance overlaid in dotted lines, action so far this month has not been all that unusual. With that in mind we are ever leery of another end-of-March hit.

# April Almanac: DJIA’s Best Month

> April marks the end of our “Best Six Months” for DJIA and the S&P 500. On April 1st, we will begin looking for our seasonal MACD sell signal and corresponding early signs of seasonal weakness. Even in historically strong pre-election years the “Worst Six Months” have been lackluster on average. 

> April 1999 was the first month to gain 1000 DJIA points. However, from 2000 to 2005, “Tax” month was hit, declining in four of six years. Since 2006, April has been up thirteen years in a row with an average gain of 2.3% to reclaim its position as the best DJIA month since 1950. April is third best for S&P and fourth best for NASDAQ (since 1971).

> The first half of April used to outperform the second half, but since 1994 that has no longer been the case. The effect of April 15 Tax Deadline appears to be diminished with numerous bullish days present on either side of the day. Traders and investors are clearly focused on first quarter earnings and guidance during April. Exceptional Q1 earnings and positive surprises tend to be anticipated with stocks and the market moving up in advance of the announcements and consolidating or correcting afterwards.

> Typical pre-election year strength does bolster April’s performance since 1950. April is DJIA’s best month in pre-election years (+4.0%), second best for S&P 500 (+3.5%) and third best for NASDAQ (+3.5%). Small caps measured by the Russell 2000 also perform well with gains (+2.8%) in seven of ten pre-election year April’s since 1979.

# Russell Falls Apart

> While the rest of the market was rallying and holding up, the Russell has been struggling for close to a month now. After peaking above its 50-DMA back on 2/25, the Russell has had a hard time holding onto any gains lately. Earlier this week it made a lower high when the rest of the market was making higher highs, and to close out the week, it declined 3.6% for its worst day of 2019, making a lower low. Not a pretty chart at all.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/032219-Ruh-Roh.png))**

> The Russell’s underperformance can really be seen in the ratio of the Nasdaq to the Russell 2000. This week, the ratio between the two really become unglued, topping 5 for the first time since February 2001.

> On a longer-term basis, the only time the Nasdaq has been outperforming the Russell 2000 by such a wide margin was during the period from November 1998 through February 2001. And if you think the ratio is extreme now, during that period it got as high as 8.64 on March 28, 2000. In order for the ratio to get to that sort of extreme now, the Nasdaq would need to top 13,000 (assuming the Russell remained at the same level).

# Yield Curve, Yield Curve, Yield Curve

> If you are anything else besides the yield curve today, the market doesn’t care. After inverting for the first time since 2007 earlier today, the spread between the yields on the 10-year and 3-month US Treasuries has sucked up all the oxygen in the room as investors, traders, and their algos fret over the ominous economic signal that an inverted yield curve historically implies. Who cares whether the onset of a recession usually comes several months or even a couple of years after the curve first inverts; investors are using this as an excuse to take profits, and take profits is what they’re doing.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/032219-YCa.png))**

> Just to illustrate how captivating the yield curve has been to the equity market, check out an intraday chart of S&P 500 futures versus the yield curve since very early this morning. Moves in the yield curve are clearly leading equities. When the curve started flattening early this morning, equities started heading south with the pace of selling accelerating when the curve inverted. Then, as the curve made its intraday low right after noon, the low in equities followed less than 40 minutes later. It’s like the school playground, where the yield curve is the ‘cool kid’ and equities are the followers.

# Stocks Feeling Sensitive

> Investors are wondering what the right number is for the market as stocks leg lower on bad global data to close the week. Without taking a view on what the “right” price for the S&P 500 is, below we show a way to organize thinking about valuation in the short-term. In the table below we show a range of EPS growth rates relative to 2018 and a range of multiples on the resulting EPS numbers. The result is where the S&P 500 should trade given hypothetical earnings and how those are valued. For example, if you estimate EPS will fall 2% in both 2019 and 2020, and you value those EPS at a multiple of 15.0x, the S&P 500 is almost 700 points above where it should be! Alternatively, if you think EPS will be stable but should be valued at a relatively aggressive 19.0x, the S&P 500 should be trading near 3100. In the grid below, we’ve highlighted ~2800 values (roughly where the S&P 500 sits right now) to show the implicit EPS growth and multiple assumptions embedded in the price. Again, we don’t know the “right” combination of multiples and EPS growth, but if you’re extremely beared up with the Friday drop or think stocks are set to surge thanks to a dovish Fed, this analysis can help you see what sort of assumptions would need to play out for that to happen.

# The Fed on Reserve

> The Federal Reserve (Fed) has doubled down on its patient stance. Policymakers signaled a complete pause in policy at the conclusion of the Fed’s March meeting, with a nod to a slowing pace of growth and global uncertainty.

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, Fed voting members projected (via the latest “dot plot”) unchanged to slightly lower interest rates this year, with one more rate hike in 2020 or later to lift the long-term rate to 2.75%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DOT-Plot-Aligns-with-a-Federal-Reserve-U-Turn.png?ssl=1))**

> Policymakers also lowered their gross domestic product growth projections to 2.1% for 2019 and 1.9% for 2020, while Fed Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged that global weakness could be a notable headwind to the U.S. economy.

> Still, Powell conveyed significant faith in U.S. economic fundamentals, noting in his press conference that “it’s a great time to be patient,” as the labor market remains strong, confidence has improved back to encouraging levels, and the outlook remains positive.

> “Powell and the Fed delivered a balanced message to U.S. investors, indicating that the lack of clarity warrants a patient stance,” said LPL Research Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. “We side with the Fed here in thinking that underlying economic conditions remain solid, with evidence of a slowdown at the beginning of this year from near-term temporary headwinds.”

> Powell hinted that interest rates are in the “broad range” of neutral, or the point where policy is neither accommodative nor restrictive to output. That doesn’t mean that rates have hit a short-term ceiling, though. We wouldn’t be surprised if stabilizing U.S. growth and higher inflation lead to a rate hike in the second half of 2019. The Fed’s current projections give few indications of that happening, likely because of policymakers’ hesitance to pass judgment on the U.S. economy amid mixed signals from data. Because of this, we expect the Fed to carefully communicate any change in stance to investors.

> The Fed also announced it would start reducing the pace of its balance-sheet runoff in May, and end the runoff entirely in September. Powell reiterated that interest rate changes are the Fed’s primary policy tool, but a larger balance sheet could help buoy risk assets and capital investments.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week ahead?

Have a fantastic weekend and a great final trading week of March and Q1 ahead to everyone here on r/wallstreetbets!"
"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning September 30th, 2019",26,dafnjz,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dafnjz/wall_street_week_ahead_for_the_trading_week/,4,2019-09-28 18:28:32,"Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning September 30th, 2019.

# **The third quarter was a dud for stocks, but the fourth quarter could be full of surprises  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/27/fourth-quarter-could-hold-plenty-of-surprises-for-markets.html)**
*****
> The third quarter wraps up in the week ahead with stocks just slightly higher for the period, after a summer of zigzag moves.
*****
> The market faces some of the same challenges in the final quarter of the year, including Brexit, the trade war with China, sluggishness in the global economy and the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump. By mid-quarter, the U.S. presidential election will be just a year away, and it could become a factor that could start to trigger market volatility.
*****
> Stocks were lower in the past week, with the S&P 500 down 1%, finishing at 2,961.
*****
> For the year to date, the S&P 500 is up 18.1%, but in the third quarter, so far, it added just 0.7%. The S&P started the quarter at 2,752, went as high as 3,028 before falling back. It has chopped in a range down to about 2,860, and has repeatedly struggled to get back to its high.
*****
> “We think you stay within the range — 2,820 to 3,030,” said Julian Emanuel, BTIG head equities and derivatives strategist. Emanuel’s year-end target has been 3,000.
*****
> “We see new highs, whether they happen in the fourth quarter or in 2020, as a function of geopolitical developments. From our point of view, the developments of the last several weeks, particularly [Sen. Elizabeth] Warren rising in the polls, increases in our mind the probability you get some sort of deal with China,” he said.
*****
> Analysts said there could be more volatility because of the efforts by House Democrats to impeach Trump. The investigation into the president has to do with his withholding of aid to Ukraine and whether it was tied to a request to get dirt on front running Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.
*****
> Warren, D-Mass., whose tax and other policies are viewed as unfriendly to markets, is catching up with Biden in the polls, and some strategists see her benefiting from any negative news on Hunter Biden’s dealings with a Ukraine gas company. Emanuel said if Warren continues to gain, that may encourage China to move forward with a trade deal with Trump, for fear making a deal with Warren would be more difficult.
*****
> Besides political headlines, there is some key data coming out in the week ahead, including Friday’s September employment report, and ISM and PMI manufacturing data on Tuesday. The economy is expected to have added 145,000 jobs, above the 130,000 last month, while the unemployment rate is expected to stay steady at 3.7%, according to Refinitiv.
*****
> “We expect another month of census-related hiring to push public sector payrolls higher and, as a result, we forecast only 120k increase in private sector payrolls,” notes Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Barclays. “Our forecast for private sector employment gains in September would represent some improvement relative to August, but our forecast overall remains consistent with our outlook for slower employment growth on the heels of deceleration in economic activity.”

> There are also a number of Fed speakers scheduled for next week, including New York Fed President John Williams; Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester, and Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren.
*****
> Trade will remain a major topic for markets, as U.S. and Chinese negotiators get closer to Oct. 10 talks. Headlines Friday that the White House is considering blocking or limiting U.S. investments into China sent stocks lower, after optimism about the talks lifted them early in the day.
*****
> Emanuel said the fourth quarter may have a different tone from that of the third quarter, after the wild move lower in rates during August and early September. He expects bond yields have bottomed, and he favors some of the cyclical names, like financials and energy.
*****
> “The likelihood is long-term yields move higher, and you could see some form of switching out of bond exposure and into stock exposure. That type of embracing of the stock market is typical of final innings,” for markets, he said.
*****
> Strategists said the impeachment efforts against Trump may ultimately not have a negative impact on stocks. Even if he is impeached by the House, the Senate would be expected to acquit him. Analysts liken the possible reaction to be more like when President Bill Clinton was impeached and acquitted by the Senate than when President Richard Nixon was facing impeachment proceedings. Nixon resigned before he was impeached.
*****
> Stocks gained 28% in the year after impeachment efforts began against Clinton, but lost 39% in the year after they were begun against Nixon.
*****
> Emanuel said the 2020 presidential election could also come into play this quarter, and Trump may take actions to boost the economy, such as finding a solution to the trade war with China. A resolution could give a boost to stocks.
*****
> “People are very nervous and in general reasonably well-hedged because they remember the fourth quarter of last year so well, and from our point of view, we don’t necessarily see this trading range resolve itself any time soon,” said Emanuel.
*****
> Markets will also be watching the Fed’s repo operation Monday. The Fed has been conducting open market operations to assure there is enough cash in the short-term funding market, which was under stress at the start of last week. The Fed has calmed the market, but market pros are watching to see how much activity there is and whether rates rise. The final day of the month typically sees a surge in cash requirements, and on Monday, investors may require cash for the settlement of $113 billion in Treasury securities.

# October’s First Trading Day Mixed Over Last 21 years

> Based upon data in the soon to be available Stock Trader’s Almanac for 2020 on page 88, the first trading day of October is DJIA’s fourth weakest of all monthly first trading days since September 1997 based upon total DJIA points gained. June, August and September have been weaker. S&P 500 has been down 10 of the last 21 years on the first trading day of October. DJIA’s record is slightly softer with 11 declines and NASDAQ’s performance has been the worst of the group, down 12 times with an average loss of 0.36%.

# Fruitful to Sell Rosh Hashanah

> Happy Jewish New Year to you all! I took the above picture of pomegranates last year in Tel Aviv’s Carmel Market during my adventure through Israel with my family in celebration of my eldest son’s bar mitzvah.

> As the High Holidays approach you may remember the old saying on the Street, “Sell Rosh Hashanah, Buy Yom Kippur.” It gets tossed around every autumn when the “high holidays” are on the minds of traders as many of their Jewish colleagues take off to observe the Jewish New Year and Day of Atonement.

> The basis for this, “Sell Rosh Hashanah, Buy Yom Kippur,” pattern is that with many traders and investors busy with religious observance and family, positions are closed out and volume fades creating a buying vacuum. Even in the age of algorithmic, computer, and high frequency trading these seasonal patterns persist as humans still need to turn the machines on and off and feed them money or take it away – and these algorithms and trading programs are written by people so the human influence is still there.

> Holiday seasonality around official market holidays is something we pay close attention to (page 88 Stock Trader’s Almanac). Actual stats on the most observed Hebrew holidays have been compiled in the table here. We present the data back to 1971 and when the holiday falls on a weekend the prior market close is used. It’s no coincidence that Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur fall in September and/or October, two dangerous and sometimes opportune months.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/64f4f19e19c5f8d9bb768316134c46af/9ac6dde39074b5e0-62/s640x960/be7a91356b29ad1cdc61cb6e117a0a05e2127cd3.jpg))**

> Perhaps it’s Talmudic wisdom but, selling stocks before the eight-day span of the high holidays has avoided many declines, especially during uncertain times. While being long Yom Kippur to Passover has produced 59% more advances, half as many losses and average gains of 7.0%.

> This year the high holidays commence on Sunday eve, September 29, and end October 9 with Yom Kippur right in time for Octoberphobia. The current news flow already has folks selling ahead of the Jewish High Holidays, setting up the market for further declines in notoriously volatile October.

*****

# What If September Is Up?

> Well, when the worst month of the year is up, it’s not so bad. October is slightly better when September is up. But Q4 and the rest of the year are generally more positive. In the tables below September is ranked by largest gain for DJIA and S&P 500 since 1949 and NASDAQ since 1971. Q4 remains about average, but full year gains are above average. So if September can eke out a gain then watch out for Octoberphobia, but fear not the full year.

# Financials Hold on to Broad Gains in September

> In spite of the relative weakness we have seen in equities over the last week, US stocks are still poised to finish off September and the entirety of Q3 in the black. While overall breadth among industries was more positive several days ago, there are still four sectors where every industry is still in the black on a month to date basis. As shown in the graphic below, all of the industries within the Energy, Financials, Real Estate, and Utilities sectors remain in the black for the month of September. To be fair, Energy and Real Estate each only have two industries in their respective sectors, so for these two sectors, it isn't quite as impressive. Within the Financials sector, though, all five are still up on the month while all three industries in the Utilities sector are also up MTD.

> In the Energy sector, even with this month's gains of over 4%, both industries in the sector are poised to finish Q3 with a decline. Utilities have been big winners so far this quarter, but Electric Utilities have been the clear leader with an eye-popping gain of 10.2% this quarter.

# Looking for Action? S&P 1500 Most Volatile Stocks

> For traders with a short-term time horizon who are looking for big moves, we have updated our list of the S&P 1500 stocks trading above $10 that have the largest intraday high-low ranges (based on the average percent spread between the intraday high and low over the last 50 days). The stocks are grouped based on whether they have a rising or falling 50-day moving average (DMA).

> While the VIX remains relatively low, in recent months we have started to see some big moves in individual stocks and that can be seen in the fact that a number of stocks in the table below currently have average intraday ranges of more than 5%. The most volatile stock in the S&P 1500 is Lennox International (LII), which has had an average intraday high-low range of 9.5% over the last 50 trading days. Granted, it's only an $11 stock, so the 9.5% average range works out to just about a dollar per day, but it is still volatile nonetheless. Behind LII, there are another three stocks with average daily moves of over 8%, but here again, they are all relatively low priced stocks trading at less than $20 per share. The highest-priced stock on the current list is Innovative Industrial Properties (IIPR). With a share price of $91 and an average daily move of over 5%, IIPR typically sees an intraday swing of over $5. That's a trader's dream if you trade it right, but a nightmare if you get it wrong!

> In terms of sector representation on this month's list, Consumer Discretionary is the most prevalent with 17 different stocks. Behind Discretionary, the next closest sector is Energy at eleven. Finally, with regards to the breakdown between stocks with rising and falling moving averages, there are modestly more stocks with falling moving averages (29) than rising moving averages (21), suggesting some underlying weakness even with the broader S&P 500 trading not far from new highs.

# Manufacturing: Doing Okay or In Collapse? It Depends Who You Ask.

> Last night in The Closer, we discussed the huge divergence between regional Fed manufacturing activity indices and the ISM Manufacturing Index. In the chart below, we've created a proxy for the ISM Manufacturing Index by averaging sub-indices from various regional Fed manufacturing surveys. The result is generally well-correlated to ISM, but over the last few months the two have diverged wildly. While the Five Fed indices from the New York, Philadelphia, and Richmond Fed districts would indicate an ISM reading in the mid-50s, the actual readings have been deteriorating dramatically. Of course, these three Fed districts are a relatively small snapshot of the overall national economy, but collectively their sample size is similar to the ISM's. It's hard to say which is ""right"", but the huge divergence is certainly noteworthy.

Significant Insider Trading Activity (Last 7 Days),14,cu3mwk,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cu3mwk/significant_insider_trading_activity_last_7_days/,5,2019-08-23 02:33:41,"This is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.
The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.
In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information
that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,
insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good
track record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.

~~Take the sentiments with a grain of salt. I get them from NASDAQ and SA, but anyone can press the BULL/BEAR button and effect the sentiment. When I put ""??"" it means there weren't enough reviews to determine BULL/BEAR.~~

I've decided to take out sentiments from now on as they are completely unrelated to ERs and can also be very inaccurate. 9/10 it jut says BULL, even for companies that are flat out dying.
