Initiative Machines (LUNR) awarded NASA contract with max potential value of $4.82 billion!,1644,1fja7bm,https://investors.intuitivemachines.com/news-releases/news-release-details/nasa-awards-intuitive-machines-near-space-network-contract,453,2024-09-18 02:10:00,

Bunch of big nasa heads formed the company seeing how space is going to be privatized. Massive potential with IM2 lander, lunar rover (1 of 3 companies in final design stage for contract), and lunar satellites. Their stock tanked after their first lander tipped over due to them forgetting to remove a landing laser safety. That is an error, but you can bet it will never happen again. They were also first to land on the moon in decades. China pressure will increase lunar budget within gov. 

I don't want to dox myself too much but I'm an engineer and all of their calls and interviews sound like they really fuckin know what they're doing. 

Here is the ceo:
Mr. Altemus is co-founder, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Intuitive Machines. Before founding Intuitive Machines in December 2012, Mr. Altemus was appointed to serve as the Deputy Director of NASA’s Johnson Space Center, a position he held until June 2013. Formerly Director of Engineering from July 2006 to December 2012, Mr. Altemus served as the leader and steward of Johnson Space Center’s engineering capabilities in support of NASA’s human spaceflight programs, projects, and technology activities. Mr. Altemus is also a director of Intuitive Aviation, a subsidiary of Intuitive Machines. Mr. Altemus received a B.S. in Aeronautical Engineering from Embry Riddle Aeronautical University, where he now serves as a member of the Engineering Advisory Board, and an M.S. in Engineering Management from the University of Central Florida. He joined NASA’s Kennedy Space Center and the Space Shuttle Program in 1989, where he held progressively more responsible positions working in Space Shuttle operations, launch, and landing activities. He served as the Columbia Reconstruction Director after the loss of the Space Shuttle Columbia on February 1, 2003. In January 2005, he joined Johnson Space Center, serving as the Deputy Director of Engineering, and was subsequently selected as Director in July 2006. Mr. Altemus is an award-winning engineer and leader. He has been presented with the Federal Engineer of the Year award from the National Society of Professional Engineers, Distinguished Alumni Award from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, and Johnson Space Center’s Engineering Legacy Award.


Q: (from u/LittleWhite0nRice)
You seem really knowledgeable on this industry. I've done a lot of DD on them and they seem great. But my question is: what's their future outlook for expansion? It seems like most space exploration companies are private and won't use LUNR so their consumer is NASA which can be defunded easily. Why keep spending money going to the moon? 

A:
Lander missions and rover are the short term. Lunar satellites are the long term. Providing *the* communications network for lunar truckstop to Mars is a pretty sci fi concept but thats how they'd go from 1-off missions and a market cap of $500M to something in the double digit $B. This plan is already in action- ""The [IM3] mission is also scheduled to carry a data relay satellite, Khon2, which it will deploy to travel to the L2 Earth-Moon libration point. The mission can also carry approximately 1000 kg of secondary payloads to lunar transfer orbit."" This is currently scheduled for Oct 25.

Positions- Shares, 2, 5, and 10 dollar calls spread between Jan '24 into 2025.

TLDR: LUNR is legit. WSB effect could create a squeeze, but I am in long term. I don't think there is a need to FOMO and get it right now, if there is a spike from WSB, you can wait for goldfish brains here to lose focus and for it to come down a bit and get in October or November."

However, I never heard about the lunar landing until last week. 

From what it seems by all the arguments on Reddit, this was also the case for a lot of other people. If you were someone who bought LUNR back when it was at $5, how did you hear about it? 

I saw it pop up as a stock on my screener a while back but it was just one of many available in a huge lists of stocks that rose a little (I only remember seeing it because I liked its name). I don’t research every penny stock that rises, though. 

So, like I said earlier…for those of you who got into LUNR extremely early, how did you know to buy it over a week ago? Do you guys actually research the majority of penny stocks? Are you SpaceX fans who closely follow every space mission? Did you see it pop up as a stock in a scanner and randomly looked into it; you randomly researched it and noticed it was going to be part of a landing mission in the near future?

Those of us who didn’t see it until late last week would like to know how the smart individuals knew in advance. Please share some of your wisdom with us!

Intuitive Machines is competing for NASA's Near Space Network Services (NSNS) contract. Here are the key details about this contract:  
Contract Overview  
The NSNS contract aims to provide communications services for missions operating within 2 million kilometers of Earth, including on and around the moon. It's part of NASA's efforts to establish infrastructure for lunar and deep space exploration.  
Contract Structure  
The NSNS contract is divided into two separate awards:  
Direct-to-Earth communications  
Relay services  
Timeline and Value  
The award for the NSNS contract was expected to be announced in August or September 2024.  
While the exact value hasn't been disclosed, it's considered a significant opportunity for the winning company.  
Intuitive Machines' Position  
Intuitive Machines believes it is uniquely positioned to win this contract due to several factors:  
Their successful IM-1 mission, which marked a significant U.S. lunar landing.  
Their experience in providing lunar data services.  
Their capability to deliver orbiting lunar data satellites.  
Potential Impact  
Winning this contract would be a major milestone for Intuitive Machines, as it would:  
Strengthen their position in the lunar exploration market.  
Provide a significant boost to their revenue and backlog.

Full article, quick read. 👇 https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/15/private-company-shoots-for-first-us-moon-landing-in-more-than-50-years

For those that can't spare 3 minutes to read, a couple of VERY important cliffnotes from the article:

- The lunar lander took off this past Wednesday for the moon in a bid to make the first United States landing since the Apollo missions more than half a century ago. If successful, it will be the first moon landing achieved by a privately owned spacecraft, (Science geeks definitely grabbed the vaseline this week),

- Only the US, Russia, China, India and Japan have EVER achieved a lunar landing; Absolutely no private business has done this ($LUNR would be 1 of 1),

- NASA is paying Intuitive Machines $118M to get its latest set of experiments to the moon (If they're successful, more $$$ and contracts will follow)

The landing is set to happen on the 22nd of February and it will be all over media outlets while Elon Musk tweets about it so he can avoid talking about $TSLA

Intuitive Machines is a company at the forefront of space exploration. The stock ($LUNR) closed below $7.50 today and the warrants are just over a $1 ($LUNRW). 

Depending upon the reception, I'll write up a dedicated bull and bear case before Tuesday. 

It's a long weekend. Buy a ticket to the moon and thank me later. If you're not gonna strap in, fight me in the comments."

The co-founders of Intuitive Machines ($LUNR) are Stephen Altemus, a NASA veteran and engineer by training, Timothy Crain, a NASA veteran engineer as well, and Kam Ghaffarian, a serial entrepreneur with NASA roots who sold his first business to KBR for over $350M almost six years ago to the day. They all co-founded the company back in 2013. 

Ghaffarian has also co-founded several other companies that are still currently operating. One company is focused on private space missions and plans to build the first private space station – maybe I’ll do a write-up on all of his ownership holdings if an acquisition of $LUNR ends up being on the horizon.

**Here’s an “****APPROXIMATE****” breakdown of ownership of the company:**

\- Stephen Altemus, Tim Crain (CTO of $LUNR), and Kam Ghaffarian, own somewhere between **45 - 70%** of the company,

\- Citadel has around a **5%** or less stake in the company

\- The CEO of the SPAC vehicle that took them public is still invested at a **\~5%** stake

\- Other investors include Armistice Capital, UPENN, and LMR Partners

[https://whalewisdom.com/stock/ipax](https://whalewisdom.com/stock/ipax) 

It’s difficult to get a precise calculation on ownership due to financial reporting lags relative to share movement (*e.g., stock awards, “transfers out”, etc.)* that occurred within the company over the last year, so I used a combination of publicly available holdings statistics paired w/ the most recent 13G schedules to try and derive estimates on ownership stakes but admittedly, it’s hard to do when a number of sites are reporting net changes for institutions and individuals at different time periods. 

What is clear is that the three founders are very keen on keeping control of the company in the near term and no institution owns a more than **19%** stake in the firm at present. There may be some management selling in the near-term if the stock outperforms, but a greater than **50%** combined ownership stake signals to me that they either want to hold long-term or sell big at some point in the future (*via acquisition or if the stock performs significantly well*). 

Citadel owns somewhere between **2%** and **5%** of the shares outstanding and yes, this is the notorious Citadel Hedge Fund that was embroiled with the Robinhood saga a few years back. Take what you will from that, but Ken Griffin is a respected Wall-Street veteran and industry titan. He also has his own small personal stake in the company and this does mean something despite him being a billionaire cartoon villain.

Michael Blitzer, who has been the CEO of Inflection Point Acquisition Corp. since February 2021, remains a key shareholder (**\~5%**) after completion of its business combination with Intuitive Machines last February. 

My biggest takeaway from looking at transactions in $LUNR post their de-spac in 2023 was that there appears to only have been 3 sales since 2023 – and they all appear to have been private sales. In over a year, the number of insiders who have sold shares is surprisingly less than 3.  

[https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/LUNR/insider-trades](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/LUNR/insider-trades) 

There you have it. **TLCR:** Founders still own a ton of shares, Citadel is invested - Ken Griffin personally, a couple of notable funds are invested including a venerable collegiate institution, and the CEO of the SPAC who brought them to market is still invested. 

At the opening bell tomorrow, choose a side; either way, it’s gonna be a very interesting ride."

Here is why LUNR spiked today ,54,1f8ax08,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1f8ax08/here_is_why_lunr_spiked_today/,27,2024-09-04 02:19:23,"I have had some LUNR calls and was shocked when I saw LUNR start rising unexpectedly, especially during this red day. My initial assumption was that some insiders got the news that LUNR was given the NSNS contract from NASA and artificially lowered the price of the stock so they could buy at a low and then sell when the news was released. However, my assumptions were false and the spike today was due to a collaboration with Imagine Dragons and Bethesda.

""Imagine Dragons will also team up with Bethesda Games Studio, for a live debut of their track, “Children of the Sky (A Starfield Song).” Additionally, the track “will be transmitted back to Earth from the surface of the Moon as part of Lonestar’s Freedom Mission flying with Intuitive Machines to the South Lunar Pole in early 2025,” per a release""

This with NSNS contract news that can drop any day now will most likely increase LUNR stock to unseen heights. In addition, I think space stocks are going to be the new A.I. stock in the coming years because both political candidates support space travel and expansion. Furthermore, when the Artemis II goes off it will generate public awareness (Manned flyby missions) which could mean more investments into space.  Artemis II is expected to launch in September 2025 so a lot of time to start investing. Lastly, Artemis III will launch in September 2026 and it will be the first crewed landing since Apollo 17. Apollo 11 had 650 million viewers so imagine how much viewership Artemis III will bring especially when more people will have access to watch it and the fact we have not stepped on the moon like 50 years.

Millions in contracts already with NASA, lots of growth and future potential. Great team and leadership. Competing with multiple other large scale defense contractors and supplies countless valuable technologies for space missions and exploration. Just won a contract to oversee other clear defense contractors while building a lunar rover for NASA. Probably a lot more contract announcements to come. 

I may be regarded, but analysts are wayyy below the PT with most estimating $10-$15. This thing is going to hit $40 or higher in the next few months just before they launch another moon mission in Q4 of the calendar year. Their last launch was basically successful, so the next one definitely will be.

The CEO of LUNR will be speaking on CNBC later today where they may announce some big news. Trust me, this stock is the biggest win for commercial space exploration anyone has ever seen since SpaceX, and backed by a couple billionaires that actually have a brain.

LUNR “BASED” DD,66,1av2fo7,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1av2fo7/lunr_based_dd/,57,2024-02-20 05:03:43,"**Preface:** I am not an astrophysicist, nor am I an acoustic space nerd. This is my first space stock. I am fairly new to investing in general. This is DEFINITELY not financial advice. I’m sure this will be highly regarded going forward…

Intuitive Machines symbol LUNR has launched Nova-C to deliver payloads to the moon. This will be the first moon landing completed by america in over 50 years and as far as I know, the first moon landing completed by a private company. The Nova-C is only a day away from being in the moon's orbit and about two days away from landing. The success in the landing will be a monumental moment for this company, but also incredibly pivotal. This will be revolutionary for the commercialization of space and the Nova-C is just the beginning. With goals of delivering payloads and eventually retrieving precious materials from space, this company clearly has a strong future. For more general information and more technical DD reference this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/1atnihy/the\_value\_of\_lunr\_and\_why\_it\_could\_spike\_up\_500/](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/1atnihy/the_value_of_lunr_and_why_it_could_spike_up_500/)

**Will it Fail?:** I was nervous to bet on the launch because we’ve seen countless failed launches, but how many failed landings have you seen? We haven't landed on the moon in awhile, but we have never failed an actual landing. Now, to be fair, we’ve had failed moon missions because of technical difficulties in the spacecraft that occurred BEFORE the actual landing. Such as [Apollo 13](https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/lunar/ap13acc.html#:~:text=The%20Apollo%2013%20malfunction%20was,it%20to%20lose%20oxygen%20rapidly.) or Intuitive Machines leading competitor, [Astrobotics, recent failure because of a fuel leak/Native American Curse](https://apnews.com/article/moon-landing-launch-private-nasa-0987b31b201b78c3935f1bfbf9a7cade) (more on that later). When have we ever failed a landing on the ISS? Never. Now again, I am not talking about missions being aborted before attempting touch down, I am talking about the literal moment of landing, which at this point is really all that’s left for the Nova-C. We have never failed this. (If we have someone please send me a source, most of this information was gathered in about 30 minutes.)

Is there still a chance we fail the landing? Of course. Are the chances of failing lower than ever? Yes. Our technology for trajectory and directional control in space has been stable for a long time, breaking out of the atmosphere is the hard part, the landing is straightforward. Especially for this company! They SPECIALIZE in accurate landings. Bard said this, “Intuitive Machines: Uses Nova-C, a single-stage lander designed for precise lunar landings and delivering payloads. They leverage existing technologies and partner with other companies for specific needs.” They're landing tech is perfected beyond belief, just look at this [inspiring animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYK5n6fcnyc).[ ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYK5n6fcnyc)

On this current mission they are set to deliver [5 NASA payloads](https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=IM-1-NOVA). That means, fucking NASA, trusts this company to handle their billion dollar instruments, instead of just delivering it themselves. Apparently it's cheaper for NASA to deliver this way, but either way that is a lot of trust. THIS company will be responsible for aLL commercial payloads going forward. They will have a monopoly on delivering custom contracted research equipment and other payloads to space. Here are all the payloads the Nova-C is carrying:

&#x200B;

[Current Update: Nova-C is expected to be in the moon’s orbit by the 21st. They plan on announcing the time of the landing tomorrow, the 20th. They are currently looking to land sometime in the afternoon on February 22nd and will be live streaming the event on their website.](https://preview.redd.it/xjwy342mmmjc1.png?width=646&format=png&auto=webp&s=5efed552c58b4831c4756efec759ae2eda004954)

I’m planning on purchasing 1000 or so shares tomorrow, I will post a screenshot when I do.

**“Astrobotic drummed up its own freight business, packing the 6-foot-tall (1.9-meter-tall) Peregrine lander. On board the lander: a chip of rock from Mount Everest, toy-size cars from Mexico and ashes and DNA of deceased space enthusiasts, including “Star Trek” creator Gene Roddenberry and science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke.**

**The Navajo Nation recently sought to have the launch delayed because of the human remains. saying it would be a “profound desecration” of a celestial body revered by Native Americans. Astrobotic chief executive John Thornton said the December objections came too late but promised to try to find “a good path forward” with the Navajo for future missions.”**

Nova-C clearly has god on their side, but do they also have anime? We’ll see…

Since learning about the Intuitive Machines mission to the moon, I've been very bullish regarding the stock for LUNR. If you have not invested in this stock, you might want to give it a look today since they are about to make history. Here are my top 10 reasons why you should consider LUNR or LUNRW.

Background: IM-1 is the second US-based Commercial Lunar Payload Services lander mission since Apollo 17 on December 11, 1972.

The first mission was Peregrine Mission One by Astrobotic Technology, Inc. The mission launched on January 8, 2024, and just hours after launch, the Astrobotics team confirmed the mission was in jeopardy. They identified issues with orienting the spacecraft for charging the batteries and a propellant leak. With the unsolvable propellant leak, the Astrobotics team abandoned the mission and performed a controlled re-entry over the South Pacific on January 18th under the advisement of NASA and the space community. Peregrine Mission One never left Earth orbit.

IM-1 Mission Facts

1. First Commercial Lunar Payload Services mission to launch using a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. \[February 15, 2024\]
2. Successfully fired the first liquid methane and liquid oxygen engine in space. \[February 16, 2024\]
3. First US-based mission to successfully leave Earth orbit (successful trans-lunar insertion). \[February 15, 2024\]
4. First Commercial Lunar Payload Services mission to successfully transmit images to Earth during its transfer orbit. \[February 16, 2024\]
5. Completed two trajectory correction maneuvers. The second burn was completed with enough precision to eliminate needing a third burn. \[February 20, 2024\]
6. First US-based mission to successfully enter Lunar orbit (successful lunar orbit insertion). \[February 21, 2024\]
7. The mission is making international headlines across multiple news outlets after successfully orbiting the moon. \[February 21, 2024\]
8. The mission managers and flight controllers have done an excellent job handling this mission's guidance, navigation, and control. After lunar orbit insertion, they performed corrective burns to optimize overall efficiency and improve the estimated landing time twice, from 16:30 CT to 15:26 CT. \[February 22, 2024\]
9. The stock has shown a significant improvement after the most recent update from Intuitive Machines, which provided an earlier-than-expected landing time for the second time. Rising 12.25% from $8.99 to $10.11 within 1 hour and 23 minutes. Currently, the stock is trending near $9.00/share as of 3:00 PM ET. \[February 22, 2024\]
10. Intuitive Machines is an American-based company based in Houston, TX. Do you need any more persuasion other than investing in an American company that is just hours away from landing on the moon?"

I am talking about something that does not make any sense, the whole industry gets inflated to preposterous levels because of a general euphoria for the industry no matter how shitty their product or business model is (NIO, Rivian, SMCI etc…). 

And we have seen the enthusiasm surrounding $LUNR achievements this past week, the stock went from ≈$2 to ≈$11 in a few weeks ! 

Now imagine when we are going to land actual people onto the moon. Imagine how excited mainstream media is going to be, how excited we are all going to be here on this future easy short that we call Reddit ! 

Everybody will be talking about space, from your wife’s boyfriend to your friends who hate you to your alcoholic father. The astronauts will become stars like Buzz Aldrin & Neil Armstrong & whoever the third guy was back in the day. 

We are still a bit far from launch date but this industry is about to explode and it’s time to load the boat. 

SpaceX will IPO during this time as the excitement will be at an ATH and Elon Muskito nows that. 

What’s the next best thing ? Rocket. Fucking. Lab. 

I am all in $RKLB as they won’t shit the bed like $LUNR did and will one day also offer crewed missions. They are the only reliable company other than SpaceX in this space, they are the only ones flawlessly executing.

Intuitive Machines (LUNR) - Space exploration company undergoing a major financial recovery,21,1bdaktg,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bdaktg/intuitive_machines_lunr_space_exploration_company/,36,2024-03-13 03:54:17,"**Intuitive Machines (LUNR)** designs, manufactures, and operates space products and services in the US. Its space systems and space infrastructure enable scientific and human exploration and utilization of lunar resources to support sustainable human presence on the moon. The company offers µNova, a lunar rocket-fueled drone, lunar surface rover services, fixed lunar surface services, rideshare delivery services, lunar access services, lunar orbit delivery services, and lunar data network services, as well as content sales and marketing. It also offers aerospace engineering services to **NASA** and the aerospace industry.  


LUNR is currently holding over the $5 a share level ($11 last month), having spiked above $40 a share upon its listing in February 2023.  


What I quickly noticed during my initial research is that they blew past Q2 and Q3 earnings estimates, as shown below (EPS in dollars). This equated to net income of $30mn and $34mn, respectively.  


https://preview.redd.it/xhu3leypaznc1.png?width=696&format=png&auto=webp&s=7784ac316c15c86abced2f5a28fd3858c1763bac

What was the biggest red flag to me (but please read to the end) is that its total liabilities in Q3 2023 stand at $422mn, compared to total assets of $103mn. They are very debt heavy. BUT in the space of 6 months from May - September 2023, they reduced total liabilities from $957mn to $422mn.  


If the firm can keep positive cashflow, then at this rate they could have a healthy balance sheet within the year. Total cash levels currently sit at $41mn.  


https://preview.redd.it/trhru0puaznc1.png?width=694&format=png&auto=webp&s=03426828b6df5ecee4cbcf0888d7e477d1320193

LUNR report their Q4 2023 results on **21 March 2024**. Another big earnings beat and a continued reduction in total liabilities will provide a huge green light to investors. The federal reserve interest rate cuts will also spur further debt reductions.  
Short selling activity is currently low according to S&P Global.

A little class for you regardless who don’t know what this pimp life is about ,363,1fbrkvg,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1fbrkvg/a_little_class_for_you_regardless_who_dont_know/,108,2024-09-08 12:12:18,"A little help on what options are for you regards 

I have been reading comments in here and I can’t believe you little dipgards can’t even have one aota of brain to think. Despite that I am here to save you and explain what it is you are exactly buying when you buy options… 

Joe thinks $CHEESE will go up above 5$ soon. Joe however doesn’t want to buy a lot of $CHEESE stock because his money is tied up in $DICK, however he would be willing to buy $CHEESE later if it does go up. 

Joe goes to his friend Jack who owns 100 $CHEESEs and tells him… “hey Jack I will give you 60$ as long as you sell me your $CHEESEs for only 5$ even if it goes above that price up until next Friday. 

Joe paid Jack a *premium* of 60$ or .60 for a call on $CHEESE with a *strike price* of 5$ expiring next Friday. 
BASICALLY Joe is Long Call on $CHEESE. 

Now from Jacks POV: 
Jack has been jacking off like a regard to his $CHEESE which he bought at 2$. Jack thinks… 

“hmm I don’t think $CHEESE will go to 5$ anytime soon, but if it did, 5$ sounds like a good price to pull out and sell it for green money to pay my wife’s boyfriend his rent. 

So now Joe comes along and offers Jack this opportunity to make some extra cash (premium) as long as he keeps his promise to sell it to Joe at 5$ (strike) even if it goes way above that… 

The second Joe went long and offered him the premium, the call contract was created… Joe went long call… and Jack went short call. 

As the exp date comes closer, there is less chance for $CHEESE to moon, so the contract is less worth. This is called Theta 😨! It is good for Jack and bad for Joe.  Joe can now hand off the contract to someone else and sell for less (what some of us do here in WSB) or hold til it expires (what most of us do here in WSB). 

Now a contract covers 100 $CHEESE shares. So if $CHEESE goes to 6$ on expiration date. Joe could basically buy 100 $CHEESE from Jack for 5$ and sell it on the market for 6$. That is a profit of 1$ per share or 100$ total. Because anyone who holds this call could buy from Jack at 5$ and sell for 6$. This option is priced accordingly, meaning the option is worth 100$… this is called *intrinsic value*! wow 🤩.  
If Joe can’t afford to buy 100 shares x5$ each for 500$  to sell for 600$. Joe can simply just sell the contract back to someone who can afford it. Because the option was priced accordingly to its intrinsic value, Joe makes the same amount of money as he would’ve if he had 100 shares, but the option only cost him 60$. He made the same amount of profit with less investment, this is called 🌈*leverage*✨🥳 and we love it here! 

Thank you so much for listening to this! 🤤 im so happy you got to sit through story time and maybe learned about something! Let me know if you want a lesson on puts tomorrow! ✨ 

TLDR: Jack is short call Joe is long call. Whole lotta $CHEESE and $DICK. 

Positions: very berry long $LUNR and a forbidden small cap 2025calls. Will buy OXY

NIO - The fire rises! DD inside,51,1ftci6s,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ftci6s/nio_the_fire_rises_dd_inside/,46,2024-10-01 07:06:05,"I don't know what this sub has against NIO, probably the most guaranteed way to make money right now.

For the record my calls are 7c 10/18. I plan on rolling those into the future though.

Ok, let's start. NIO is still down almost 90% from it's ATH. NIO is not some no name, random company. It's here to stay. Sure it's had problems in the past, but it's trajectory is very similar to Tesla in a way... Where a small company was doubted over mistakes but began to grow rapidly.

1) In 2024, NIO is estimated to deliver approximately 220,000 cars, generating $10 billion in revenue. Assuming no change in monthly deliveries, NIO could reach 240,000 vehicles at 20,000 per month. They are projected to sell 16,000 cars in January and February, then 20,000 per month for the remainder of the year, totaling 232,000 vehicles. FIREFLY, expected to enter the market in January 2025, is assumed to sell 5,000 cars monthly for six months, then 10,000 per month, reaching 90,000 by year-end.

Revenue estimates:

NIO’s average revenue per car is $42,000, based on Q2 data (57,000 vehicles generating $2.4 billion), leading to $10 billion in total revenue for 2024.
Assuming an average price of $27,000 per car (with a 5% sales promotion), could generate $6 billion on 232,000 vehicles.
FIREFLY, at $20,000 per vehicle, would contribute $1.8 billion on 90,000 cars.
Total estimated revenue is around $18 billion. With improving gross margins and potential profitability, a P/S ratio of 3 would be reasonable for NIO, leading to a fair market valuation of $54 billion, or a target share price of $24.5 (based on 2.2 billion shares). These estimates don’t account for global expansion, improved margins, reduced R&D costs, revenue from battery swap stations, or a potential partnership with a major German carmaker to address EU tariffs.

2) **Citi raised Nio's price target to $8.90 from $7 and maintains a Buy rating, current price is $6.68, so that would be a 27% increase from here**, increasing volume estimates through 2026 based on sector trends. The firm also raised Nio’s multiple due to the upcoming Tesla Robotaxi event and Q4 car sales season. Citi sees a near-term catalyst from Golden Week order intake, which could boost confidence in Nio’s Firefly brand if successful.

3) Nio announced it has secured RMB3.3 billion in investment from strategic investors, including Hefei Jianheng, for NIO. Nio will invest RMB10 billion and retain an 88.3% stake, with the remaining 11.7% held by the investors and other shareholders.

4) Capital injection to boost the economy that everyone's been talking about.

Intuitive Machines (LUNR) is:
Already profitable. 
Landed something on the moon (it tripped on a rock, granted, but still!)
NASA contracts, including a bid for the VIPER rover.
Paid off debts.
Cheaper stock.

Rocket labs seems great as well, don't get me wrong, but it's odd to see such fervor over RL when IM is getting overlooked.

"🚢 DD for Huntington Ingalls (HII), an explosively loaded policy profit",44,1f23cp9,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1f23cp9/dd_for_huntington_ingalls_hii_an_explosively/,34,2024-08-27 05:36:45,"First off, full transparency, I really like boats.

Sections
0) BLUF: New congressional policies are going to make $HII go to the moon 🚢🚀🌕
1) Boats are important to the U.S. global supremacy (a short history)
1) The U.S. doesn't like it when people touch its boats
2) The U.S. will probably become a commercial shipping power
3) Huntington Ingalls Industries is already incredibly stable

** Bottom Line Up Front:**Congress is probably about to funnel hundreds of billions of $$ into Huntington Ingalls and General Dynamics to **revitalize the U.S. Navy and build a commercial shipping fleet possibly increasing revenue 10x**. People have put other DDs for $HII's strong financials but this primarily targets huge future growth catalysts.

**The U.S. wants to maintain global supremacy, a short history**
To start the DD off, we have to look at the Bretton Woods Conference. Post WWII, Europe is decimated and the US is essentially the world superpower. It invites the rest of the world leaders to a shack in New Hampshire, locks them in, gets them drunk, and 3 weeks later, out comes the World Bank, IMF, and IBRD. The whole world agrees that the U.S. will be the global economic power and in exchange, the U.S. will maintain freedom of the seas (make sure pirates aren't mean and that cargo ships don't get blown up). To do this, the U.S. Navy stands up a huge navy and asserts dominance over all of the oceans.

Fast forward to 2024, China is doing the same thing. They are expanding their navy (currently 355 warships and growing incredibly fast). They are building economic alliances around the globe and upsetting the global world order. The U.S. has ~290 warships and can only build ~11/yr putting us strongly behind China in naval size. With this disparity in mind, the U.S. is waking up to the fact that countries that previously played nice for the U.S. possibly only did so for protection of maritime trade (90% of traded goods are transported by sea which comes to be 10s of trillions of $).


**The U.S. doesn't like when people touch its boats**
Everybody knows the U.S. doesn't mess around when it comes to boats. The U.S. treats its boats like sovereign territory and if someone hits a U.S. boat they freak out. The U.S. has a bunch of ships parked in the Red Sea that just sit there and shoot Huthi missiles out of the sky with an astonishingly good record. Missiles are getting better though and defense probably isn't perfect. If a missile from the Huthis actually hits a U.S. ship congress will probably go bonkers at the idea that if some guys in a Hilux can blow up a U.S. warship, China and Russia definitely can. Congress will dump $$$$$$ into modernizing the U.S. Navy and realize that there are only two actual companies that can produce warships in the U.S.; Huntington Ingalls Industries ($HII) and General Dynamics ($GD). In addition, these two build ships at an incredibly slow rate and have low capacity. The U.S. not wanting to lose to anybody will have no choice but to dump an incredible amount of money into these two companies to expand their infrastructure, likely to the order of **$100 billion.** These two companies are the only shipbuilders with an extensive knowledge base for making warships and submarines, both are also the only two who are able to make nuclear ships which are attractive for a future navy. In addition to hundreds of billions of infrastructure improvements, there will be 10s or 100s of billions of dollars placed for warships as the U.S. fleet is incredibly aged and most ships need replacing or modernizing.

**The U.S. wants more commercial shipping power**
The U.S. is stuck between a rock and a hard place when it comes to commercial shipping. China, Japan, and Korea make up the majority of the world's ships. Because of the Jones Act, the U.S. shipping industry has essentially stalled entirely. Jones Act for reference requires any goods shipped from U.S. to U.S. to be on a U.S.-staffed, U.S.-built ship. This force makes U.S. cargo ships incredibly expensive to build. So much so that it is cheaper to permanently use other country's ships than to build a domestic maritime fleet. China and Korea conversely have massive cargo fleets. China continues to take a huge portion of the world trade, looking back to the U.S. lowering Naval force, countries begin to lose the incentive to trade with the U.S. To counter this, the U.S. needs to build a workable merchant fleet. Where China has over 5500 merchant ships, the U.S. has ~80 ships total. This is a huge disparity that is again going to require huge infrastructure upgrades which will be primarily awarded to current shipbuilders. Although there are slightly more commercial shipbuilders in the U.S., $HII remains in one of the best positions to pivot towards the industry, possibly bringing again 10s or 100s of billions of $. Congress has been doing research into this recently and has identified that the U.S. lacks almost any shipbuilding capability for a merchant fleet, threatening our world order. Again the U.S. doesn't like to lose and a new policy will likely arrive shortly.

**Why $HII and not $GD**
Both of these companies are going to profit an incredible amount from these probably new policies. $HII gives more exposure to the rapid growth though because almost their entire profit comes from ships. $GD by comparison is only about a quarter because they are diversified into several other industries.

HII specifically has an annual revenue of $11.5 billion and a backlog of $48.1 billion ships that have already been ordered. This, combined with the U.S. government's utter reliance on $HII and $GD, makes it an incredibly safe play. The company is far too big to fail and if it did fail, the U.S. could lose its global supremacy. Big Daddy Sam will just hand them some more money if they make any real mistakes. Again because there are only two shipbuilders, $HII continues to operate with almost no diversification as a shipbuilder giving them maximum exposure to the policy change. The aforementioned policies that are likely on the way would be in addition to the nearly guaranteed annual orders placed, most of which are almost a decade planned in advance if not more.

$HII and $GD have a huge edge over other U.S. defense contractors as well. Other defense contractors have charged huge amounts for R&D and when the U.S. is in a crunch they will just ramp up manufacturing. $HII by comparison has historically stalled because of Naval shrinkage. Shipbuilding is not something that can be easily automated and will require massive infrastructure increases in addition to raw ship orders.

Disclaimer, I own a bunch of $HII stock and $HII calls.

**Update: 2/20 9:30PM**

I did some crayon drawings. I know you like those. Essentially, put buying/selling was mostly flat today. Call selling was in control from the open until early afternoon. Bottomed out around 2:30PM and then we saw call buying into close. Take this as bullish or bearish as you please, I really have no idea what to expect tomorrow.

In addition, here is the volatility skew on NVDA for this Friday's exp. It is calls to the right, puts to the left which is the opposite of what you may be used to. I have never seen a volatility skew like this. It's not a smirk, it's a goddamn sneer. It's like it's laughing at us and just betting us to buy more calls. To say the volatility is heavily skewed to the call side would be an understatement. Some traders see this as the market is favoring an upside move, some see it as a better chance of a reversal when the market gets too lopsided like this. The IV crush on these calls will be massive post-ER. Again, take it as you choose.

Rocket Labs USA,40,1asgiye,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1asgiye/rocket_labs_usa/,71,2024-02-17 00:29:15,"Rocket Lab is a private aerospace manufacturer and small satellite launch service provider that has gained attention in recent years for its innovative approach to space launch. 

Attention has been slowing down a bit and there's been some dead cat accusations, so I thought I'd do a short write up on why I'm full port. 

When I'm drunk in USVI lounging and binging star trek, I'll think of you guys. 

Short Term Bull Case: 

1. Rapid Launch Capability: Rocket Lab's Electron rocket has made a name for itself as one of the most frequent launch vehicles in the industry, with a fast and flexible launch schedule that enables it to quickly place satellites into orbit. 

2. Diverse Customer Base: Rocket Lab has established a solid customer base with a diverse range of clients from government agencies to commercial enterprises, contributing to a steady stream of launch contracts. 

3. Strong Financial Backing: The company has received significant investments from various sources, including venture capital firms and government contracts, providing the necessary financial support for its ambitious goals. 

4. Expanding Launch Facilities: Rocket Lab has been expanding its launch facilities with additional launch pads, such as Launch Complex 2 in the United States, which increases its launch capacity and geographic reach. 

5. Advanced Technology: Rocket Lab's focus on innovation and advanced technology, such as its 3D-printed Rutherford engines and Photon satellite platform, sets it apart from competitors and positions it well for future growth. 

Long Term Bull Case: 

6. Sustainable Launch Costs: Rocket Lab's commitment to reducing launch costs through mass production and efficient manufacturing processes could make it a competitive choice for small satellite launches in the long term. 

7. Space Exploration Opportunities: With the increasing interest in space exploration and satellite deployment, Rocket Lab's services may become even more valuable as new markets and opportunities emerge. 

8. Potential for Reusable Rockets: Rocket Lab has announced plans to develop a reusable version of its Electron rocket, which could further drive down launch costs and increase its competitiveness. 

9. Commitment to Sustainability: The company's focus on sustainability, including plans to mitigate space debris and utilize electric propulsion, aligns with growing societal and regulatory concerns about environmental impact. 

10. Strategic Partnerships: Rocket Lab has formed partnerships with other aerospace companies and government agencies, positioning itself to take advantage of collaborative opportunities and leverage combined resources for future missions. 

Bear Case: 

Despite its successes, Rocket Lab faces potential challenges, such as increased competition from other small satellite launch providers, technological setbacks, or unforeseen market shifts that could impact its growth trajectory. 

Rocket Lab's missions include deployments for various clients, such as commercial imaging satellites, weather observation satellites, and scientific research payloads. 

Rocket Lab's rapid launch capability, diverse customer base, advanced technology, and potential for long-term growth position it favorably in the competitive space launch industry. 

Space is the final frontier boyos, the value in this and tbh $LUNR can't be overlooked."
