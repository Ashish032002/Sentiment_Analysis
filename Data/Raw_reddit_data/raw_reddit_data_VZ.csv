"If Trump coming: KR, Gun Stocks, NVDA/Semiconductors, VZ, VIX ETF",0,1eaca6o,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1eaca6o/if_trump_coming_kr_gun_stocks_nvdasemiconductors/,60,2024-07-23 22:01:53,"Hello all, new to trading short-term but up about 40% long over the last 3 years... Thinking about selling out of some longs positions for some short-term with the election coming up.

1. KR - merger was blocked the last 2 years by the Biden administration. I believe that at the very least, this is a good long-term hold since they do not seem to be backing off of the hope that they can push that merger. Additionally, following the assassination attempt/Biden dropping, it seems like Trump is a lock for the white house.
2. Gun stocks - Mainly the following: OLN, RGR, SWBI, and VSTO. This is probably the most speculative of my investments and the most short-term/risky. Essentially, the idea is that, following the assassination attempt, the right will be looking to buy more guns to defend themselves, and the left will be looking for an opportunity to regulate. Regulation whispers often boost gun sales as well and if Trump is elected and the right holds senate and house, we could even see some pro NRA rhetoric boosting prices. Again, this is extremely speculative and by far my riskiest position.
3. NVDA/Semiconductors - when is the sell point here? For me, I am debating a post NVDA earnings sell depending on the risk associated with Taiwan/China. Personally, I think China wants to show force in an effort to encourage the Biden administration to offer favorable sanctions to them in an effort to maintain peace. I think regardless, Trump wants to see American business thrive which means Taiwan maintains trade with US companies. Otherwise, if there is any sort of action taken against Taiwan, the semi-conductor industry could plummet at which point you could buy back in. I think NVDA/Semiconductors are a long position worth keeping, but there may be money to be gained based on international tension.
4. Vz - Here is where we get into positions i'm considering buying into.  VZ is down 31% over the last 5 years while maintaining a position as a giant of the wireless industry. Historically, they have experienced an upswing come the turn of the year after all of their winter deals bring an influx of customers. I think that, seeing their broadband subscribers increase, should provide with a good opportunity to buy in at least for the short-term if not for the long term as I believe their outlook exceeds this quarter's performance which led to a nice little sale on the whole. This is probably my biggest possible buy if I sell out of my semi-conductor position for some outside exposure

5.VIX - the final position on the list, the ever-scary VIX ETF. We have been in a position we havent seen in a while, the VIX has not hit above $20 once this year. I think that is poised to change, not only due to the election, but because there is massive change to come. Regardless of if it is chinese/taiwan relations, The presidential election being a non-incumbent regardless of outcome, or interest rate speculation, something has to give. When the other shoe drops, be it in the election or post-election antics, this would be a buy-in for September and sell off in December if ever there is a spike. Take loss for 2024 if you don't see the gain and keep it extra short and sweet. This is my least-informed and riskiest take and one I like but probably won't even take myself due to the risk and volatility of any VIX etf.

VZ has had a growing revenue stream the past few years, and their net income has almost doubled since 2016. they are in no danger to fall into bankruptcy, speaking of, their debt has been steadily growing, but in the past few quarters and in 2022, they have been no longer taking on more debt as it has basically leveled out at **$170-180B of debt**. Now speaking of their dividend, their current div yield is 7.25%, it is expected to decrease as it's share price increases but the dividend payout per share has been increasing for quite a while, there is some concern regarding the dividend payout ratio, however, it has been decreasing, which is a good sign that VZ is undergoing a project of sorts that will stimulate growth, or that they are looking into paying back it's debts. VZ has also been undergoing a management change, I would like to point out that VZ is only a buy right now, while it is low, and that it's **dividend is safe,** which is contradictory to many. My target price is 50-60 however it depends on market conditions once we reach that point, finally, if this investment doesn't go as planned, I still have a good dividend, it is a **win win**.

I currently hold about $75K worth of put options.

https://preview.redd.it/af5bekx5mnkd1.png?width=1446&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6810c2952b06106505550bb0a6101c2560527b2

Here’s why I think ASTS is headed for a big drop:

**1.The Surge Itself is the Biggest Bearish Signal**

ASTS has skyrocketed nearly 2000% in just three months. For comparison, NVDA took three years to climb 2000% from its COVID-19 low, and NVDA actually had strong revenue and profit growth backing it up. ASTS, on the other hand, is a company that might not even be profitable until 2028. There's no comparison in terms of valuation or future potential.

A rapid stock price increase often leads to profit-taking pressure and can even cause unforeseen operational issues for the company. According to their Q2 report, ""The increase in fair value of warrant liabilities resulted in a loss of $66.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, largely due to a significant increase in our share price."" The stock price is now three times higher than it was on June 30th. If it doesn’t drop, I expect warrants to cause an even bigger loss in Q3, possibly between $200 to $300 million. ASTS only has $287.6 million in cash and cash equivalents, so this would be a heavy blow to their balance sheet.

**2.Launching Satellites Requires Continuous Funding**

They’re launching five satellites in September, and they’ll need to launch 25 or 95 more after that. 

According to their Q2 report,""We currently estimate we will need to raise approximately $275.0 million to $325.0 million to fund operating expenses and capital expenditures necessary to design, assemble and launch 20 Block 2 BB satellites and operate a constellation of 25 BB satellites."" ""We plan to achieve service in the selected, targeted geographical areas with the launch and operation of 25 BB satellites and achieve substantial service in all targeted geographical areas to meet our long-term business goals with the launch and operation of approximately 95 BB satellites.""

Their 2024 operating funds are in place, but I believe they’ll need to raise $275 to $325 million in 2025, and if they want to scale up to 95 satellites in 2026, they’ll need at least $1.1 to $1.3 billion. This means they’ll need to issue new stock or debt. Based on past actions, they’ll likely choose convertible debt. They’ve already issued about $310.8 million in convertible debt, and using the $5.75 conversion price from the January 2024 issuance of $110 million in convertible notes (I couldn’t find records for all their convertible debt), that converts to about 53 million shares—roughly one-third of the current shares outstanding.

My view is that the existing convertible debt will inevitably convert to stock, diluting shareholder equity, and they’ll need to keep issuing debt or stock to raise funds. The debt or stock issued will turn into company assets, and for a telecom-like company, the P/B ratio is usually below 2. For instance, VZ’s P/B ratio is 1.8, and AT&T’s is 1.34. However, ASTS has a staggering P/B ratio of 33.66. This means either the current price is way too high, or they’ll need to issue a lot of new shares in the future, either of which would drive the stock price down.

**3.History Shows a Sharp Pullback is Inevitable After a Rapid Surge**

I believe ASTS has long-term potential and could reach $50 or $100, but that might not happen until 2028 or 2030, not now. We’re currently in the phase where the stock has surged 2000%, and both volume and price are starting to decline. Based on ASTS’s past behavior, sharp rallies are typically followed by 50%-90% corrections. For example, in early February 2021, the stock doubled, hitting a high of $25.370 on February 10th, only to drop to $11.21 by March 4th. Two months later, on April 19, 2021, it was down to $7.12.

Again, in late July 2022, the stock doubled, peaking at $14.270 on August 17th, but by the end of September, it was down to $7, and by December, it was only $3.6.

So, I expect a reasonable pullback of 50%-75% over the next one to three months, with a more extreme drop of 80%-90% possible in the worst-case scenario."
VZ bullish crossover building up on weekly ,12,1ea9msw,https://i.redd.it/pkrzt15n6aed1.png,7,2024-07-23 20:15:36,"VZ missed earnings earlier this week but TA has a long awaited bullish crossover on the weekly period.

VZ - Upside from iPhone / Apple,19,1dhlyia,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1dhlyia/vz_upside_from_iphone_apple/,10,2024-06-17 06:25:33,"Positions:

# With Apple Intelligence coming to consumers later this year, I think VZ is ready to break out. It's been trading cheap over the past 12 months largely due to EPA/Lead worries and other economic risks. Despite this, major iPhone enhancements/upgrades historically led to significant VZ gains.

# Factors to Consider

1. **Historical Impact of iPhone Upgrade Cycles**: Historically, major iPhone releases have led to increased sales and activations for telecom companies. For example, previous upgrade cycles have seen spikes in new customer acquisitions and higher data plan sales.
2. **5G Expansion**: Verizon’s ongoing investment in 5G technology is likely to align well with new iPhone models, especially if they leverage advanced 5G capabilities. This could lead to higher customer demand for Verizon's 5G services.
3. **Market Trends and Analyst Forecasts**: Current analyst forecasts project Verizon’s stock to have an average price target of $43.8 in the next 12 months without factoring in a new iPhone cycle​ ([Stock Analysis](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/vz/forecast/))​.

# Estimating the Impact

To estimate the potential impact of an iPhone upgrade cycle, we can look at the effect of previous major upgrades on Verizon's stock price and adjust current projections accordingly. Let's assume a 5-10% positive impact based on historical data and the increased demand for 5G services.

Verizon's stock price should reach **$55-60** in 12 months. This estimation is based on historical impacts of iPhone releases, current market conditions, and the assumption that the upgrade cycle would have a positive effect similar to past cycles. Plus, don't forget, you're getting a nice divi every quarter while you wait for the iPhone pop."
"$VZ at a historical low, should I buy?",40,zuxc0w,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/zuxc0w/vz_at_a_historical_low_should_i_buy/,59,2022-12-25 18:05:05,"$VZ is now at a historical low, since 2012 the stock hasn’t reached these prices. The stock has gone down 28% in 2022, while $S&P 500 has gone down 19.7%.

$VZ is one of the world’s largest technologies communication services in the world, offers communications, technology, information, and entertainment products and services to consumers, businesses, and governmental entities worldwide. $VZ is #1 in Customer Satisfaction with Small Business Wireless Service, 2 years in a row, and awarded the most reliable 5G Network in America.

$VZ plans to use 5G to deliver fixed broadband services to homes, Cable TV currently dominates in residential broadband, and it is planned to reach 30 million homes by the end of 2023.

**$VZ vs $T-PA:**

* In 4G LTE $VZ is much more exposed and has nationwide coverage than any of its major competitors.
* Currently, $T-PA has a broader 5G network than $VZ at the moment, with 18% coverage compared to $VZ which has only 11% but is accelerating fast and will probably pull ahead in the near future (has large financial and network assets)
* $T-PA products are slightly more affordable but $VZ provides more available features and consistency in premium data allowances.

Venue growth is the main issue for $VZ, the U.S wireless market is saturated, and **many consumers delayed upgrading to new smartphones**.

**Ratios and financials:**

* **Market cap**\- $VZ 161.315B USD
* **Yearly revenue** standing at $135.651B
* Revenue YoY Quarterly Growth is **up by 4.029%**
* **Debt To Equity Ratio** 1.773 a 18.43% decrease from the last period.
* **$VZ current dividend yield is 6.88%!!**
* $VZ ROE 0.221% compared to $T-PA 0.109%
* Price to FCF of $VZ is 10.94 compared to $T-PA is 5.84, $T-PA clearly at an advantage.

#The Spreadsheet
To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T-_0-_jgomORReMCZ4S4M4ZMnJkgGYoyPfe7zXvN_cE/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you’re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn’t working for you, refer to [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T-_0-_jgomORReMCZ4S4M4ZMnJkgGYoyPfe7zXvN_cE/edit?usp=sharing) instead!

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Snapchat is inefficiently priced.** Since going public, $SNAP has had an average post earnings move of **17%**. At the time of writing, the options chain is pricing in a move of only **10%**. This priced move will ***shrink*** as we progress through the week since theta will decay the contracts, meaning we’ll likely have a priced move closer to **8%** the day before the ER. Snapchat has ***never*** moved less than 6% post earnings since IPO, meaning that If you're gambling on this one, the odds are really in your favour. 6% minimum historical move, 17% average move, 8% priced move - The risk reward profile of this trade almost seems too good to be true. We ran this exact trade last quarter and made a huge bag, so I’m really hoping we get to abuse this free money glitch again come Thursday. 

&nbsp;

- **Netflix is inefficiently priced.** Same deal as $SNAP, just not as good. Netflix usually moves 8%, but options are only pricing in 5%. I don’t like this play as much as $SNAP since a straddle will run you over three grand, and that’s not exactly gambling money. Regardless, those with huge accounts and even bigger balls may opt to run this trade.

&nbsp;

- **Airline stocks aren’t priced properly (yet).** Delta Airlines tanked 5% post ER last week, resulting in the rest of the airlines also tanking 5%. $DAL closed the week down 6%, while the rest of the airlines recovered, ultimately closing out the week flat / slightly negative. This indicates to me that airlines aren’t priced properly at all - Delta had an amazing ER and put out some banger numbers, but tanked despite that due to the concerns in rising fuel prices. Rising fuel prices will end up plaguing ***all airlines***, not just $DAL exclusively, meaning that unless the airlines put up mind-blowing numbers (which are also better than the insane numbers $DAL put up), **a downward move is likely imminent.** I’m genuinely shocked that the other airline stocks recovered throughout the week despite the headwinds they’ll all inevitably face during their ERs this week. Keep in mind, this analysis is made void if airlines slip throughout the week going into earnings as market re-prices them. I could be entirely wrong about this move - we’ve seen time and time again that the market is extremely irrational.

&nbsp;

- **Collateral Plays are your friend!** As displayed by the airlines last week (and hopefully later this week), stocks within the same sector tend to move together. If we’re bullish or bearish on airlines, we can look to long or short $JETS, as almost all of its holding report earnings this week. The IV on $JETS is half that of the reporting tickers, meaning we’ll get huge gains on a relatively small move. Most of the steel sector also reports this week! We can look to long or short the entirety of steel earnings by playing $X or $MT since we’ll see a comparable move in those tickers as well, but won’t get IV crushed. More information on these types of plays can be found [here.](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays)

#Summary and Conclusion

We've got ourselves an awesome week of earnings this time round! There's many trades that have a great risk-reward ratio on them this week, which is extremely odd considering that playing earnings is usually a crapshoot. Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T-_0-_jgomORReMCZ4S4M4ZMnJkgGYoyPfe7zXvN_cE/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people find the sheet useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment, it would mean a lot to me! If you want access to more trading tools, have any specific questions or observations you’d like to share with the community, feel free to check out the community links in the spreadsheet. **Happy Trading! :)**"

"Fundamental & Comps Analysis for VZ, T, and TMUS. Fair value estimates included.",45,n8ok60,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n8ok60/fundamental_comps_analysis_for_vz_t_and_tmus_fair/,34,2021-05-10 03:22:32,"**Model**: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mf3adRWo5YyW5l56TLDG0ZvZ7GfEeNv7oGc3kG50JAk/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mf3adRWo5YyW5l56TLDG0ZvZ7GfEeNv7oGc3kG50JAk/edit?usp=sharing)

**Methodology**:

* Created a three-statement model for Verizon Communications., AT&T., and T-mobile US
* Combined this model with a WACC build-up to create an unlevered DCF and derived a fair-value-per-share estimate using a growth in perpetuity and an exit EBITDA multiple approach
* Spread comparable companies (these 3 + CHTR, T.TO, and BCE.TO)
* Combined results from DCF and select comps valuations to arrive at final estimates

**How to use the model**

* Anywhere you see blue text is OK to edit, and should not result in breaking anything. Green text = taken from another worksheet, so if you want to change one of those cells I recommend following the trail first
* To make meaningful changes to the 3-statement-model, scroll to the bottom of each ""Financials"" page to tweak assumptions about revenue growth, GPM, and other assumptions. You can also adjust the specifics for each case scenario from here
* I have tried to supply pessimistic assumptions about terminal growth rates and exit EBITDA multiples in the DCF models. Feel free to adjust C43 and H43 as needed, keeping in mind the model is very sensitive to these inputs
* WACC buildup can be done however you want. If you have access to a Bloomberg terminal you can get a better adjusted beta than I used, and a more precise cost of debt (more on that below), or you can just use the override cell to put in a WACC% directly
* Trading Comps Input essentially works to arrive at normalized multiples before converting to an output. Do not be intimidated by non-Gaap disclosures. Everything here is available on annual reports, quarterly reports, and press releases.
* For trading comps outputs, simply toggle the companies in column B until you have the company you wish to analyze in the first position, and the other comps below it, then head to Valuation Matrix to see the results.
* Feel free to adjust the assumptions, there are a lot of them
* If you can think of an assumption better than something I have here, or if you spot a mistake let me know!

**Other Notes:**

* I Imported the model from excel to Google Sheets before sharing --> if something is broken, let me know so I can go in and fix it
* Of particular note in the comps spread is Charter Communications options outstanding. They provide a dollar figure, so I worked backwards to arrive at the correct value for Gross proceeds from exercise of options
* Rogers Communications would have been included in the comps analysis, but I felt the pending merger would skew multiples beyond what could realistically be compared with the US big 3. I should probably include Vodafone but I was so excited to share! Maybe if you check back in I'll have added it :)
* Used 10Y YTM bond data on FINRA to arrive at assumptions for cost-of-debt used in WACC build-up. If you have access to a bloomberg terminal you can grab the bond with the best volume and use that.
* I have my own opinions about the intangibles of these companies (management, forward looking results of the recent spectrum auction etc.) but I feel that if people want to chat about those things the comment section would be a better place to do it!
* I apologize for ambiguity (especially on the non-gaap stuff) but I couldn't figure out how to remove my name from the comments quickly (if you know how to do this, other than going one-by-one through each comment, let me know and I'll reupload). Most comments were simply memos to myself to remember what each cell consists of beyond the label (i.e., components of ""other current assets"")
* A thousand more things. If you want to know just ask.

**None of this is financial advice. This is an exercise I did for my own use and thought this sub might find it entertaining.**  
**Do your own Due Diligence.**  
**I own VZ stock.**

Traders have pinned VZ price point to ES futures,5,yr0nyj,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yr0nyj/traders_have_pinned_vz_price_point_to_es_futures/,6,2022-11-10 06:12:27,"I'm simply just trying to start a discussion regarding $VZ Verizon Communications. But man o' man I sound so crazy. I'll try to explain, but honestly you can watch this play out in real time majority of the trading week.

Traders have repeatedly pinned [$VZ](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24VZ&src=cashtag_click) to /ES Futures. $37.60/ 3760 for todays 3:00p.m. CT close. Over the past 45 days this trend has held true nearly 90% of trading days. Whats it signaling? Whose capable of doing this so regularly with all of the volatility and uncertainty. 

Today was one of the few trading days of the past 45 where a gap between the two widened and then ultimately fell back to $VZ price point. Let me explain.

Had the news about $FTX not dropped $VZ from a technical stand point was set to trickle back to the $38.34  level and peak out around $38.63 by Friday. I was preparing to remove the puts and switch over but the news brought negative sentiment. RSI crashed and there was an EMA-Moving Average ribbon trend reversal that took place. Essentially, stay bearish. Because I've been following this strange, awkward correlation I was confident in my decision.

Essentially today for me, $VZ traders refusing to reach the level of S&P Futures around 11 a.m. ish told the story for the day.

Please before you say i'm crazy, I know I could explain better and I'll attempt to do so. But this isn't something that needs explaining. Open your trading software choose a date within the past 45 days. Use your Heikin Ashi chart type (it displays a slightly different candle, with a slightly different O/C price). Check a /ES futures closing price. Then go to $VZ and do the same. No matter the day, the correlation remains intact.

This sounds so conspiracy, I get it.... I feel like a fool typing this. But NO ONES NOTICED!!! and the $VZ twenty year chart is brutal looking. Tomorrow will be volatile, so it will be one of those rare days of the past 45 where I expect a gap (up or down doesn't matter) that will ultimately slim to the narrowest of margins to be ... near identical....  by close of trading day.

All I ask is pick a date. Heck go back to August, maybe even July because that's where the trend starts. Scrutinize $VZ and /ES Futures price correlation from open all the way through close. It's truly amazing andI truly feel like it's worth monitoring. 

I could thoroughly sit and list each matching close but honestly you all should see for yourselves.

Thank you guys."

The Bull Case For Verizon: Why the Stock is Due for a Major Breakout,801,ihjsoi,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ihjsoi/the_bull_case_for_verizon_why_the_stock_is_due/,361,2020-08-27 17:35:24,"Hello fellow retards, I have a retarded thesis for you that I Hope makes us all a metric fuck ton of crispy tendies. Josh Brown recently said on an episode of Halftime Report ""Close your eyes and buy Verizon."" I could not agree more.   


I. The Social Aspect  
Verizon is the nation's largest and most comprehensive wireless mobile carrier. Their network has constantly performed in the top rankings for JD Power and Root Metrics. They are also poised to deliver big on 5G, and recently had the NAD BBB shutdown TMUS adds claiming to be a better 5G network. They also have exposure to home internet service and cable TV through their Fios division. Due to the pandemic work from home / school from home is going to  become a staple in the American routine going forward. We are going to need more powerful devices on more powerful networks to complete simple tasks we used to do in person.   


II. The Fundamentals  
Right now Verizon is trading just under $59, with a historic ATH at $62 which it made on Dec 19'. Verizon is also the cheapest with a P/E of 12.85 any of the Major 3 wireless carrier, A&TT has a P/E of 18+ while TMUS is around 37+. The important thing and probably the most significant is the dividend Verizon pays which yields around 4% and has constantly been lauded by boomers and income investors. This dividend is going to be very important due to the Fed keeping interest rates near 0 for the next 5 years. Investors are going to flood into stable dividend companies in the hunt for yield, and right now Verizon is the cheapest with the best reputation.   


III. The Technicals   
Verizon is sitting at the 78% Fibb Retracement from its ATH back in Dec, if it breaks and holds above 59.50 it has a real shot at grinding to $62 over the next few weeks. I'd look to add between $56-59 and cut bait if we retrace below $55.

IV. The Trade  
I am currently positioned in the Oct 16. $70 calls ($5 each) as I anticipate a move into the low-mid 60's by the end of September. I might add some Jan $70 strikes depending on how low the stock goes and how they are priced to the Oct. The great thing about VZ is it is a low IV stock that generally doesn't move much, however this gives us the ability to bet small but win big.

Edit: Thank you all the bulls who came in on this trade with me! I appreciate the kind words, we will all dine on all you can eat tendies in bull Valhalla. 

Edit2: I wanted to address the hate on $70 strike, I don’t believe we’ll actually hit the $70 or go above it. I chose this strike for its cheap cost and gamma exposure. I am really looking for a move to the mid-60’s. I believe this is fully doable do to low interest rates,great yield, cheap p/e, and socioeconomical norms (basically what my DD says you fucking retards). 

Edit3: [I am still holding. I am not trying to P/D just want us all on the TENDIE TRAIN](https://imgur.com/gallery/4kzYHt7) 

Edit4: Some good news this week.

VZ signed a $6B deal with Samsung for production of 5G equipment.

VZ won $2B of 5G spectrum at the auction, multiples more than the next highest bidder.

Argus raised their price target to $68. 

Verizon raised their dividend by 2%.


Edit4: Not Financial Advice. I am autistic. 

TLDR;/ VZ $70 10/16"
Why buy a trashed stock like VZ about now?,18,rdcz04,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rdcz04/why_buy_a_trashed_stock_like_vz_about_now/,11,2021-12-10 22:24:28,"Antique trader POV

Years ago, I realized that after hot stocks I was chasing had topped they made a shape that looked like the  outline of Batman's head.  

Eventually I learned that the two ""ears"" on  the head shape were called a ""Double top"" and the psychology of the market was that buyers were reaching a ""this is as high as we buy"" decision which created that pattern repeatedly over the course of a  stock topping.

Of course, it didn't take long for me to look for an ""Upside down Batman Head"" to see if that was a thing too.  Well, duh,  that is called a ""Double Bottom"" ... and again the psychology is simple  -- the two ears are the flash point where Sellers decide, ""this is a  cheap as we will sell.""

I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed ... so it took a lot of repeats for me to start to actually try to avoid the fall off the head of a ""Batman"" and to become patient enough to look for the upside down head and ears that meant I could actually be buying cheap.

 Verizon, I believe is creating the ""Head"" portion of the upside down bottoming ""Upside down Batman head.""  Now, if this really is the bottom for VZ, there will probably be that slow arc off the lows, followed by the flash down that stays above the previous low -- the second ""Batman Ear""

But it sure feels like we are close to getting some upside down Batman VZ head...

That being said, they have some massive debt like all telecoms do, which they are well able to handle. Inflation being at an all time high and not looking like it'll be waning over the coming few months at least, I'm considering buying OTM calls on VZ (strike price 55 or 57.50, expiring Jan 20, 2023), my thesis is that they will become increasingly profitable since inflation will eat away at their debts while they should have some decent pricing power with them being one of the bigger players in 5g. Interest rates might go up a little but our lord and savior JPOW has shown that he is only willing to raise rates ever so slightly if inflation keeps going on a rampage. In addition, 5g might actually allow them to take away some market share from those providers slower to adopt. Do any of you crayon munching tendydropping loss porn enthusiasts agree, disagree or simply don't understand anything that isn't 'GME', 'MOASS' or 'DRS'? Let's discuss!

Thus, I decided to test this explicitly. I wanted to see if PE ratio ACTUALLY mattered. I found that it matters A LOT... if you want to lose money 😂

# DD on PE

[I have a full writeup here](https://nexustrade.io/blog/you-will-never-look-at-a-stocks-pe-ratio-the-same-after-reading-this-20240319). First, I used an LLM to find 10 stocks with a PE ratio below 10 that had the highest market caps as of **January 1st 2023**. I got the following list:

* Company: Exxon Mobil Corporation (Symbol: XOM)
   * Description: Engages in the exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas globally.
   * P/E Ratio: 9.04616
   * Market Cap: $471,642,800,000
* Company: Pfizer Inc. (Symbol: PFE)
   * Description: Discovers, develops, and sells biopharmaceutical products worldwide.
   * P/E Ratio: 9.65214
   * Market Cap: $287,302,680,000
* Company: Toyota Motor Corporation (Symbol: TM)
   * Description: Designs, manufactures, and sells passenger vehicles and related parts globally.
   * P/E Ratio: 7.47751
   * Market Cap: $189,102,358,004
* Company: Verizon Communications Inc. (Symbol: VZ)
   * Description: Provides communications, technology, and entertainment products and services worldwide.
   * P/E Ratio: 8.5848
   * Market Cap: $165,519,400,000
* Company: ConocoPhillips (Symbol: COP)
   * Description: Explores for, produces, and markets crude oil, natural gas, and LNG globally.
   * P/E Ratio: 8.56037
   * Market Cap: $152,195,338,000
* Company: AT&T Inc. (Symbol: T)
   * Description: Provides telecommunications and technology services worldwide.
   * P/E Ratio: 6.76593
   * Market Cap: $140,781,270,000
* Company: QUALCOMM Incorporated (Symbol: QCOM)
   * Description: Develops  foundational technologies for the wireless industry globally.
   * P/E Ratio: 9.54411
   * Market Cap: $123,352,680,000
* Company: The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (Symbol: GS)
   * Description: Provides financial services for corporations, institutions, and individuals worldwide.
   * P/E Ratio: 9.02693
   * Market Cap: $121,899,900,000
* Company: Intel Corporation (Symbol: INTC)

   * P/E Ratio: 8.12612
   * Market Cap: $108,838,740,000
* Company: Citigroup Inc. (Symbol: C)
   * Description: Provides financial products and services globally.
   * P/E Ratio: 5.71683
   * Market Cap: $87,814,045,000

I then ran a backtest on these stocks from **Jan 1st, 2023 to March 19th, 2024**. I did ""Buy and Hold"" for each stock on this list. I then got the following results.

[Backtesting \\""Buy and Hold\\"" across these 10 stocks](https://preview.redd.it/qenikmgz28pc1.png?width=2054&format=png&auto=webp&s=c05cd8ee1b41370712194f63b262e56b0742bae7)

Most of the stocks in the portfolio like Toyota, Verizon, and AT&T were flat. Intel was a ""big"" winner and Pfizer was a huge loser. In the end, **this combination of stocks didn't even outperform SPY.**

This is in contrast to something like Cash Flow, which has been shown to *slightly* outperform the S&P 500.

[Seeing how well 5 companies with the highest free cash flow increase from 2016 to 2020 performed. This stategy outperformed the market.](https://preview.redd.it/e6fokktp48pc1.png?width=2054&format=png&auto=webp&s=1232f6c7ec93a70aec2efbdbc18b9da620f2af23)

# What did we learn?

Know that next time, ANYTIME someone says ""the PE ratio is low"", they are officially a regard and a parrot that regurgitates NPC talking points. PE ratio means jack-diggedly squat, and literally can't outperform SPY. At the same time, other metrics (like the increase in free cash flow) actually matters when picking good stocks.

shares fell 3.2% in Tuesday premarket trading after the sports apparel and accessories company reported second-quarter earnings that fell, but met expectations. The company had net income of $6.3 million, or 12 cents per share, versus net income of $14.8 million million, or 3 cents per share, for the same period last year. Revenue for the quarter totaled $1 billion, up from $783.6 million for the same period last year, also meeting the FactSet consensus. 

International sales represented 15 percent of total sales but grew 68 percent compared with the second quarter of 2015. The brand has opened 60 new international Under Armour stores this year.

Within product categories, Under Armour saw its strongest growth in footwear, where sales climbed 58 percent to $243 million as consumers bought from the Stephen Curry signature basketball line and running and cleated shoes.

--------------------------------------------------------------

McDonald's Corp $MCD - 

posted weaker-than-expected same-store sales in its latest quarter, a sign that the boost from its all-day breakfast offerings may be receding.
Shares fell 3% to $123.6 in premarket trading.

Over all for the three months ended in June, McDonald's reported a profit of $1.09 billion, or $1.25 a share, compared with $1.2 billion, or $1.26 cents, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned $1.45 a share. Analysts had projected $1.38 in per-share earnings.

All-day breakfast continued to power domestic sales, but the company said it faced ""softening industry growth"" in the period.Since taking the helm last March, Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook has moved to bolster the company's sales by paring down its menu, offering more transparency about how its food is made and launching all-day breakfast at many of its domestic restaurants.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Verizon Communications Inc. $VZ-

reported second-quarter earnings above Wall Street expectations a day after reaching a deal to acquire Yahoo Inc.'s core internet business. Verizon reported net income for the quarter was $831 million, or 17 cents per share, compared with $4.35 billion, or $1.04 per share during the same quarter a year ago. 

Verizon said earnings were negatively impacted by 7 cents due to the seven-week strike by employees in its wireline business. Excluding non-operational items, earnings were 94 cents per share, just above the FactSet consensus of 92 cents. Revenue for the quarter hit $30.53 billion, a 5.3% decline compared with $32.22 billion in the year earlier period. 
The FactSet consensus on revenue was $30.84 billion. 

The cable, internet and phone company said the strike also resulted in a net decline of 13,000 Fios internet connections and 41,000 video connections. The company also mentioned its $4.83 billion deal on Monday to buy Yahoo's core business, which is expected to close in the first quarter 2017. ""By acquiring Yahoo, we are scaling up to be a major competitor in mobile media,"" Chief Executive Lowell McAdam said in a statement. "

UA- looking at the chart this stock had a big gap up on earnings. It has begun its continued downtrend after and is reaching that gap. All gaps need to be filled eventually and this is close to filling it. Vol rank is 60% so either get them call spreads again or get ITM puts on any bounce.

This is both fact and sentiment. What VZ is buying, is the core of the total Yahoo valuation of 40b+... but this is an investment for the future. Maybe it will pay off since Yahoo! still holds some share of internet traffic- but it is very small compared to Google + Facebook. VZ will be scrutinized heavily for this.

There is a lot of people who would invest in Verizon (IT IS THE LARGEST wireless communications company in the US)- but not in Yahoo!, just based on the general sentiment towards Yahoo!. By pitting themselves against Google for a time- Yahoo! is cursed being evaluated against its extremely successful and powerful competitors. By selling out, they prove that they've been mismanaged and are looking for a way out. It doesn't matter what Verizon does at this point with Yahoo- it is taking on negative publicity at a vulnerable time given that the stock of VZ is hitting new highs.

Even if some people are calling this a good purchase, Verizon/Yahoo stock is falling today as a result of the announcement. VZ purchased AOL in Jan 2015 with the same goals to monetize advertising to the few who still used that service. Companies like Google and Facebook are already so heavily integrated in email and other mainstream services already- Verizon is extremely late to the party. 

There is no reason for people to leave Google/FB for an inferior- less integrated service, and tomorrow's earnings report for Verizon will be telling a big story. They only stand to gain from international traffic- like in China where Google is blocked. Google is also pushing communications providers into faster services by providing cheap fiber optics in certain US cities. Verizon is a bloated giant, with lots of revenue from overpriced services. Its purchases to maintain revenue streams in advertising + data are just typical of struggling innovators in technology. If you can't do something special, better to use your buzz to coast into obscurity than admit you cannot compete with the big boys who actually care about giving consumers good, fairly-priced services and tank all at once. Verizon is a cell carrier and so it shall remain.

Consider loss of revenue from Q2- this could be a catalyst for the correction when earnings are announced tomorrow morning.
[Verizon strike of 2016 - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verizon_strike_of_2016)

Also, consider the recent criticisms of Verizon for its involvement in political donations, and the further smearing of the Democratic party as a result of the DNC email leaks that recently came out.

So many of y’all seem to fall for the stock market gambit of buying overpriced companies over and over again. Case in point, kudos to anyone who bought $META at $90 in November. It was in deep value territory with tons of negative sentiment. Now up 250%.

My goal is to find similarly beaten up stocks which have asymmetric risk and a high chance of big payout. The three names I’ve taken a position in are PayPal, 3M, and Alibaba.

Forward PE of all three companies are ridiculously low in their respective industries:

PayPal: 12

3M: 11

Alibaba: 9

All while return on invested capital and margins are quite high for their industries. Share buybacks are increasing for all of them as well, which is a fantastic sign when they are trading significantly cheaper than their peers.

I’m not going to go over every detail of the financials or business, but similar to meta, there’s very little reason for any of them to have dropped this much other than overblown media hit pieces. They’re financially sound companies. 

Would love to hear other viewpoints that think there’s room to gap lower. 

TLDR: PYPL < $60, MMM < $100 and BABA < $70 have a lot of value potential imo and are worth a deeper look for anyone interested in making money."

Let’s get ready to tumble! Come Monday, $TSLA enters the S&P 500, as the world is aware. This is the one you will tell your grandkids about, or at least the new crop of investors, wondering what the bubble of 2020 was like. Tesla can be your example of the insanity....1/ 

For all of the cost-saving benefits of passive investing, the Standard & Poor’s committee that actively chooses the components for its indices will prove why passive investors are the dumb money with this coming Monday’s inclusion of $TSLA into its venerable S&P 500 index. 2/ 

The committee is not known for a price consciousness. It chases what’s hot and eliminates from its august roster what’s not. 3/ 

It’s disregard for fundamentals or value was seen sharply in late 1999 & early 2000 when bubble darlings like Peoplesoft, New Century Energy, Global Crossing, Xilinx, Teradyne, Quintiles Transnational, Citrix and JDS Uniphase made their way into the index. 4/ 

Pull up the long-term charts to see how these “timely” additions fared post admittance. The most prominent additions in 1999 were America Online (discussed in my 12/5 thread) and Yahoo, whose mania also reminds me of Tesla... 5/ 

Yahoo went public in 1996, priced at $13 per share, opened at $24.50 and closed at $33 on its first trading day, a market cap of $850 million. From there the shares zoomed ahead by more than 6x in 2 years reaching $354 in January 1999. 6/ 

The company then bought Geocities for $3.6B and Broadcast for $5.7B and the stock was more than cut in half, trading down to $120. Recovering by late 1999, the wizards at S&P announced they would add Yahoo to the index on 11/30/1999. 7/ 

The stock climbed 67% from $210 on the day of the announcement to $350 on the day of its inclusion on 12/7, one week later. Sound familiar? The rollercoaster didn’t high point for another month. 8/ 

Yahoo peaked not quite a month later at a share price of $475, a market cap of $127B on January 3, 2000 (the cap didn’t include another 124 million option shares, 38M granted in 1999 alone, which implied an additional \~$50B in market cap on January 3, 2000). 9/ 

In hindsight, or for anyone with reason, which was lacking in those days, there was no need to count the fully diluted shares. Why? Those options would not be exercised. The stock fell 98.3% over the next 1 ¾ years, from $475 to $8.11 on 9/26/2001, a market cap of $2.2B. Yep. 10/ 

At the peak, Yahoo's $127B market cap compared to $600 million in trailing 12-month revenues, so 211 times revenues. 11/ 

But the Yahoo and tech bulls would get right in your face (or on the Yahoo Finance message board) and tell you, moron, that sales had grown 141%, 248%, 258% and 1,345% in the prior 4 years, which they did. 12/ 

Heck, even after the stock dropped from a STOCK PRICE of $475 to $30 (a mere 93.7% in a year for those counting) by the end of 2000, sales still GREW by 88% to $1.1B, to “only” 15 times revenues! From there, however, the company flailed. 13/ 

Sales actually fell 35%, from $1.1B to $717m from 2000 to 2001, which is what drove the shares down to $8.11 and a $2.2B market cap. To what had been the first and dominant home page, and really the dominant search engine, competition came fast. 14/ 

Yahoo even eventually outsourced its search function to upstart Google if you can believe that. Yahoo did ultimately grow its revenues another 5x to $5B by 2016, when it was bought by Verizon $VZ in 2016 for $4.5B, excluding a sub's partial investment in Alibaba. 15/ 

The buyout was at a far cry from the day Yahoo came into the S&P 500 as the 30th largest capitalization in the index, with a market cap of roughly $90B and I’d guess at a weight of 0.7%. 16/ 

At its January 3, 2000 peak, Yahoo had climbed to the #15 spot in the index, well ahead of Berkshire Hathaway $BRKA $BRKB (which was not yet in the index despite its mere $83B market cap, $131B in assets and $38B in shareholders equity.) 17/ 

Had Berkshire been in the index the day Yahoo peaked it would have held only the 37 spot, behind notorious tech darlings Cisco at $358B, Intel $290B, Time Warner $184B, Lucent $171B Sun Mico $168B, AT&T $160B, WorldCom $148B, Dell $130B, HP $120B, Oracle $120B, EMC $116B,... 18/ 

Qualcomm $116B, DirecTV $102B, Verizon $93B, AOL $93B, Motorola $90B, and Bellsouth $87B. Many of these are gone today, which leads us back to $TSLA. 19/ 

Never has the S&P 500 committee brought in a company so large by market cap as will be the case with Tesla's inclusion. Nor have they ever brought in a company at so high a spot in the cap-weighted index, at #6, one notch ahead of Berkshire Hathaway. Insanity. 20/ 

Of course, by sales & profits, plenty of companies have entered the index as larger constituents, but that’s not what counts in the passive index. It’s all about float adjusted market cap. Fundamental valuation matters not. Qualifying for index inclusion required some hijinks.21/ 

Tesla had cut R&D & SG&A, drew on reserves and leaned on environmental carbon credits to “earn” a GAAP profit for a necessary four quarters. They did so for five. Oddly, revenues only grew 15% in 2019, prior to the pandemic, in part for a reduction in customer tax incentives. 22/ 

Impressively, they have grown revenues 15% for the first 9 months of 2020 during the crisis while the incumbents saw sales decline. No doubt the business is growing. But how to value it? 23/ 

On November 16, the S&P index committee announced Tesla would be added on December 21. The market cap was $380B. Here on Saturday December 19, the stock price at $695 yields a market cap of $659B ($BRK, the current #6 is $528B) up $279B or 73% since the announcement. 24/ 

The gain matches the percentage rise seen by Yahoo during the week between its announcement & addition. The $279B gain is LARGER than the $215B market cap of the world’s largest auto manufacturer, Toyota. Tesla’s $659B cap is on 948M shares out at 9/30 (up 5% since YE 2019). 25/ 

The share count excludes another 157M unvested or unexercised option and RSU shares, which would add more than $100B to the market cap on a fully diluted basis. 26/ 

Let’s not count those for the same reason they were excluded in the Yahoo calculation. Why? Many may go unexercised. Why? Nobody in their right mind would pay $659B, $760B diluted, for a car co w/ $30B in sales, little or no economic profit and an enormous growth capital need.27/ 

25x sales? 2,030x GAAP earnings? 422x earnings assuming Toyota’s best in industry 6% profit margin? Heck, even 85 times Microsoft’s 30% profit margin (a bone for the Tesla is not a car company but also a software/robotaxi crowd). Welcome to the game, index fund investors. 28/ 

80% of Tesla’s shares float, not owned by insiders, which means the adjusted market cap weight will be $528B, compelling somewhere between $50 and $75B of direct index purchases, not to mention those needed by index huggers and closet indexers. 29/ 

The stock will come in at \~1.75% of the $30.5 trillion index, itself significantly overvalued, not unlike when Yahoo peaked in January 2000 and the index peaked at over 30x earnings and 44x cyclically adjusted (CAPE) shortly thereafter. 30/ 

What prospective return does the Tesla bull expect, or the passive investor with 1.75% of capital in the shares come Monday? At 15% a year, the market cap, assuming no further dilution, grows to $3T over the next decade, \~10% of the market value of the entire S&P 500 today. 31/ 

At “only” 10% per year, the fully diluted market cap grows to $2 trillion, almost where $AAPL is valued these days. At a 10% shareholder return, to trade at 30x earnings, Tesla will need to be earning $67 billion. 32/ 

For grins let’s assume the company actually earns some blend of auto maker profit (most earn \~3%, Toyota \~6%) and a subscription software, robotaxi margin of 30%. Generously call it a 20% blended profit margin, which I’d bet heavily against. 33/ 

At the impossible 20% margin, $67B would sit under $335B in revenues, roughly 11 times today’s run rate. Revenues will need to grow by almost 28% per year, and profits to 20% of revenues, to get to a 30x multiple on earnings. 34/ 

To finance the necessary capital stock to produce $335B in revenues will require about half that much in capital, either debt or equity. 35/ 

Car companies require roughly a dollar in capital to produce a dollar in revenues, but remember we are ""assuming"" this is a software company or whatever else hallucinogens conjure up in the minds of bulls. 36/ 

The best course of action for Tesla is to keep selling “at-the-market” blocks, with no prospectus, road show or risk warning, to the dumb money that is willing, or compelled, as is the passive crowd, to pay dangerous prices. The dilution at today’s prices is infinitesimal. 37/ 

Through the end of 2019 Tesla had sold $12.7B in shares and borrowed $16B in debt and preferred stock. Total capital raised of $28B exceeded FY 2019 revenues of $25B and produced a $6B cumulative LOSS. 38/ 

So far in 2020, Tesla has borrowed an additional net $200m and sold $12.3B of new shares (assuming a sale of the most recent $5B “at-the-market”). Bulls revere the cash on the balance sheet, but it didn’t come from profit or free cash. 39/ 

Total capital raised is now $40B before retained losses. What does Tesla earn on capital? Nothing yet. Equity is less than capital raised from stock sales by the amount of cumulative losses. Per share book is of course higher thanks to successful stock sales way above book...40/ 

From a business case and investment standpoint, the math doesn’t work. Consider that total automobiles sold worldwide peaked two years ago at about 95m passenger and commercial car and truck units. At $20,000 per new vehicle, we can call the global auto market $2T in size. 41/ 

Our example has Tesla’s market cap growing over the next decade at “only” 10% per year to a like $2T. Car companies, with the exception of Ferrari, which makes three cars per year, don’t trade for one times sales. They trade for less. 42/ 

Toyota, which earns a 6% margin and 6% on capital, trades itself at an all-time-high $215B on revenues of $280B in 2019, less in 2020. 43/ 

Auto manufacturers trade for less than sales because they make \~3% net margins and earn that same \~3% on capital and revenues grow at \~3%. We can call the industry 3x3x3 (new material here folks). The car business is a bad business, and that’s what Tesla is trying to disrupt? 44/ 

The best case for shareholders: If Tesla grows the aforementioned sales for the next decade by 28% to $335B (it won’t), the stock will trade for no more than 1x sales, because it’s a CAR company. 45/ 

If it earns Toyota’s best in class 6% margin, even allowing for software “upgrades,” it earns $20B and trades for 25x, or a $500B market cap, which is a 33% loss from here people using diluted shares. If sales, margins or the multiple are lower, shareholders lose more. 46/ 

The realistic case: The performance of the stock from here is a giant loss over time and the Tesla cult loses interest in the brand. In fact, they come to hate the brand because of their coming stock losses, customer and employee mistreatment. 47/ 

Ask the guys and gals on the S and X lines about their unpaid “break” here at quarter end. Rumor has it they can ""volunteer their time"" to help boost production before yearend. Sales grow nowhere near 28% a year. The incumbent auto manufacturers won’t roll over and play dead. 48/ 

My prior tweet elaborated on [@elonmusk](https://twitter.com/elonmusk) using his inflated shares as currency to acquire another manufacturer w/ capacity, as he mentioned he’d be up for in a friendly merger of equals. The point of that message was that the incumbents won’t take his dangerous scrip in a deal. 49/ 

That leaves Elon with having to sell new shares perpetually to finance his growth. It makes 100% sense when the shares are insanely overvalued to do so, and despite the ethics of doing so in these recent at-the-market deals. 50/ 

By contrast, Mr. Buffett points out he’d prefer new and current shareholders to have a fair experience in his company’s shares. If the auto makers won’t take them in a deal, and they shouldn’t, then that leaves new shareholders to provide growth capital. Hello passive crowd. 51/ 

We’ll see what happens after Monday, when Tesla assumes the #6 perch in the index. When the argument for passive is low fees, remind me in ten years how much of the loss in Tesla’s shares from here should be considered a “fee,” or a tax on stupidity. 52/ 

At 1.75% of the index, a decline of 80-90% would be heavy, but realistic. Impossible to decline that much? An 88% drop takes you all the way back to….where Tesla’s shares began the year. 53/ 

A 90% decline takes the cap to $66B, 2.2x current run rate revenues & 37x a hypothetical 6% net margin. A mere 80% drop gets to a $132B cap, 4.4x revenues, and to give the bulls on Tesla not being a car company credit, still 37x a 12% hypothetical profit margin. Ridiculous. 54/ 

You can play around all you like w/ assumptions for growth, market share, expansion into new markets, profit & returns on capital, but paying for some fractional ownership of today’s $760B fully diluted market value is highly likely to produce a disastrous investment result. 55/ 

Bravo, S&P. The decision to add $TSLA at present valuation is almost sure to exact pain on passive investors, compelled to “invest” 1.75% of capital in one of the most overvalued companies on record. Brilliant. As the other Buffett sings, “Come Monday, it’ll be all right...” 56/ 

As disclosure, I have a small short position in $TSLA. Don’t take this note as investment advice because it’s not. Do your own research. Stocks go up & down, and shorting is extremely dangerous. Upside is capped and downside is unlimited. $TSLA has risen 8.3x just this year. 57/ 

If Tesla repeats the same return over the next year the market cap would be $6.3 trillion. Two years of repeat performance and the cap becomes $52 trillion. Of course, that’s 70% larger than the entire S&P 500, but by then any short seller is long bankrupt. 58/58 END

TL;DR1: TSLA may go down, not probably but maybe at some point after SP500 inclusion. Why? It's mentioned somewhere in above points comparing it to some historical events and what TSLA makes!

TL;DR2 (from u/rch0wdhury): Yahoo failed after being added in S&P. Tesla can fail, or maybe not. We will get to know in future."

What’s poppin’ bull-gang, Flux here with an options exit strategy “guide”. I wanted to make this writeup because more often than not, I see people making fundamentally sound trades, only to have their gains vanish due to having poor exit strategy. They either get too greedy and hold on for way too long, or they exit way too early and miss out on an insane runup and want to die for a couple of days afterwards. There’s two parts to each trade - an entry and an exit - and if you’re caught skimping on either end, you’re gonna be kneecapping your gains on a regular basis. Although this part of trading isn’t glamourous, it’s absolutely vital to your overall success as a trader, so it’s crucial that you learn and study these concepts sooner rather than later. With all that being said, let’s get into it.

&nbsp;

#Types of Exits

There’s three types of exits that I tend to use when I conduct my trades, each useful in their own right. I’ll give a quick summary of them all, before providing an in depth analysis and examples of each.

&nbsp;

- **Fundamental Exits** pertain to any form of exit strategy regarding the change of a company’s fundamentals. These exits usually take place before the fundamental changes since you’re not going to be able to react to the changes in real time and you’ll end up getting front run by algos. Examples of this include taking an exit during an earnings runup or rundown, taking exits before company related news events, or taking an exit before any market-wide news events.

&nbsp;

- **Technical Exits** pertain to any form of exit strategy regarding a chart or an indicator - often a combination of the two. Once I see a pattern or indicator pass a certain threshold, I know it’s likely time to exit my position. Some examples of technical exits may include exits taken around support and resistance levels, exits taken during gap fills, exits taken based off of technical patterns, and exits taken during the absence of any concrete patterns or indicators.

&nbsp;

- **Psychologic Exits** pertain to any form of exit strategy regarding market psychology. This is the simplest of the three categories, and is often used in tandem with the other strategies to provide yourself with the best exit possible. Some strategies include exiting around whole numbers, screenshot theory, and individual gain theory. More on these later.

&nbsp;

Obviously there are going to be a handful of strategies and categories which I’ve missed, but the ones I outlined above are likely going to be the ones which are most common to us retail traders.

&nbsp;

#Fundamental Exits

**Fundamental exits revolve around one key idea - Sell the news.** More often than not, the results of a given news event are already baked into a stock's price well before the news event is confirmed or actually takes place. As a result, the price of a stock will almost always DROP even if this news is “confirmed”, because it was already priced in. This can be observed anywhere from earnings runups to product launches to fundamental news events. You may be wondering why this drop even happens in the first place - if the news is baked into a stock's price, shouldn’t it stay flat when the news is confirmed? Hint : Trading Algorithms.

&nbsp;

Algorithms, or algos for short, are always behind the inevitable tanking of a stock's price post news event. It’s quite easy to see why once you understand how these algorithms work. An algo can read through an entire earnings report / news transcript / whatever and fire off a corresponding trade in a fraction of a nanosecond, meaning that they’re at a huge advantage since they **have the ability to sell the news after the news event hits.** This means that algos don’t have to prematurely exit their position until they confirm that the underlying security was priced properly. If the underlying was priced to perfection, the algo takes its profits once the news confirms it (very common behavior among algos - take profits once there are no longer any catalysts in play), thereby causing the stock to tank. If the instrument wasn’t priced properly, and there is a huge upside beat, the algo just stays in the trade and reaps the rewards, exiting at a later date instead. This concept is pretty difficult to wrap your head around initially, so let's go through an example.

&nbsp;

**In our hypothetical example, let’s say $AAPL has just reported earnings.** 

&nbsp;

**Scenario 1 : $AAPL is priced properly.** The ER comes out, an algo skims it, and confirms that $AAPL was indeed priced properly. The algo then takes its profits (as per common algo behavior), and dumps the position as a result of the priced in ER. Many other algos do the same as well, and the stock price “tanks”, resulting in a gap down the following day, and many left holding the bag, even on a seemingly good ER. Welcome to “priced in”.

&nbsp;

**Scenario 2 : $AAPL is NOT priced properly.** The ER comes out, an algo skims it, and concludes that $AAPL was NOT priced properly. There was a huge upside beat. Instead of selling, the algo stays in the position because it knows that the underlying is undervalued based on the new news, and rides the wave up, exiting the position at a later date. $AAPL was not priced properly, and as a result, the news wasn’t priced in.

&nbsp;

In both cases, the algos win - they either escape with their profits, or ride the wave up for even more gains. **Us humans cannot act as quickly as an algo, and thus we’ll always be at a disadvantage when it comes to fundamental exits. We always have to exit our positions prior to news catalysts to avoid getting front run.** News events are almost ALWAYS priced in. We can’t sell the news AFTER the news drops because we cant digest and react to the news fast enough. We can’t front run the algorithms, so we need to sell BEFORE any fundamental news catalysts, otherwise we run the risk of holding the bag. If there’s one thing I want you all to take away from this article, it's that you should **always sell the news.**

&nbsp;

# Exiting Around Earnings

This is a very simple concept once we understand the mechanisms outlined above. If you’re in a trade, always look to close it out before earnings (unless you wanna get rug pulled, in which case go ahead, I'm not your daddy). If the news is priced in (which it probably is), you’ll get front run by algos and they’ll steal your profits. Do not gamble on the “priced-in“ news being wrong. You’ll lose that bet 9/10 times. Please note that even if earnings is a beat, that “beat” can still be priced in. Please, exit your trades before earnings, or you run the risk of getting blown out due to your own ignorance.

&nbsp;

# Exiting Around Product Launches

This is similar to the concept we outlined above. In this hypothetical example, let’s say $AAPL announces that they’re going to reveal a new line of products in August. If that’s the case, get ready to exit your position before the event. Every August $AAPL showcases their new iPhones for the year, therefore even though they haven’t explicitly said they’re going to reveal iPhones, the market is gonna price the event as if iPhones are going to be revealed. Once they reveal that their new products are in fact iPhones, the price will tank, because it was priced in, and algos followed the exact behavior outlined earlier. The only instance in which the price wouldn’t tank would be if they announced that they’re releasing a teleportation device or something. Believe it or not, the odds of that happening are astronomically low, so you’re better off just selling before the reveal instead. Unless $AAPL comes out with something totally unexpected, the price will drop.

&nbsp;

# Exiting Around Fundamental News Events

This pertains to market moving news as a whole, like an FOMC speech or some macroeconomic event. If you know that JPow is gonna speak on Wednesday, it’s probably best to exit your position before that since you’ve honestly got no idea what’s gonna happen as a byproduct of it. The entire market could take a shit or could fly green, nobody knows. Since we’re traders, not gamblers, it’s in our best interest to exit our positions or hedge in order to shield our gains. Fundamental news events are often crapshoots, and are the leading cause of solid gains getting unjustly erased in an instant.

&nbsp;

---

#Technical Exits

Technical exits pertain to any form of exit strategy regarding a chart or an indicator - often a combination of the two. In order to have the ability to do a technical exit, you must have a basic understanding of technical charts, patterns, and indicators. The entire field of technical analysis is easy to understand, but hard to master, so even if you don’t have much experience in the area, I’ll do my best to explain it all in a way which is friendly towards newer traders.

&nbsp;

---

#Exiting Around Support and Resistance

This is often one of the easiest exits to perform, as it’s fairly straightforward to identify on a chart. **Whenever you start to approach an area which you’ve deemed as a key level of support or resistance, consider exiting your trade.** If the price has bounced off of that particular level five times in the past, it’ll likely hold true for the 6th time unless something has fundamentally changed about the company or the markets. As a result, you know that you should exit your trade as you approach the level, as it likely won’t keep going in the same direction once we get to that point. 

&nbsp;

An awesome example of this would be the [$CLF chart.](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/9/9ymcqFZF.png) As we can tell, CLF trades in a nice ascending channel. In this case, we can use our trendlines to easily identify when to exit our trades in order to capture the maximum amount of our gains, saving us massive headaches. Once we get near any of the yellow trendlines, we should consider taking an exit since we’re likely going to bounce off of it. Another great example of similar price movement can be found in [$AMD’s chart.](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/l/LzNxfKpr.png) It trades off of supports and resistances very consistently, allowing us to bag consistent gains. However, unlike CLF, AMD often has breakouts to the upside or downside, making it trickier to trade in the event of a breakout.

&nbsp;

You may be wondering if there’s any way you can capture the EXTRA gains in the event that the support or resistance levels don’t hold. Although I don’t recommend doing it too often, a well placed stop-loss can help protect your gains in the event that we reject off of a support or resistance, while simultaneously KEEPING you in the trade if we break through the support or resistance. Obviously, you’ll need some experience trading to know exactly where to place your stop, and it’s going to vary from ticker to ticker based on IV and the type of security or derivative you’re trading. A well placed stop-loss can help magnify your returns while also preventing you from giving up any gains you’ve already locked in. Be wary, too tight of a stop could take you out of a trade entirely before a run, but too loose of a stop could cause you to give up too much of your unrealized gains. It’s a fine line to play, and that only comes with experience.

&nbsp;

Another way you could play breakouts is by using a two stepped approach. First, you take your exit once you approach a given level of support or resistance to lock in your gains. You then set an alert within your broker slightly higher than that given level. If your alert gets tripped, you know that there’s been a breakout, and you’re clear to re-enter the trade to then capture any extra gains that may occur once it starts to run. If I run this strategy, I make sure to set my stop under the newly broken support or resistance in order to preserve my capital in the event of a false breakout. In the end, this method is much safer, but it requires you to sit at your computer twiddling your thumbs waiting for a breakout, so I personally don’t prefer it.

&nbsp;

# Exiting Around Gaps

Before we get into how to trade gaps, we need to understand what gaps are, and why they occur. [**Gaps are areas on a chart where the price of a stock moves sharply without any trades being placed.**](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/a/asVEHysx.png) Usually this happens as a result of a positive or negative catalyst affecting a stock outside of regular trading hours, resulting in a respective gap up or down the following day. A “gap” refers to a gap in the stock's price as a result of no trades being conducted within that range. Gaps are created because of low volume (technically no volume), and as a result, are prone to getting “filled” very quickly. Once we are within the price range of a gap, it’s very common that we will get sucked through the area with prices strongly trending towards the opposite side of the gap as a byproduct of the lack of volume.

&nbsp;

When trading gaps, we need to recognize two important levels, and understand how price will act around them. **The very last trade that took place before the gap was created will be a very heavy level of resistance, and the very first trade that takes place after a gap will also be a very heavy level of resistance.** As a result, we will be very prone to rejecting off of these levels, so we want to fully exit our trade around these levels, no exceptions. Once we’re past the initial resistance, we can look to re-enter the trade to capture the rest of our profits.

&nbsp;

Understanding all of that, gap trades are relatively simple. First, we ride our trade up to our first level of resistance (the beginning of the gap, aka the price that the first trade was conducted at), and then take our exit to lock in our profits. Afterwards, we set an alert slightly above the resistance, so we get notified once we’re past the resistance and are in the gap. Since we know there’s no trading volume within the gap, there’s a good chance we will get sucked through to the other side, meaning we should look to re-enter the trade as quickly as possible and then ride it to the opposite end of the gap (the end of the gap aka the price that the last trade was conducted at before the gap was created). Once we get to the opposite end of the gap, we fully exit the trade, because we know that 99% of the time we will reject off of this next heavy level of resistance. Gaps have a very rigid structure, and trade very similar to a breakout play. Enter a trade, exit at first resistance. Re-enter the trade after we break resistance, exit once we’re at the second resistance.

#Clear Skies and Falling Knives

A clear skies situation refers to when a stock is on a tear and has recently carved out new all time highs - think [$AMZN’s recent run to $3750,](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/6/6E9FplY9.png) or [$CRSR’s initial run to $50.](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/e/EHxx1rVZ.png) A falling knife is the flipside of that, and refers to when a stock is essentially in freefall - like $NKLA when people found out Trevor Milton is a rat, or $WKHS when they lost the government contracts. In both situations, it can be extremely difficult to know when you should exit your trade since we don’t have any technical levels to go off of, and as a result, we don’t know when to anticipate a bounce. Even if we did have a general idea of where it was going to bounce, the market often over reacts, resulting in us blowing past our initial mark before starting our initial recovery.

&nbsp;

**The simplest way to play these situations is with a trailing stop.** Trailing stops were invented for situations like these, and they’re honestly one of the most effective yet under-utilized tools. Set the stop, and it’ll trail the stock as it moves. When a stock is carving out new highs, or plunging to new lows, a properly set trailing stop will let you get as close to maximum profits as possible while still allowing you to stay in the trade if we experience some turbulence along the way. If your trailing stop is set properly, you shouldn’t get stopped out of the trade from natural market movements, and will only be forced out once we’ve found a new high or low. I’m not going to teach you how to properly set trailing stops as that’s beyond the scope of this article, but it’s something I may write about in the future given that enough people are interested.

&nbsp;

**Alternatively, if you want to abuse basic human psychology, you could also look to exit your position around whole numbers.** Humans are weird creatures, in the sense that we like “whole” things - stock prices are no exception. You better believe there’s going to be buyers or sellers setting up shop at nice, round numbers. Think $20, $50, $100, etc. If a stock is making a miracle run from $10, and is approaching $20, you better believe there’s going to be a large number of people looking to take profits at the $20 mark, and as a result, you should look to exit the position around there. Again, this isn’t a 100% concrete theory, and sometimes these levels won’t hold at all, but it’s still something to keep in mind. More on this later.

&nbsp;

#Technical Caveats

**Please note, that these technical exits won’t hold true given that a company's underlying fundamentals have changed. A stock's technical charts and indicators are only to be used as a summary of a company's fundamentals.** Technicals summarize the price action which is driven by the underlying fundamentals. If the fundamentals of a company change, the technical indicators and charts will also change, thereby making our old technical charts void. This is an extremely important concept that most traders and investors do not fully understand. Technicals summarize fundamentals.

&nbsp;

If $MSFT announces that they’re coming out with a time machine, don’t expect the stock's price to bounce off of the nearest overhead resistance, as that level is now void. $MSFT has fundamentally changed as a company, and as a result, the technicals will also need to change to reflect that. The same is true to the downside. If $MCD announces that they’ve been grinding up humans and putting them into their hamburgers, don’t expect the nearest level of support to hold - it’s void. The stock will plunge into free fall until $MCD is properly priced given it’s new fundamentals. Only then can we look to start re-establishing our technicals.

&nbsp;

**Technicals are only to be used as a summary of a company’s current fundamentals.**

#Psychological Exits

Psychological exits consist of concepts and rules derived from how humans think and react to certain events. They are more conceptual in nature, and will vary from person to person. They aren’t necessarily as concrete as the other types of exits due to their ambiguous nature. Everyone will apply these exits differently, and as a result I can’t give you a consistent set of rules for each one. I can just explain the general concepts and provide different contexts regarding when to apply them. The rest is up to you!

&nbsp;

#Screenshot Theory

This is a very simple concept that I actually adopted from Wall Street Bets of all places - **If it’s good enough to screenshot, it’s good enough to sell.** If you’re taking screenshots of your unrealized profits to flex on your friends, or random internet people, it’s probably time to sell out of that position. The only reason you feel the need to flex your gains is because it’s a life altering amount of money. I don’t care what the fundamentals, or technicals say at that point. Cash out of the casino, and realize those gains. If it’s good enough to screenshot, it’s good enough to sell.

&nbsp;

# Individual Gain Theory

This concept refers to when you’re trading with money that you cannot afford to lose, and you come in on somewhat of a win. Profit or loss, this money is going to fundamentally alter your life (for better or worse) because you were put in a position where you had to “trade” money which you also needed elsewhere. If you’re ever in a situation where you’re forced to trade to make some extra dough, take those profits asap. A loss is often going to make your life a hell of a lot worse than a win will.

&nbsp;

# Exiting Around Whole Numbers

Humans are weird creatures - we like “whole” or “round” stuff, numbers being no exception. How often do you catch yourself submitting a buy order for 20$, or a sell order for $50. Unless you’re cognizant of it, you’re not going to think to yourself “imma buy $CLF at 21.83”. There’s a good chance you’re gonna round it up to $22, or down to $20, etc. The same goes for literally EVERYONE else. Just keep in mind that depending on the direction you’re trading, there’s often going to be buyers / sellers at whole numbers. $10, $20, $25, $30, etc. No number is safe. Look to time your exits before or after these numbers, as they may prove to be mini points of resistance. You’ll often see sellers step in at whole numbers on the way up, and buyers step in at whole numbers on the way down. Use this to your advantage.

&nbsp;

---

# Emotional Exits

This concept applies to two key emotions - Euphoria and Hope. **The instant you start feeling euphoric about a trade and it’s potential gains, step away from the trade.** You’re not going to be thinking clearly enough to make an optimal trade or exit. There’s a very high chance you’re going to continue to chase the victory. If the victory starts slipping away from you, you're likely going to stay in the trade hoping that it goes back up to the previous high that you didn’t sell at. In situations like this, by staying in the trade, you’ll almost always hold your position well past the top, and will be prone to “diamond hands-ing” your profits into the ground, ultimately coming up with a loss on a fundamentally sound trade. 

&nbsp;

You need to be conscious of the fact that you’re euphoric, and that this trade went awesome, and exit the position intelligently. Once you start feeling euphoria, and consequently hope, there’s no going back. You’re not trading on fundamentals, and you’re not trading on technicals either. You’re simply not trading rationally. In situations like this, it’s best to take a step back and exit the trade before you make a boneheaded move and end up giving your gains away. Emotions cloud judgement, and as traders, that’s the last thing we want. Sell out of a position once you start feeling intense emotion.

&nbsp;

#Conclusion

All in all, options trading is a difficult game with many moving parts - If you're caught skimping on your exits, you’re gonna be kneecapping your gains on a regular basis. This aspect of trading is less glamorous and often overlooked, but is absolutely vital to your success as a trader. I hope this writeup was informative and useful to you all! **If you want some more in depth explanations of each concept, alongside some detailed examples, refer to my Options Trading Exit Strategies video, which you can find [here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDKNRF_BZqQ)** If you have any questions, feel free to drop em below and I'll do my best to help you out!

https://jobs.dish.com/jobs/79298?lang=en-us

Looks like this is actually going to happen 🚀

------

Lot's of rumours over the past 4 months on this partnership. It was originally supposed to be announced in June 2023, but could come as early as this month (July 2023).

**TL;DR** = $AMZN would create more loyalty for Prime customers and $DISH (currently the 4th largest wireless carrier after $T $VZ $TMUS) would instantly gain customers. $DISH has like 8 Million customers vs $T with 223 Million customers.

It would instantly transform $DISH overnight to become serious wireless player and allow $AMZN to chip away at the big 3. $DISH also recently said they now cover 70% of the USA with their 5G service.

**Unlimited 5G data for $10, $15, $25 for Amazon Prime members? YES PLEASE!**  💣💥

Look at what happened to mobile data prices in Europe when low cost carriers came to the market and the incumbents were forced to compete with lower prices.

This would be a massive gamechanger move in a sector that NEED disrupting!🔥

With the report [last month](https://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/amazon-reportedly-talks-sell-phone-service-part-prime) that Amazon is in talks to offer a low-cost or free nationwide mobile phone service to Prime subscribers, all eyes suddenly turned to Dish. Dish shares jumped 18% following the news, while shares of Verizon, T-Mobile and AT&T all dropped. (After this story published, Amazon reached out wanting to clarify that Amazon, Verizon and T-Mobile have all denied the rumor that was reported by Bloomberg on June 2. Dish declined to comment. This Industry Voices article is speculation by one industry analyst.)

## Prime Wireless, powered by Dish?

What had the markets so excited about a potentially transformative tie-up? In a word: timing. The timing could not be more perfect for Dish and Amazon to make each other an offer they can’t refuse, and for consumers to break away from the retail environment of the big three carriers. Wireless networks, like any other facilities-based business, are monetized through their use and in order to thrive, they need vast numbers of users consuming throughput.

Despite [declining retail customer adoption](https://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/dish-drops-another-210k-wireless-subs-2q), Dish’s wireless efforts to date to field a nationwide 5G network have [just passed 70% coverage](https://about.dish.com/2023-06-15-The-DISH-5G-Network-is-Now-Available-to-Over-70-Percent-of-the-U-S-Population) of the U.S. population and the company has built much of the infrastructure and institutional knowledge necessary to power a nationwide network rollout – but only if they can start realizing the benefits of owner economics.

Meanwhile, Amazon, with its giant built-in ecosystem of loyal customers, effortless purchasing and its ability to cross-collateralize ultra-cheap, or even free, wireless service, could be just the catalyst to make that mass customer migration possible. In fact, according to the latest J.D. Power data on wireless customer loyalty, 37% of current wireless customers say they selected their carrier based on price.

Among Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) customers, that rate jumps to 69%. Put another way, 6 in 10 wireless customers of the kind ultimately served by AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon through flanker or other brands like Metro, Cricket and Consumer Cellular are at risk of conquest by a radical Dish/Amazon combo offer.

## Wireless customers hungry for an alternative

Consider the variables at play: a macroeconomic environment of sky-high inflation where everything feels too expensive and everyone is looking to find ways to cut costs. A ubiquitous digital giant that already has deep customer relationships with nearly every consumer in the country. A hungry and financially motivated outsider that has been plotting a move like this for years. Something new and different in a sea of same. Could these be the beginning of the thread that forces the big three into a model that looks more like what streamers have done to the video subscribers count of cable TV?   

While a union of Dish and Amazon does make a lot of sense from a timing and incentivization perspective, those factors alone would not necessarily ensure its success – many strategic partnerships have seemed like perfect fits before fizzling out. What makes this potential pairing so intriguing is its clear path to success. Customers already appear to be willing to break free of the big three carriers if the price is right, and that sentiment will only grow stronger if the low-cost carrier is associated with a brand they know and already trust.

Beyond the widespread interest among consumers in switching wireless providers for lower cost alternatives, [eSIM technology](https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/esim-cards-faq) has made it even easier for customers to become carrier agnostic. Without physical SIM cards tying customers to the carrier-specific phones, an Amazon/Dish partnership could easily employ a “try it, you’ll like it” strategy deployed through its app to onboard customers in the short-term while angling to retain them for the long haul, all while offering complimentary trials of Amazon/Dish services to boot. Now, what if those prospects were offered to try a Dish-powered wireless network with an Amazon gift card as a kicker?

Amazon has another ace up its sleeve: its existing mesh network. Amazon has already tried to seamlessly connect various customer devices through mesh networks with [Amazon Sidewalk](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/everything-you-need-to-know-about-amazon-sidewalk). Supercharging this connectivity with wireless access network enables a near-term future where a customer’s Alexa and Echo devices boost the Dish 5G cell phone service with Wi-Fi backhaul. Amazon’s personal assistant devices are already so ubiquitous that device connectivity would likely be seamless. Forget about more cell towers in residential neighborhoods – an inexpensive phone with an Amazon network that could get signal boosts in bad-reception areas of the house would be incentive enough for plenty of customers to switch. 

Perhaps most importantly, that’s two massive, double-digit billion-dollar infrastructure investments (owning an ISP, and building a physical wireless network/acquiring spectrum) that Amazon either already has or doesn’t have to undertake in order to enter and compete in this space.

## Where do we go from here?

While Dish likely sees any deal between itself and Amazon as a “2024 event,” according to Chairman Charlie Ergen, it’s hard to deny that the market conditions make a deal getting done in the near-term a logical conclusion. Two of the big three wireless providers are already vulnerable. Between lagging financial performance, executive shake ups and customer loyalty becoming more and more fleeting, there’s never been a better time for Amazon and Dish to make a big move. And if it happens, it has a chance to send ripple effects throughout the wireless and retail spaces.

Not everyone agrees, of course. AT&T CFO Pascal Desroches, for one, recently [downplayed](https://www.lightreading.com/broadband/atandt-cfo-likens-amazon-mobile-rumor-to-seinfeld-/d/d-id/785359) the likelihood of an Amazon foray into wireless, saying: “It’s sort of like those of you who watch Seinfeld. It’s a show about nothing. This was a rumor about nothing.”

To Desroches point, many crucial details – like what effect a deal would have on the price of Prime, what infrastructure would need to be enhanced to handle a vast and unexpectedly quick subscriber increase, how device retailers would be incorporated (or wound down – Amazon is among the largest seller of mobile phones on the planet) – will have to be ironed out. But this could be a deal that makes too much sense to dismiss completely. One way or another, Amazon is likely to come ([back](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_Phone)) to wireless faster than you can say, “one-click purchase,” and that could be enough to finally lead Dish to the promised land, too.

Apple vs Verizon - The Satellite Communications Race,20,1ddpuwr,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ddpuwr/apple_vs_verizon_the_satellite_communications_race/,10,2024-06-12 03:05:42,"Verizon Communications Inc [NYSE:VZ] partnered with AST SpaceMobile [NASDAQ:ASTS] last month. The ASTS stock has jumped more than 300% in the last month.

Within the partnership, AST SpaceMobile will enhance cellular connectivity for users in the US. Along with the partnership from Verizon, AST SpaceMobile also received financial backing from Google, AT&T and Vodafone Group.

Safe to say that Apple anticipated this coming years ago. The Multinational tech giant partnered with another Globalstar, Inc [NYSE:GSAT] in 2022.

How can retail investors take advantage of these power moves in the satellite communications race between Apple and Verizon?

ASTS stock is trading above $9 per share. Even with the recent price surge, it’s still very affordable. GSAT is still in penny stock territory, just over $1 a share.

After introducing the lastest Apple Intelligence in the iOS 18 scheduled to debut this fall, expect GSAT shares to increase steadily throughout Q3 and Q4.

SEC Extended 1st Quarter Reporting by 45 Days,263,fswdx8,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fswdx8/sec_extended_1st_quarter_reporting_by_45_days/,84,2020-04-01 14:46:43,"SEC  extends deadline to provide certain disclosures, such as earnings, by 45 days, so MarketWatch asked all 30 Dow components their plans.  The Securities and Exchange Commission  will allow companies to delay reporting earnings, if needed, but that doesn't mean any of them will.  The  SEC  said last week that [it would extend the deadline](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-74) for companies to provide certain disclosure reports by 45 days, given business disruptions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The companies requesting delays just have to provide a summary of why an extension is needed for each report, the  SEC  said. Read [MarketWatch's Coronavirus update](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/coronavirus-update-803650-cases- 39033-deaths-and-white-house-expected-to-release-models-showing-trajectory-of-illness-2020-03-31).  Some of the companies within the Dow Jones Industrial Average have already issued press releases stating when their earnings reports will be released. But as many companies have withdrawn financial guidance, given difficulties in assessing the potential impact of the coronavirus health crisis, they can still look to push back releasing those reports.  Don't miss: First-half earnings are a bust as coronavirus stops companies in their tracks. Will the second-half be better? [It depends](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/first-half-earnings-are-a-bust-as-coronavirus-stops-companies-in- their-tracks-will-the-second-half-be-better-it-depends-2020-03-26).

Puts on $LWLG: hedge fund managed share selling scam on a do-nothing company,64,rfn1yq,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rfn1yq/puts_on_lwlg_hedge_fund_managed_share_selling/,84,2021-12-14 00:24:36,"Hello fuckers,

Today I want to introduce you to another shitco on which luckily you can buy shitputs.

Brief intro about myself: I'm a retard like you all, but when I don't waste hours [making video memes](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r8eboq/brief_recap_of_todays_market_action/), I sometimes write [killer DD on shitcos](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q7i6ot/hudson_bay_capital_hedge_fund_pulling_off_a_scam/), with extra focus on hedge fund managed scams. If you were smart enough to figure out the company (couldn't post the name of the company due to the 1.5B$ market cap rule - solution in the comments), you could have shorted or bought put at virtually any strike/expiration and made some honest money.

For the next one, fortunately, the ticker has been pumped enough to cross the WSB threshold! As I write this, the company is trading at a market cap north of 2B$. In case you missed the title, today's shitco is:

# $LWLG

The company has been around since 1991, public since 2006, and named Lightwave Logic since 2008. For what they claim, the company focuses on the ""development of photonic devices"" or whatever else. But let's dig a little bit deeper into their business.

Throughout this DD, I'll include info I found myself, as well as some from the SA report of:

\- Gold Panda (GP): Lightwave Logic Looks Overvalued Based On Fundamentals

\- White Diamond Research (WDR): Lightwave Logic Is A Tiny, Glorified Science Lab, Recent 500%+ Runup Is Without Substance

I can't link them due to Reddit rules, but I recommend you have a look especially at WDR, excellent work on what a trash company this is.

**So, you may ask, what does this company sell?**

Their revenue is consistently zero. This has been the case for at least 10 years (thanks WDR). If anyone has the patience, you're welcome to look for more zeroes in the past. 11 years ago, someone posted a junk article on SA, claiming:

>For the last 7 years or so a small company named Lightwave Logic (LWLG) has been developing a new electro optical polymer material (EO polymer) that promises increased life for Moore’s Law.

So, they started developing this stuff 18 years ago, and still have to sell anything. This is getting comical, to the point that of their 70+ patents and applications, some are [so old they'll soon expire](https://patents.google.com/?assignee=lightwave+logic&oq=lightwave+logic&sort=old).

[Cumulative sales of LWLG's core product](https://preview.redd.it/uplh6n88wc581.png?width=1830&format=png&auto=webp&s=32f56b2520869d69792dcb0fc1d4bf2acd5bb1cb)

Their main product are shares. They [sell millions of them every year](https://ycharts.com/companies/LWLG/shares_outstanding) to their customers/bagholders, who are in turn rewarded with a [constant flow of PRs](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LWLG?p=LWLG) talking about the next investor conferences, their latest ""breakthrough"" or some award at random events they are attending.

**Ok, but how did they do a +2,000% YTD?**

There must be something behind such a rally, right? Not really, except stock promotion. This appears to be happening with the blessing of $LWLG itself, as it all started with them [casually showing logos of companies](https://youtu.be/rcY5vhsWHKo?t=381) to which they ""planned to sell components"" mid-this year. These included the likes of $CSCO, Huawei, $NOK, and why not let's also throw in the logos of $AMZN, $GOOG and $VZ.

[A few companies that have no interest in LWLG's products](https://preview.redd.it/vanascdbwc581.png?width=945&format=png&auto=webp&s=03c8797288e4b261c19fff59d8c123d24e3f1b07)

You can probably tell from $LWLG revenue how much interest there is from these companies to buy their products.

Fun stuff, looking at the YouTube account that posted this (likely an employee), I found [this gem in a March 2017 presentation](https://youtu.be/U60ijsAC70s?t=662).

>The market is ready for our solution: it's scalable...and we have great timing  
>  
>Our technology platform is exactly what customers are looking for...

This was happening 4 and a half years ago. Great timing.

The stock has undergone a promotion campaign by [https://insiderfinancial.com/](https://insiderfinancial.com/) (through its website, twitter and youtube), which is famous for promoting OTC stock scams. A penny stock boiler room basically.

**What's the thing with the hedge fund?**

There's this hedge fund called [Lincoln Park Capital](https://www.lpcfunds.com/). According to them, they are a:

>Chicago-based *Investment* Group and Asset Management Firm focused on opportunistic investing in public and private companies

Not so surprisingly, one of the first suggestions when typing it on google is ""Lincoln Park Capital pump and dump"". Their main business is signing agreements to purchase shares from shitcos, and then dumping them on retail bagholders. [Utopia Capital Research](https://utopiacap.com/lincoln-park-capital/?amp) took some time to go through a series of their pump and dumps, pointing out that such stocks have horrific yearly returns of -42%.

(side note: considering going short the whole LPC scam portfolio)

Fortunately, we don't need to worry about $LWLG finances:

[The intern preparing these slides forgot they shouldn't mention it](https://preview.redd.it/p1kkqrffwc581.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=d2bafd6485f127362c620cc785be839ce2bc4b61)

Their [previous pump and dump agreement](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2019/01/22/1703512/0/en/Lightwave-Logic-Inc-Secures-25MM-Common-Stock-Purchase-Agreement-with-Longstanding-Investor-Lincoln-Park-Capital-Fund-LLC.html) was for 25M$. [The latest one](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lightwave-logic-announces-33-0-million-financing-agreement-with-lincoln-park-capital-fund-301395039.html) came in on Oct. 7th. Following a few weeks of nothing, the stock price has suddenly started flying on no news. This is somewhat unusual, as LPC has the right to purchase shares at $9.16 (we are north of $18 now). Such agreements are typically very bearish, since they put the market buyer in a position of disadvantage. Wash sales? Stock promotion? I don't know.

But who knows, maybe LPC is genuinely investing in $LWLG, holding shares for the long run? That would fit well with their mission, as stated in their website:

>long-term, win-win relationships where Lincoln Park incentives are aligned with the best interests of common shareholders

Well, as you may have guessed, no chance on earth. A look at the [ownership structure as of Sep. 29th](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LWLG/holders?p=LWLG) reveals as much as 1.45% of the shares are held by institutions. LPC doesn't appear to be in the top 10, meaning they own less than 37k shares. I can see your shocked face expression.

It's also interesting to note that insiders appear to own 0.74% of the shares outstanding. Talk about having skin in the game.

Can it get worse? Of course! $LWLG recently got into bed with H.C. Wainwright. This is another shit company that pumps junk stocks and then hits them with a share offering. Also, they're a larger player than LPC, and when they dump shares, they dump like there's no fucking tomorrow. I've previously fallen for some recommended by their analysts (Azurx biopharma and Eyegate pharmaceuticals, both renamed into other shit this year), which promptly turned out to be trash and were hit with an offering. In this case as well, a google search can help confirming HCW's great reputation for scams.

[$LWLG recently went to one of their scam conferences](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lightwave-logic-present-h-c-014800849.html). Wouldn't be surprised if an offering is coming in the next few months.

**Sounds like a solid investment so far, anything else?**

The management is either retarded or lying to shareholders. They state in their [most recent corporate update](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lightwave-logic-provides-third-quarter-133100829.html):

>As of November 15, 2021, the Company's cash and cash equivalents are approximately $15 million, enabling it to finance operations through March 2023.

For the last two quarters, cash burn was north of 4M$. At the current rate, their reserves should run to zero some time between June and September 2022.

**Why should I buy puts now?**

There's an event hosted by Oppenheimer tomorrow, at which [$LWLG will give a presentation starting at 10:45](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lightwave-logic-present-december-investor-133100984.html). Some dumbfucks on Twitter/stocktwits ([here just an example](https://twitter.com/atlsutiger/status/1468931900630880257)) believe they will announce a foundry partnership. It would sound somewhat improbable to me, considering they have participated in hundreds of these conferences, and consistently announced zero such things.

If the run-up is caused by retail investors interest, this may come crashing once the presentation turns out to be the usual nothing burger. If it's just wash sales, LPC could rugpull.

If you feel adventurous enough to bet on the presentation, based on all the shit you've read so far, there's puts for Dec. 17th (this Friday), which should well satisfy your gambling desires. If you typically hang out on r/investing, but somehow ended up today here on WSB, there's some for June 17th, 2022. By then, they would likely have started dumping shares.

**IMPORTANT UPDATE: HUGE VOLUME IN DEC 17 17.5-20 PUTS**

Had the brilliant idea of checking out the options volume for basically all the puts in existence. Turns out on Dec. 8th somebody purchased in a single order [\~500x 17.5 puts](https://finance.yahoo.com/chart/LWLG211217P00017500#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) (premium: 1.1-1.3), and [\~900x 20.0 puts](https://finance.yahoo.com/chart/LWLG211217P00020000#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) (premium: 2.45).

Also interesting, the orders are typically executed around 2pm, both days.

We are talking about a total of \~350k$ in put options expiring in a week, which is not something one would throw in the wind for the fuck of it. This could be an indicator of an upcoming short report. Last time I've seen the exact same thing happening, it was with another shitco called Moxian (now below WSB threshold). Premium spent in puts was also in the 100ks order. Tried to check the usual suspects (Hindenburg, Muddy Waters and Scorpion Capital but haven't seen much hints.

And yeah, I wish that was me, but I doubt IBKR would be happy giving me 10x leverage on 1 week options.

**Can I somehow get fucked?**

Of course! And you likely will! Timing the market is notoriously impossible. All these elaborate hypotheses could be invalidated if $LWLG announces a revenue-generating partnership, LPC decides starting tomorrow they'll hold all the shares they're buying, or whatever else.

Not financial advice and all the usual crap. Hasta la vista and see you in valhalla.

*Position: nothing but puts, with expirations Dec.-June and strike 10-17.5.*

tl;dr : fuck $LWLG and Lincoln Park Capital"

* **Historical Move v Implied Move:** We determine the historical volatility (log variance of daily gains) of the underlying asset and compare that to the current implied volatitlity (IV) of the option price. This is used to determine the Call or Put Premium associated with the pricing of options (implied volatility).
* **Priced Move:** given the current option prices, how much in dollar amounts will the underlying have to move to make the call/put break even. This is how much vol the option is pricing in. The expected move.
* **Expiration:** 2023-05-12.
* **Call/Put Premium:** How much extra you are paying for the implied move relative to the historic move. Low numbers mean options are ""cheaper."" High numbers mean options are ""expensive.""
* **Efficiency:** This factor represents the bid/ask spreads and the depth of the order book relative to the price of the option. It represents how much traders will pay in slippage with a round trip trade. Lower numbers are less efficient than higher numbers.

US Treasury Department RIGGED Data to Keep Long-Term Yield Down,7,1aeukdb,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1aeukdb/us_treasury_department_rigged_data_to_keep/,15,2024-01-30 23:23:16," Fellow Regards! Some simple lessons before we move on

1. Demand High, Supply Low → Prices go up
2. Demand Low, Supply High → Prices go down
3. Yield (rate) and price are inverse of each other. If one goes up, the other goes down

According to Wolf Ritcher, the reason for the surge in long-term (think 10 years or longer) treasury yield last quarter Q4 2023 was because the US Treasury Department “at the beginning of August that it would issue a tsunami of longer-term Treasury notes and bonds. Then three months later, at the beginning of November, the Treasury Department attempted to undo some of the damage” by stating it will issue short-term T-Bills instead.

Today, they said that not just that but they will borrow even less than estimated. This is pure BS as their own number tells us that they lied about how much they borrowed in Q3 and Q4. How can we trust their future numbers if they underestimate the borrowing? 

&#x200B;

[Surprise Surprise the US government lies to US!   Source: Wolfstreet.com](https://preview.redd.it/m6m4kv2q7mfc1.png?width=866&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce3546790713a88f8ccef8270bd0af47352b7e9c)

So why does all this matter? Well the proposed, phantom interest rate cuts are coming soon said Wall Street but that only affects short-term treasury yield. The long-term treasury yields are determined by supply and demand. Right now, with QT, demand is low while supply is high. So based on the lesson above, the prices must go down which means yield must goes up. However, Janet “The Felon” Yellen has convinced the markets that supply is low while demand is high. This causes prices to go up and yield (rate) go down. 

Here are some facts about life.

1. You will eventually die. No one lives forever. 
2. You will always pay taxes. Yes even the regard with 50k losses 
3. The US government will always spend like drunken sailors 

Do you think the US government will act fiscal responsibility this year? We are at a time where the National Debt will increase $1 Trillion every 3 months or less, and that debts must be rollover. When long-term interest rate was 1.6%, Janet “The Felon” Yellen did not lock in those rates. Yes, even regards here with mortgages while YOLOing into meme stocks were smart enough to lock in 30 years fixed at 2% or 3%. The US Treasury, with its infinite wisdom, decided to issue short-term T-Bills instead! This is like a WSB play. Now those T-Bills mature and unless they stop spending beyond their means, they must rollover all those debts at a much HIGHER interest rate! So what will happen next? 

Interest rate will stay around 4% until the people finally wise enough to know the truth! At this point, long-term yield will surge again. As the long-end goes higher, the short-end will come down or even stay the same (depending if the FED chicken out and cut rates), but the ultimate outcome is the yield curves UN-invert. This probably will happen in the summertime. When this happens, a recession will occur in 6 - 12 months. If my prediction is correct, there will be no recession this year which BTW is an election year.

I’m sick of watching all of these “huurrr NOK is 5G so it should be $5” posts. Here is the real reason NOK and ERIC are going to the moon 🌙 🚀

https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-begins-major-5g-spectrum-auction

The FCC gave the dick to Intelsat and jacked their spectrum allocation called the C-Band and is now auctioning it off to telecom companies. Now, I know when I say spectrum and C-Band you think I’m talking about what you are on and your grades in community college but stay with me. The C-Band is the best spectrum for telecos because it’s faster then lower frequency 4G spectrums, with an up to 1.5 gig potential download speed, but can still penetrate objects, unlike higher frequency spectrum bands and your micropeen.

The telcos are bidding like fuck on this either because they are so far behind on spectrum ownership (VZ, T) or because they want to fuck over the other guys (TMUS). At the end of the day, it doesn’t matter because this auction is literally dropping another T-Mobile of spectrum capacity into the laps of the telcos.

So what do you retards thing is going to happen after the auction? After touching tips with their bankers for more loans, the telcos are going on a capex binge to build out their networks with 5G-enabled equipment. And who do you think they’re going to buy it from, Huawei?

TLDR: The FCC gave the telcos $80 billion of autism and now they they want to buy new toys. 🚀 🚀 🚀

What's on everyone's radar for today's trading day ahead here at r/wallstreetbets?

*****

# **I hope you all have an excellent trading day ahead today on this Wednesday, April 1st, 2020! :)**"
AT&T warns that customers are starting to fall behind on their bills.,98,w4x5dk,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/w4x5dk/att_warns_that_customers_are_starting_to_fall/,37,2022-07-22 06:32:47,"(The Wall Street Journal) -- AT&T Inc. said more of its customers are starting to fall behind on their bills, a sign that rising costs are pinching many households even for services most Americans consider essential.

The wireless giant logged another customer surge in its latest quarter after smartphone promotions helped it lure new clients and keep existing ones. But subscribers were paying their monthly phone and internet bills on average two days slower than a year earlier, executives said.

“We do see in times of economic stress customers managing their payments more tightly,” Pascal Desroches, AT&T’s finance chief, said in an interview.

Rising interest rates and higher prices on everything from gas to groceries this year has pressured consumer sentiment even as consumer spending has largely held up. Some CEOs, including leaders at PepsiCo Inc. and United Airlines Holdings Inc., have warned in recent weeks that they expect a spending slowdown this year and see a higher chance of an economic recession.

Speaking on a conference call with analysts Thursday, AT&T Chief Executive John Stankey stopped short of predicting a new recession, calling the business environment “not easy to predict,” but said that the company was prepared to respond to one. Inflation has burdened AT&T with higher costs for equipment while some of its customers struggle with more expensive household basics.

“I hate to describe it this way, but I think we got a little bit of a tale of two cities going on here, and when you see 9% inflation, it tends to hit those in the low-end of the market really really hard,” Mr. Stankey said.

Those pressures did little to curb AT&T’s growth during the June quarter. The telecom company reported a net gain of 813,000 postpaid phone connections in the June quarter, topping the average 400,000-phone projection from Wall Street analysts polled by FactSet.

Investors tend to watch postpaid wireless plans, which charge customers for monthly service after it is rendered, to gauge a cellphone carrier’s core growth.

The gains came at a cost as promotions, capital investments and late payments from customers sapped the amount of cash generated by the business. AT&T lowered its 2022 target for free cash flow and its shares dropped about 10% early Thursday.

The fact that wireless subscriptions still rose suggested that many AT&T customers were willing to absorb the rate changes despite surging prices for other household expenses such as food and fuel. Verizon is scheduled to post its second-quarter results Friday, followed by T-Mobile US Inc. next week.

The new mobile customers helped AT&T raise its estimate of this year’s wireless service revenue growth to between 4.5% and 5%, above its earlier forecast of 3% or better. Smartphone promotions have attracted droves of customers to AT&T’s main business over the past two years, allowing the company to sometimes outrun fast-growing T-Mobile.

The company lowered its 2022 free cash flow target by $2 billion to $14 billion, citing “working capital impacts and higher subscriber growth.” Some of that decrease came from its offers on new smartphones, which made the company spend more cash up front to grab valuable long-term customers. Customers making later account payments accounted for about $1 billion of the cast flow decrease.

The company generated $4.2 billion in free cash from its operations in the first half of the year, and now expects to generate about $10 billion in the second half to meet its revised target. The cash flow feeds AT&T’s dividend, which costs the company about $8 billion a year.

Mr. Desroches said the altered cash-flow goal largely reflected the timing of payments rather than the revenue they represent. The cash AT&T paid to hand customers new smartphones over the holiday season came due as much as a quarter and a half later, he said. But those subscribers must pay off the devices through service plans lasting as long as three years, allowing the carrier to recoup its spending on devices.

“Look, these are good problems to have because obviously you have an upfront investment but you’re getting an attractive return on the lifetime value of the customer,” Mr. Desroches said in an interview. “We still grew better than our expectations.”

Customers also took two days longer on average to pay their bills than they did a year ago, extending the cash-flow lag. Mr. Desroches said it was too early to tell the specific reasons customers were paying late but said levels of bad debt—receivables the company doesn’t expect to get at all—remained low.

# **Stocks face headwinds as investors look forward to a big earnings week, a Fed meeting and state reopenings  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/24/stocks-face-headwinds-as-investors-look-forward-to-a-big-earnings-week-a-fed-meeting-and-state-reopenings.html)**
*****
> The stock market is struggling to make headway, as a big week of events rolls around, including a Federal Reserve meeting, the first look at post-shutdown economic growth and earnings from more than a fifth of the S&P 500 companies.
*****
> It’s a busy week for earnings, and some of the biggest blue chips are likely to join the growing list of companies withdrawing guidance amid the uncertainty of how the coronavirus and shutdowns are impacting their business. Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, Boeing and McDonald’s are among about 140 S&P 500 companies reporting first quarter results.
*****
> Investors will also be watching the progress of the reopening of business activity in some states, like Georgia, Texas, Oklahoma and South Carolina. At the same time, President Donald Trump said he may extend social distancing guidelines into early summer. Many states, including the hardest hit, remain completely shut down.
*****
> Stocks were higher Friday, but the major indices had their first negative week in three as oil prices cratered and then steadied in the mid-teens. The S&P 500 has been trading on both sides of the key 2,800 level, as investors focused on murky corporate outlooks and uncertainty surrounding the timing of the reopening of the economy. Even though several states are resuming some activities, Trump said he disagreed with Georgia’s plan to reopen.
*****
> On Friday, the S&P closed at 2,836, down 1.3% for the week.
*****
> Earnings for the first quarter have been bleak so far, down about 14% based on estimates and actual reports, according to Refinitiv. Second quarter results are expected to be far worse, declining 32.2%.
*****
> “If you take a look where the real battle is in the market, it’s a fundamental story,” said Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse. “The fundamentals are that the market should be lower, and on the other hand, the Fed is kind of putting their thumb on the scale in favor of the market.”
*****
> Golub said it’s the potential for recurrences of the outbreak that’s being watched to see if businesses can remain open once they start back up. “People are watching what’s going on in places like Georgia, but they’re also watching what’s going on in Singapore and places in Asia that are opening up,” he said. “At the end of the day, there’s really one thing that really matters. It’s not the Fed. The virus is going to own the agenda, whether we want it to or not.”
*****
> # Fed bazooka
> The Fed meets Tuesday and Wednesday, and while it’s not expected to take any new action, it will likely discuss the many programs it quickly rolled out to support the economy and provide liquidity.
*****
> “I’m anticipating no actions in terms of anything with purchases or interest rate movements,” said Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust. “I think we’re going to hear a lot more in terms of their description of what’s working and the things that still need to happen.”
*****
> Tilley said the Fed’s job is also to instill confidence, and its asset purchase and other programs to support mortgages, corporate credit and municipal bonds, helped bring back in spreads that had been widening out across the credit markets. “It looked like we were headed for a seizure in credit markets, but they’ve come back in,” he said, adding he expects the Fed to also discuss programs like its support for the small business lending program.
*****
> Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is also expected to sound optimistic about the central bank’s ability to help the economy, despite the uncertainty as the economy falls into an unprecedented decline in the second quarter. Tilley said he expects the economy to contract in the second quarter by 40%.
*****
> Golub said this Fed meeting isn’t as important as others have been, since the central bank has already taken so many extraordinary policy steps and promises to do more as needed.
*****
> “The Fed has made it clear if they need to provide liquidity to the market, they’re not going to wait for a meeting to do it,” he said. “Whether you’re borrowing from a bank or whether you’re borrowing in the capital markets, that capital is available so the economy can move ... the net effect is it also pushes the stock market up.”
*****
> # Economic impact
> First quarter gross domestic product numbers are expected Wednesday, and it will be the first look at how the early weeks of the shutdown impacted the broader economy. Forecasts are wide ranging, and the consensus forecast from Refinitiv is now for a contraction of 4.1%. Economists expect the second quarter to take the biggest hit of the recession, and it is forecast by many to show a contraction of more than 30%.
*****
> Some of the early second-quarter data will be released in the coming week. Vehicle sales slowed to a trickle in April, and auto makers shut down production.
*****
> The impact of that should show up in Friday’s April vehicle sales and ISM manufacturing, but the single-most important data point will be Thursday’s weekly jobless claims, expected again to show millions of workers signed up for unemployment benefits.
*****
> So far, 26.5 million unemployment claims have been filed in the last five weeks, wiping out all the job gains made since the end of the Great Recession. The employment report for April will be released on May 8, and economists say unemployment will likely peak in April or May before falling off.
*****
> “We’ll probably see an unemployment rate at 20% or a little higher,” Tilley said.
*****
> # Earnings
> Earnings reports are expected from a range of industries, such as tech, health care, energy and defense. Merck, Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Humana and Anthem are among health care names reporting. Big oil companies, Exxon Mobil and Chevron both release results on Friday, and their comments on how they are reacting to the shocking decline in crude oil prices this past week will be important.
*****
> An oil futures contract for May dove into negative territory Monday and Tuesday, as did prices in many spot markets. That contract expired Tuesday, and the June futures contract for West Texas Intermediate settled at $16.94 per barrel Friday, down about 7.3% for the week and about $5 lower than the price of Brent futures.
*****
> “The most important earnings story is not what happens this quarter, It’s how long does it take to get back to peak earnings again,” said Golub. “My estimate is this is going to take three years to get back to peak profits. But the estimates right now are reflecting that it’s going to turn back to normal by something closer to the third quarter of next year. I think that’s too optimistic.The second part of the earnings story is how fast estimates are coming down.”
*****
> He said first quarter earnings per share look to be down a little more than 12%, though some estimates have them down 16% or 17%. “We had 10 very healthy weeks and three not healthy weeks. The fact you could have such a negative quarter with only three bad week, that’s really bad.” Golub said. His forecast is for a 40% decline in second quarter profits.

# Election-year Mays: DJIA’s Second Worst Month

> May officially marks the beginning of the “Worst Six Months” for the DJIA and S&P. To wit: “Sell in May and go away.” Our “Best Six Months Switching Strategy,” created in 1986, proves that there is merit to this old trader’s tale. A hypothetical $10,000 investment in the DJIA compounded to a gain of $1,068,826 for November-April in 69 years compared to just $1,461 for May-October. The same hypothetical $10,000 investment in the S&P 500 compounded to $823,326 for November-April in 69 years compared to a gain of just $9,537 for May-October.

> May has been a tricky month over the years, a well-deserved reputation following the May 6, 2010 “flash crash”. It used to be part of what we called the “May/June disaster area.” From 1965 to 1984 the S&P 500 was down during May fifteen out of twenty times. Then from 1985 through 1997 May was the best month, gaining ground every single year (13 straight gains) on the S&P, up 3.3% on average with the DJIA falling once and two NASDAQ losses.

> In the years since 1997, May’s performance has been erratic; DJIA up eleven times in the past twenty-two years (three of the years had gains in excess of 4%). NASDAQ suffered five May losses in a row from 1998-2001, down – 11.9% in 2000, followed by twelve sizable gains in excess of 2.5% and five losses, the worst of which was 8.3% in 2010. Election Year Mays rank at or near the bottom, registering net losses on DJIA and S&P 500 (since 1952), NASDAQ (since 1972) and Russell 1000 and 2000 (since 1980).

# LPL Office Talk: Putting The Rally In Perspective

> One month ago today the S&P 500 Index bottomed after a vicious bear market. Was this the ultimate bottom? We’ll have to wait and see, but what we do know is the rally we’ve seen over the past month is nearly as historic as the drop coming into it was.

> “We recently had the best 20-day rally for the S&P 500 since March 2009 and one of the best ever,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Looking back at the previous best 20-day rallies, one thing is consistent: very strong returns going out a year.”

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the 10 previous best 20-day rallies for the S&P 500 saw continued gains after some near-term volatility. In fact, six months later stocks were higher 9 of 10 times and a full year later higher 10 of 10 times.

# Why The Recent Strength Has Bulls Smiling

> The huge equity rally continued last week, with the S&P 500 Index up another 3%, on the heels of adding more than 15% in the previous week. The gain during the past two weeks of 15.5% was the greatest since October 1974. Taking it a step further, the 15 trading days ending April 14 saw the S&P 500 up more than 27%, one of the greatest rallies ever. What we’ve been seeing is truly historic, so the big question now is: What could happen next?

> “This remarkable rally has caught most off guard, but what might surprise many to hear is more gains could eventually be in store in 2020,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “When we’ve seen similar blasts of extreme short-term strength, stocks have been quite strong going out 6- to 12-months.”

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&P 500 was up nine of 10 times six months later and higher every single time a year later after the previous best 15-day gains ever. Be aware though, some of the returns in the near-term were weak, suggesting a pullback after such a strong move is likely. Still, this much strength in such a short timeframe could very well suggest the rest of 2020 could have bulls smiling.

# Dogs of the Dow Performance So Far in 2020

> The average stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 16.24% on a total return basis so far in 2020. Below we take a look at how the ""Dogs of the Dow"" strategy has performed so far this year.

> The ""Dogs of the Dow"" strategy is a very passive approach that simply says to buy the 10 stocks in the Dow 30 that have the highest dividend yields at the start of each year. The Dogs list for 2020 was led by Dow Inc. (DOW) with a yield of 5.12% on January 1st. Exxon Mobil (XOM), IBM, Verizon (VZ), Chevron (CVX), Pfizer (PFE), 3M (MMM), Walgreens (WBA), Cisco (CSCO), and Coca-Cola (KO) are the nine other members of the Dogs for 2020.

> As shown in the table below, the Dogs are down an average of 19.37% on a total return basis in 2020, which is a little less than five percentage points worse than the 14.68% decline seen for the 20 non-Dogs this year. Dow Inc. (DOW) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) have been the two worst performing Dogs with respective YTD declines of 39.9% and 37.0%. Dow's dividend yield has risen from 5.12% up to 8.47%, while XOM's yield has risen from 4.99% up to 7.91%. There are no Dogs that are up on the year, but Verizon (VZ) and Pfizer (PFE) have been the best performers of the group with YTD declines of less than 5%.

> Of the non-Dogs, Boeing (BA) has been by far the worst performer with a YTD decline of 60.01%. At the start of 2020, BA had a dividend yield of 2.52%, but that dividend has been suspended. JP Morgan (JPM), American Express (AXP) and Disney (DIS) have all fallen more than 30% YTD, while Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Walmart (WMT), and Microsoft (MSFT) are the only three Dow stocks that are up on the year.

# Investors Giving Companies a Pass on Earnings So Far

> We're now two weeks into the Q1 2020 earnings season, and just over 200 companies have reported their numbers so far. The average one-day price change for the stocks that have reported earnings so far this season has been a gain of 0.89%. That's much stronger than the average one-day gain of 0.06% seen for all stocks that have reported earnings since 2001.

> As shown below, stocks that have beaten EPS estimates this season have averaged a one-day price gain of 2.16% on their earnings reaction days. That's stronger than the average one-day gain of 1.89% seen on earnings reaction days for all stocks that have reported since 2001. Stocks that have missed EPS estimates this season have seen a one-day decline of 0.72% on their earnings reaction days. Historically, the average stock that has missed EPS has fallen 3.56% on its earnings reaction day, so this season's decline of just 0.72% suggests that investors are basically giving a pass to companies missing estimates in Q1.

# Next Week's Economic Indicators

> Even though most economic data releases this week that had forecasts exceeded those estimates (10 of 15), data continues to come in very weak. The Chicago Fed’s National Activity index started off the week coming in at –4.19 which was well below estimates of –3. Existing home sales followed up on Tuesday, and despite coming in above estimates, sales slowed considerably from February. Elsewhere in housing data, new home sales collapsed down to 627K SAAR compared to 765K last month. Meanwhile, February home prices showed some acceleration. Jobless claims also were better than expected, but they too remain at extremely elevated levels relative to the rest of history. Manufacturing data was a major area of weakness this week. Both the preliminary Markit PMI and Kansas City Fed reading fell significantly despite coming in better than forecast. Hard manufacturing data on Friday was likewise bad at the headline level though under the hood there were some silver linings.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/eco-1.png))**

> Turning to next week, like the earnings calendar, the economic calendar ramps up with a total of 34 releases. We will get the final two regional Federal Reserve indices from Dallas and Richmond on Monday and Tuesday, respectively, followed by the final Markit and ISM reading for April on Friday. Wednesday will be the most closely watched day of the week with the first release of Q1 GDP as well as an FOMC rate decision. Growth in the first quarter is expected to show a 3.8% contraction. Although no change in rates is being forecast, Fed Chair Powell’s following presser will likely be closely watched for a monetary policy update.

# Biggest Companies Reporting Earnings Next Week (AAPL, AMZN, MSFT and More)

> The earnings calendar has begun to ramp up over the past two weeks and over the next two weeks we will see peak earnings season. Next week there are a total of 784 companies scheduled to release earnings. Of those, there are 178 S&P 500 stocks, which is 35.% of the index.

> In the table below we show the 30 largest stocks (by market cap) that are scheduled to report next week. None of the largest stocks report on Monday, but the two Dow pharmaceutical stocks, Merck (MRK) and Pfizer (PFE), kick things off Tuesday morning. The trillion dollar market cap club will all report next week with Microsoft (MSFT) out with earnings Wednesday night and Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) out the following evening. Two other notable releases Wednesday and Thursday, respectively, will be the major payment processors Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA). Friday will be capped off with two oil giants: Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX). Other honorable mentions not on this list reporting next week include industrial bell-weather Caterpillar (CAT), stocks likely benefiting from the COVID economy like Colgate Palmolive (CL) and Clorox (CLX), and finally, some travel and leisure stocks like Expedia (EXPE), Royal Caribbean (RCL), United Airlines (UAL), and Southwest Airlines (LUV).

# Gold Bounces Right Where It Was Supposed To

> With central banks around the world unleashing waves of liquidity, there have been heightened concerns that one result will be a decline in the purchasing power of our money. For that reason, a number of investors have been flocking to gold. Even before the COVID-19 crisis, gold prices had been in a solid uptrend, and while prices spiked as the crisis first began, they couldn't quite get above the $1,650 - $1,700 range. In mid-March even, prices plummeted with just about every other financial asset before quickly recovering. Once again, though, the rally stalled at resistance. This time around, though, the 50-day moving average was strong enough to provide support and after that test, gold finally got the long-awaited breakout that investors had been waiting for.

> Gold's price spiked as high as $1,787 per ounce in mid-April before running out of momentum. When a stock or commodity breaks out above resistance to new highs and then pulls back, the former resistance level should act as support, and that is exactly what we saw this time around. This week, gold bounced right on cue at around $1,700 and has since rallied 2.6%. With the first test of support proving successful, look for gold to now establish a new range with a floor at around $1,700. At least that's what the technical analysis textbooks would say.

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/wallstreetbets."
Norges Bank (NORWAY) - Potentially Something HUGE Here,69,thk065,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/thk065/norges_bank_norway_potentially_something_huge_here/,48,2022-03-19 06:35:03,"Look, I'm not hyperbolic like many schmoes on here. Heck, I'm the boring $DGX DD guy. **But something MASSIVE potentially just happened today involving Norges Bank (central bank of Norway).** I am 99% sure they divested from multiple (possibly all?) US stock holdings at the closing bell today. No, I don't know what this means....but I do know there is breaking news TODAY regarding a US military plane going down in NORWAY during ""planned"" NATO exercises. Maybe just a coincidence, but this divestiture is big news regardless of the cause anyway. 

For context, Norges Bank holds (or held) very substantial positions in multiple US staples. One of which is **Verizon $VZ** at $2 BILLION, making them one of the largest shareholders period. Another company is **Colgate $CL** where they were in for $700m. **Basically Norges owned 1% of both of these companies, which is certainly a material amount.** 

**So how did I figure all this out?** Keeping it as brief as possible so I don't spend my entire Friday night on WSB. In the last 5 minutes of trading today, $VZ volume went through the roof out of nowhere and the stock dropped an additional 2%. All happened in literally a few minutes. This isn't normal obviously. No one seemed to know who, why, or what caused it so I start looking for other companies with similar movement today. **I quickly notice Colgate had the exact same thing happen at the exact same time as Verizon.** Now I'm interested. This is two companies in entirely different spaces and both are relatively safe defensive dividend stocks with ZERO news on the day. 

So I go look at institutional filings for both $VZ and $CL. What do ya know? Norges Bank's previously listed shares tie practically perfectly to the abrupt volume spike for both Verizon and Colgate. Norges Bank divested entirely from enormous positions in these companies. **They did it suddenly and in a kneejerk move because no institution or fund would unwind positions of that size all at once.** You are guaranteed to take the largest loss possible doing this / hurt your value.  

They may have divested from multiple other companies as well, but I haven't had a chance to dive deeper. The question is why? Did they get underwater in another position? Margin called? Geopolitics? That's for WSB to decide."
In-Depth Analysis and Valuation on Zoom Video Communications (ZM),106,g73gt5,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g73gt5/indepth_analysis_and_valuation_on_zoom_video/,69,2020-04-24 12:08:20,"**\*\*\*If you hate reading then skim through and only look at the bolded//All Analysis conducted on 4/20 closing prices\*\*\***

**Section I: Executive Summary Investment Thesis (Valuation as of 4/20)**

* Zoom provides a ‘video-first’ cloud-native scalable communications platform that changes how people interact through frictionless video, voice, chat, and content sharing
   * It primarily serves enterprises in the Americas, Asia Pacific, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, but also caters to individuals as well
* **Zoom’s (ZM) share price (****as of 4/20/2020****) is $148.99**
   * I believe that they are overvalued and should be priced around $70-$85
      * **While the market went down 30%, ZM shares have climbed 17% since the market peak on Feb. 19 (ZM was at $104) and peaked at $164.94 on March 23 (the day the market reached its current low)**
* I think the rise in Zoom shares is unwarranted, regardless of stay at home circumstances surrounding the Coronavirus.
   * **Management noted materially higher usage from free users but saw no significant revenue uplift from the pandemic**. Users have spiked from 10 million in December to 200 million in March, and just recently 300 million.
   * **The company’s funnel is increasing, as so many users are having a trial by fire on Zoom’s video calling application. However, I am skeptical that Zoom will be able to convert enough of these free users within a reasonable time frame to justify the current valuation.**
* **I want to clarify that I see Zoom growing tremendously over the next five years, but the price is way ahead of itself**
   * I attribute the growth to its Y/Y revenue growth being 88.4% over the past year, 118% the year prior, and 149% two years prior.
   * With a SaaS business model, Zoom will enjoy a low CapEx due to third-party hosting (mostly Amazon Web Services) which eliminates the costs of self-managed servers, and as such is positioned against significant depreciation costs
   * I point to the **PEG** (**appropriate for high growth/speculative stocks**) and P/E ratios to expected favorable future earnings, but also an indication that the stock is highly overvalued
      * **NTM** (next twelve months) **PEG is 10x** which means that the stock is **overvalued** when **taking into account both current earnings and the expected growth rate for these earnings in the future**
      * LTM P/E ratio of 1489.9x and a NTM P/E ratio of 346.5x which both indicate the stock is trading high relative to earnings but offers little insight into the company’s EPS growth prospects

**List of Key Drivers**

* **Zoom was actually profitable on a GAAP basis in fiscal 2019**
   * Unlike many young software companies, I expect profitability to continue as SaaS business models generally have consistent costs
* **Strong balance sheet with $0 debt and approximately $850 million in total cash and short term investments**
* **Long runway for growth with continued market penetration through leveraging their cloud-based solution's ease of use and innovative features**
   * Gaining traction with its Zoom Phones VoIP solutions with more than 2,900 customers
   * Pricing tiers are based on a per user per month basis and include Basic (free), Pro ($15), Business ($20), and Enterprise for $20 (more features with a volume discount).
   * Zoom Rooms enables conference rooms with Zoom Meetings functionality and is $49 per room per month.
   * Zoom Conference Room Connector allows organizations using legacy providers (such as Cisco) to join Zoom meetings and is priced at $49 per port per month.
* In its S-1 filing, the company sized the unified communications and collaboration market at $43.1 billion by 2022, with a 3% annual market growth rate and a clear shift toward cloud-based solutions
   * It is clear that cloud-based software is an emerging market within communications that has tremendous growth potential
* **The unprecedented circumstances surrounding academics and work has given Zoom the ability to place its service in the hands of millions of people and the opportunity to retain some of these customers**

**\*\*\*List of Key Risks \*\*\***

* **Strong competition from a variety of technology providers**
   * **Cisco (Webex) and Microsoft (Teams and Skype) dominate the video conferencing market and can bundle a broad array of solutions in response to a competitive threat from Zoom.**
   * **The industry has considerable intellectual property development which exposes Zoom** to **adverse rulings** in patent infringement cases that could force the company to pay **confiscatory license fees** or **abandon technology altogether**
* **Zoom offers a freemium model** and **caters to companies** of all sizes which means **revenue is concentrated among the largest customers.** 
   * **Smaller customers typically have higher churn,** which could be exacerbated in Zoom’s case, where the **number of free users far outpaces the number of paid users**. I believe the nature of the model would dictate a higher churn than fully paid enterprise software models.
   * It remains unclear whether we are witnessing a paradigm shift in the way people work that enables Zoom to convert a substantial proportion of the new free users into paying subscribers or whether these users will simply abandon the service when the current restrictions are lifted
* Although expected to produce revenue growth at the high end of peers, this higher valuation offers less room for missteps and therefore carries greater inherent risks 
   * **Zoom faces several lawsuits surrounding privacy concerns**
   * **Risks of customer data breaches** and service outages especially with **80% of Zoom’s R&D staff is based in China** which poses a significant risk due to trade relations, data sensitivity, and the significant rise of intellectual property and trade secret theft present in China
   * Zoom completed its IPO in April 2019, so it has a **limited operating history as a public company to scrutinize**
   * **At high valuation levels, companies can often become momentum stocks that are punished severely if they do not deliver against expectations, which are regularly higher than consensus**
* Executing across so many different aspects of growth simultaneously in their product portfolio.
   * Zoom Phone (VoIP product) is a more complex sale, the company is moving from smaller to larger customers, and there is a new head of sales.

**Section II: Intrinsic Value** 

* Three Stage Growth
   * Zoom is currently in its early-high growth stage and will continue to benefit from high revenue growth for several years to come
      * I expect this growth to significantly fade in FYE 2026 to relatively lower and stable rates
   * **There is a strong indication that revenue will grow as a result of customers increasing 20-fold from 10 million in December 2019 to 300 million in March 2020**
      * **I expect that most of the revenue will result in businesses allowing more employees to work from home due** to the obvious viability of the platform for online meetings and work, which presents the opportunity to downsize offices to cut costs
      * **I still expect the number of customers to go down tremendously from its current high once schools and businesses return to normal operations**
   * Free Cash Flow to Equity approach

* **8x8 Inc. (EGHT)** is a provider of Voice over IP products. Enterprise Value = $1,981 million
   * 8x8 products include cloud-based voice, contact center, video, mobile and unified communications for businesses. Zoom directly competes in the VoIP market segment with 8x8
   * Company has a struggling financial situation but provides insights into how this specific segment of the communications industry (that is VoIP) is oversaturated with competition and offers little to no opportunity for growth
      * This may be the reason Zoom only offers its VoIP product in a package with other products
* **Adobe Inc. (ADBE)** is a software company. Enterprise Value = $159,048 million
   * The Company offers products and services used by professionals, marketers, knowledge workers, application developers, enterprises, and consumers for creating, managing, measuring, optimizing, and engaging with compelling content and experiences.
   * Adobe is a mature state software company that offers insights into what a successful SaaS business with a diversified portfolio of quality products looks like, which is helpful to compare to a young company like Zoom.

**Multiples**

[Zoom is astronomically higher than its peers in every multiple except for NTM EPS](https://preview.redd.it/dn603roolpu41.png?width=483&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f7b0bf5f7992985f009f598d91a12e830d665a0)

**TLDR: Although Zoom should be trading at multiples  higher than its peers as it is a relatively new company and only IPO'd in 2019, the current share price (as of 4/20/2020) is way ahead of itself. With speculative high-growth stocks one should pay closer attention to the PEG Ratio rather than the P/E ratio (PEG of 1 indicates it is neither overvalued or undervalued; <1 is undervalued; >1 is overvalued)** In conclusion, I feel that ZM is highly overvalued when compared to its peers, the DCF yields a stock range that shows Zoom is overvalued as well, but that it justifies higher multiples and ratios. I want to emphasize that given the current market situation, a likely bear market cycle for the greater part of the year, Zoom is trading significantly higher than it should be. On top of this, its PEG ratio (over 1 is considered overvalued) shows that the stock is significantly higher than its projected EPS growth as well as that it has a high P/E ratio to begin with. 

**TLDR; TLDR:** Appropriate range according to peers: $70-$85 --> More appropriate range would be $85-$100 taking into account my FCFE model (which is very difficult to conduct with only four years of financial information)

**Strike and Date:** 8/21 $85p - $100p range ... to be even safer: 11/20 $100p

#Trading Update

    •  Market update – there isn’t too much to mention on the macro front, esp. from the
perspective of US equities. The main headlines out of Washington concerned potential
White House staff shakeups w/Michael Flynn appearing esp. at risk. Economic and
company-specific headlines were relatively sparse. North Korea fired a missile Sat night but
it wasn’t of intercontinental-range (and thus isn’t disrupting financial markets) while the
Abe/Thy God-Emperor Trump summit was most notable for what didn’t happen (there was no material
rhetoric around trade, FX, or defense spending).
    •  Calendar for Mon Feb 13 – the only major events on 2/13 are earnings-related (FDC and
TEVA pre-open and ACGL, CSOD, DDR, OMF, RNG, and VNO after the close). Also Thy God-Emperor Trump
will be hosting Canadian PM Trudeau at the White House and Mnuchin could be confirmed
as Treasury Sec. as soon as Mon night.
    •  FX – the DXY is flattish overall. The JPY is down ~45-50bp after the Abe/Thy God-Emperor Trump summit
ended w/o any contentious rhetoric around trade or FX.
 

    •  Eurozone equities – the major indices are trading up ~35-50bp. Gains are broad but autos,
basic resources, chemicals, and media are outperforming while banks, telecoms, and retail
underperform. Stada is rallying after receiving two takeout bids.
    •  Asia – stocks gained across the board in Asia: Japan (TPX +0.49%, NKY +0.41%), HK (Hang
Seng +0.58%, HSCEI +1.31%), mainland China (SHCOMP +0.63%, Shenzhen +0.74%, CSI 300
+0.67%), Taiwan (TAIEX +0.46%), Korea (KOSPI +0.17%), Australia (ASX 200 +0.7%), and India
(up 5-10bp for the major indices). There weren’t too many major headlines. Japan’s GDP
was a touch below the St. China’s PBOC resumed issuing reverse repos following a 6-day
halt. Media reports in China suggest the CNY could stabilize around current levels.
    •  HK/China – the major indices traded well in HK and on the mainland. Major news was
relatively quiet. Within the Hang Seng, telecoms and fins outperformed while real estate,
consumer discretionary, and utilities lagged. China Life, AAC Tech, China Resources Power,
ICBC, Bank of China, Belle Int’l, and HKEX all outperformed while Li & Fung, Sands China,
Link REIT, Sino Land, and China Mengniu Dairy underperformed.
    •  Japan - Risk-on sentiment continued with a Cyclical-led rally taking hold on firm commodity
prices and USDJPY's tread higher towards the 114 handle as Abe/Thy God-Emperor Trump meetings ended
without any conflict on trade or currency issues. Commodity related names led the charge:
Oil plays Mining +4.5% and Oil +2.6% rallied on Fri's IEA production data of 90% compliance
to agreed cuts, along with Inpex's strong earnings results. Copper-sensitives (SMM +2.7%,
Dowa +4.2%, Mit Materials +5.7%) were strong after Copper's +5% move on BHP
Escondida's strike and as the stand-off between FCX and Indonesia continued. There was
also an interesting rotation within the rest of the Cyclical/Beta space with lagging Autos
+0.7%, Shippers +1.5%, Elec Appliance +0.9% extending gains, while some recent
outperformers (Machinery, Chems...) appeared to be getting unwound - of note, popular
'Thy God-Emperor Trump' proxy trades like Softbank -1.5%, Fanuc -0.2%, Keyence -0.7% were unable to break
higher. In earnings: 85% of cos in TPX have reported with a 70% positive surprise ratio.
Today - Daifuku +8.4%, Nabtesco +6.3% jumped after solid earnings while Iida -8.5%, Lion -
7.6% traded lower on their inline results. Toshiba +5% edged higher ahead of its earnings
tomorrow.
    •  US macro update: the backdrop for the SPX remains largely unchanged. Current earnings
and growth trends alone could result in SPX EPS of ~$127 in ’17 and ~$135-137 in ’18 w/o
anything happening in Washington (recall the nominal growth improvement commenced
prior to the election on 11/8). On these numbers the PE for ’17 is rich at ~18.25x but falls to
~17x using the ~$136 assumption for ’18. Full implementation of the Thy God-Emperor Trump/Ryan fiscal
agenda could add as much as $8-12 to SPX EPS and using ~$145 in ’18 would bring the
current PE to a reasonable ~16x. However, it is by no means a given that Thy God-Emperor Trump/Ryan can
move their blueprint through the Senate and in fact risks are rising for an extended period
of gridlock as Republicans grapple with their ACA repeal/replace pledge while tax/spending
plans run into enormous fiscal (limited balance sheet capacity), logistical (Senate math), and
ideological (deficit hawk resistance) obstacles.

#Top Headlines for Monday

    •  Thy God-Emperor Trump White House shakeup possible w/Flynn’s role as Nat. Sec. Advisor looking
increasingly tenuous – the White House is reviewing whether to retain Flynn as National
Security Advisor amid a metastasizing scandal involving contacts w/Russian officials over US
sanctions prior to Thy God-Emperor Trump’s inauguration. Some within the White House are hoping Flynn
resigns on his own (http://on.wsj.com/2kBu3gr). The NYT talks about “turmoil” within the
National Security Council, not only b/c of Flynn’s Russia controversy but also due to his poor
management skills and a lack of coordination w/the White House and other agencies (like
State, Defense, the CIA, etc.). The Times talks about NSC employees waking up in the
morning and struggling to construct a foreign policy based on Thy God-Emperor Trump’s overnight twitter
postings (http://nyti.ms/2l66Gz6).
o Thy God-Emperor Trump considering staff shakeup – while Michael Flynn is most at risk, Thy God-Emperor Trump is
apparently considering other changes as well. Thy God-Emperor Trump has told several people he is
particularly displeased w/Flynn. Spicer and Priebus also could be on thin ice.
Politico. http://politi.co/2lHkOfY
o Reince Priebus comes under scrutiny from Thy God-Emperor Trump friend – a longtime friend of
Thy God-Emperor Trump who met w/him over the weekend in Florida issued a public criticism of
Reince Priebus and suggested the White House may not stabilize until a new chief of
staff has been installed. Christopher Ruddy, the chief executive of Newsmax Media,
said Priebus was in over his head (http://nyti.ms/2kJP0s9). According to a Politico
article, Kellyanne Conway is angling to become the next chief of staff
(http://politi.co/2kzElxP).
    •  Company-specific news update for Mon morning – according to Reuters, China’s Sinochem
is in early talks to buy a stake in commodities trader Noble Group (http://reut.rs/2l6s2wu).
The FT had an article discussing China’s Dalian Wanda Group holding talks to buy Deutsche
Bank’s Postbank unit although Dalian has since come out and denied this report
(http://reut.rs/2lHmJB1). Stada is spiking in European trading after the co said it has
received two takeover bids and Co-Operative Bank has put itself up for sale. ON reported
earnings Sun afternoon and results/guidance were nicely ahead of the St and Digitimes says
MU is considering a sale of its NOR assets (http://bit.ly/2lAEEg0). The NY Post says AMZN is
considering an HBO-like premium video channel to house its growing library of proprietary
content (http://nyp.st/2l6nczo). VZ will introduce an unlimited data plan Mon, its first in
more than five years; the move is a change in direction for VZ and reflects escalating
competition in the industry (Reuters http://reut.rs/2l9pjlF).
    •  Eco data recap for Mon morning – the only major numbers came out of Japan w/Q4 GDP
coming in +1% (about inline w/the St +1.1%). The GDP result was a disappointment vs. the
JPMorgan forecast of +2% (http://bit.ly/2kYHA2J). The European Commission raised its
growth forecasts for ’17 and ’18 for the EU (from +1.5% to +1.6% for ’17 and from +1.7% to
+1.8% for ’18).
    •  China is considering a “radical” plan to cut smog in the country – the gov’t could force
more steel and aluminum output cuts, ban coal from one of the top ports, and shutter
certain fertilizer and drug plants – Reuters http://reut.rs/2kBDbBH
    •  China – the yuan will likely stabilize around current levels according to an article in Xinhua
as Chinese growth improves and its relationship w/the Thy God-Emperor Trump administration advances -
http://bit.ly/2kIt5S0
    •  China – the PBOC has resumed issuing reverse repos following a 6-day halt – Bloomberg
http://bloom.bg/2kBKjOw
Top Headlines from the Weekend
    •  Thy God-Emperor Trump’s foreign policy is proving to be a lot less radical than feared – both the NYT
(http://nyti.ms/2l0fc2H) and WSJ (http://on.wsj.com/2l3kuKW) note how Thy God-Emperor Trump is quietly
adopting some of the major decades-old tenets of US foreign policy in a reversal from his
campaign rhetoric. Thy God-Emperor Trump has backed away from unorthodox views on matters including
China/Taiwan, Israel/settlements, Iran, NATO, and other large foreign policy issues. Despite
fears of a disruptive foreign policy Thy God-Emperor Trump is proving to be quite quotidian.
    •  North Korea – North Korea fired a ballistic missile towards the sea off its eastern coast Sat
night (ET) although it wasn’t of intercontinental-range (which would have been a much
more provocative step). The US military said the missile didn’t pose a threat to North
America. Thy God-Emperor Trump and Japanese PM Abe held a hastily arranged joint appearance in response;
Abe called the launch “absolutely intolerable” while Thy God-Emperor Trump didn’t address the topic directly
(although he pledged US support for Japan). NYT. http://nyti.ms/2kGRKXn
    •  NATO expansion – Thy God-Emperor Trump is leaning towards supporting Montenegro’s bid to join NATO
despite objections from Russia – WSJ http://on.wsj.com/2lBK4E4
    •  Gary Cohn the subject of two favorable profiles this weekend, including the NYT (“Thy God-Emperor Trump’s
economic cabinet is mostly bare. This man fills the void” http://nyti.ms/2l7Fxvj) and WSJ
(“Gary Cohn has emerged as an economic-policy powerhouse in Thy God-Emperor Trump administration”
http://on.wsj.com/2lCID7C). Cohn is the driver behind pretty much every aspect of White
House economic and tax policy – he is called into the Oval Office up to five times per day for
impromptu meetings w/Thy God-Emperor Trump and the two converse on other occasions too. Cohn is
tasked w/tax reform (corporate and individual), infrastructure spending (Cohn is in favor of
public/private partnerships), and deregulation. Cohn also has been given ACA
repeal/replace.
o Goldman’s Jim Donovan is under consideration for the #2 job at Treasury although
some in the White House are growing concerned about having “too many
Goldman people” – Bloomberg http://bloom.bg/2kGNNC8
o Thy God-Emperor Trump plans to nominate David Malpass as US Treasury undersecretary for int’l
affairs – Bloomberg http://bloom.bg/2lyoi7B
o The most dangerous man in Thy God-Emperor Trump’s universe is a person who usually doesn’t
receive much attention: Peter Navarro. Politico discusses how Navarro “could lead
us into a global depression – or worse”. Politico. http://politi.co/2kHPxec
    •  Republicans worry about elevated expectations – some within the party are nervous that
expectations have become too elevated and that the agenda is now too crowded with
politically difficult objectives. “There’s no way we can do all these issues. Think about it. We
have two appropriations to do before Sept. 30, plus tax reform, the wall, infrastructure. Any
two would be Herculean. My idea that I’ve shared with a few people is we’ve got to
prioritize these things. If you only get seven big things half-way down the road, that’s
nothing … so you’ve got to prioritize”. Healthcare is still a huge obstacle as ACA
repeal/replace needs to happen before anything on the fiscal agenda gets addressed (but
the party has yet to coalesce around a healthcare strategy). The Hill http://bit.ly/2kXfgAj
    •  A Tax Overhaul Would Be Great in Theory. Here’s Why It’s So Hard in Practice – the NYT
article doesn’t contain any incremental information but it explains why tax reform will be
much more complicated to effectuate than markets seem to realize.
http://nyti.ms/2kuJw1P
    •  Why Thy God-Emperor Trump's tax reform could still be a long time coming – the article doesn’t contain any
incremental information but it notes that tax reform will take a lot longer than the market
appreciates. CNBC. http://cnb.cx/2kQR8Ne
    •  “Thy God-Emperor Trump Trade” stalls – inflation expectations surged in the aftermath of 11/8 although have
stalled out lately as investors question when fiscal policy changes will actually happen and
the ultimate impact of tax reform and infrastructure spending. Meanwhile investors are
quietly dialing back expectations around the pace of Fed tightening. WSJ
http://on.wsj.com/2kWHNUk
    •  Fed’s Fischer spoke Sat morning in the UK and said there was sig. uncertainty about the
outlook for US fiscal policy under Thy God-Emperor Trump but promised to be strict in hitting the dual
mandates of full employment and 2% inflation. Fischer also said bank capital requirements
shouldn’t be significantly reduced (he doesn’t think Dodd-Frank will be repealed wholly
although adjustments to it are possible). Reuters http://reut.rs/2kDLUGh
    •  Fed – Daniel Tarulo, who had been unofficially the Fed’s point man on bank regulation,
announced Fri afternoon (at 1:30pmET) that he would resign around Apr 5. The move was
largely expected but Tarullo’s departure will leave three vacant seats on the Fed board and
thus represents an opportunity for Thy God-Emperor Trump to immediately leave his imprint on monetary
 
5
policy. According to media reports, David Nason, an executive at GE, has emerged as the
leading candidate for the vice chair in charge of bank oversight. WSJ.
http://on.wsj.com/2kAXAcS
    •  ECB forward guidance change? A Bloomberg article discusses a push by some at the ECB to
moderate the forward guidance language and remove pledges of cutting rates to even lower
levels. Given the improved Eurozone growth/inflation figures there is a concern that the
current forward guidance could result in a loss of credibility for the ECB – Bloomberg
http://bloom.bg/2kl1DXo
Calendar of events to watch for the Week of Mon 2/13
    •  The big focus this week will be on central banks w/two days of Yellen testimony (Senate
Tues 2/14 and House Wed 2/15) and ECB meeting minutes (Thurs 2/16). While markets are
waiting for some answers on Fed-related matters, the near-term policy outlook isn’t very
controversial and thus the Yellen testimony may not be enormously impactful (despite some
talk about a Mar hike this looks unlikely at the moment given the present state of economic
data). That being said Yellen will probably touch on a host of subjects during the testimony,
including the outlook for growth/inflation, the path for near-term tightening (the “dots” are
guiding for three hikes in 2017), balance sheet policies, the regulatory outlook (what does
Yellen think about Thy God-Emperor Trump’s Dodd-Frank order?), etc. As for the ECB, officials have been
vocal lately in pushing back against taper talk but it will be interesting to see if that
sentiment comes through in the minutes. In addition to central banks, investors will also be
looking at the US inflation numbers (PPI Tues 2/14 and CPI Wed 2/15), US retail sales (Wed
2/15), Netanyahu’s visit to the White House (Wed 2/15), and some Jan-end earnings
reports (A Tues night 2/14; ADI Wed morning 2/15; AMAT, CSCO, NTAP, and SNPS after the
close Wed 2/15; CPB and DE Fri morning 2/17).
    •  Calendar for Tues Feb 14 – the big events include China CPI/PPI for Jan (Mon night/Tues
morning), Eurozone IP/GDP data (5amET), the US PPI (8:30amET), Yellen’s testimony
before the Senate, and earnings (CS, DISCA, DPS, MLM, TAP, TMUS, and WSO pre-open and
A, CALX, ESRX, FOSL, HUBS, and VDSI after the close).
    •  Calendar for Wed Feb 15 – the focus will be on the US eco data (Feb Empire, Jan CPI, Jan
retail sales all at 8:30amET, Jan IP at 9:15amET, and the Feb NAHB housing market index at
10amET), Yellen’s testimony before the House, Netanyahu’s visit to the White House, and
earnings (ADI, Danone, Heineken, HLT, HUN, OZM, PEP, SODA, USFD, and WYN pre-open
and AMAT, CAR, BS, CF, CSCO, EQIX, GDDY, HAWK, KHC, MAR, MOH, NTAP, QTWO, SNPS,
SSNC, TIVO, TRIP, and WMB after the close).
    •  Calendar for Thurs Feb 16 – the focus will be on the ECB meeting minutes (7:30amET), US
eco data (Jan housing starts/building permits and Feb Philadelphia Fed at 8:30amET), and
earnings (ALXN, AVP, CAB, CHTR, DF, GNC, H, LH, MGM, TIME, WM, and ZTS pre-open and
ANET, DLR, MDRX, RSG, VECO, and WMBD after the close).
    •  Calendar for Fri Feb 17 – the only events on this day are earnings-related (Allianz, BLMN,
CPB, CTB, DE, FLR, LPNT, MCO, SJM, VFC, and WBC pre-open).

#Catalysts for 2017 – big events to watch for 2017 (preliminary list – additional events likely to be
added)

    •  Yellen testimony – Yellen will provide semiannual monetary testimony Tues 2/14 and Wed
2/15.
    •  Israel/US – Netanyahu to visit the US on Wed Feb 15.
    •  ECB minutes – minutes from the last ECB meeting will hit Thurs 2/16.
    •  Eurogroup meeting/Greece – many think the Feb 20 Eurogroup meeting may be one of the
last opportunities to resolve Greece (as afterwards governments will turn their focus to
elections in the Netherlands, France, Germany, and possibly Italy).
    •  Retailers quantify impact of border adjustment – the Jan-end retail earnings season kicks
off Tues morning 2/21 w/results due from HD, M, and WMT (note that Mon 2/20 is a
holiday in the US). It will be interesting to hear the extent to which mgmt. teams outline the
impact of the GOP border tax proposal.
    •  Fed minutes - FOMC minutes from 2/1 meeting Wed 2/22. 2pmET.
    •  Thy God-Emperor Trump to address joint session of Congress – Feb 28.

    •  Fed meeting – first press conf./dot plot decision of the year is Mar 15.
    •  G20 Fin Min/central bank governors meeting Mar 17-18 in Germany.
    •  China’s National People’s Congress (NPC) and Chinese People’s Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC) usually take place in mid-Mar; the gov’t will formally publish its 2017
economic objectives at this event.
    •  US debt ceiling - the debt limit has been suspended since late ’15 but is due to be reinstated
on Mar 16, 2017 (although the Treasury will likely be able to extend this date by a couple of
months at least).
    •  EU Leaders Summit Mar 25 – this could be the forum at which the UK formally triggers
Article 50 (although recent media reports suggest the triggering could come in mid-Mar).
    •  WFC’s “living will” – WFC will resubmit its living will in the Mar timeframe. Normally this
wouldn’t be a major event but if WFC’s living will is deemed inadequate again the Fed could
raise the company’s capital requirements.
    •  Bank stress tests – US bank stress tests to be submitted to regulators by Apr 5
    •  France first-round presidential election Apr 23 (run-off is May 7).
    •  US Treasury publishes semi-annual currency report around Apr timeframe (investors will
watch China’s designation closely and if it gets labeled a currency manipulator).
    •  US gov’t funding – current spending legislation will keep the gov’t funding until Apr 28
    •  OPEC – the next formal OPEC summit is May 25
    •  NATO summit – NATO will hold a summit in May; Montenegro is expected to become a
NATO member at this event; Thy God-Emperor Trump will likely attend.
    •  G7 Leaders Summit May 26-27 in Italy.
    •  US financial regulatory review – the Treasury will present recommendations to Thy God-Emperor Trump
around the end of May/start of June on ways to ease financial regulations.
    •  Italy – new elections could take place in the June timeframe.
    •  OPEC – the current OPEC supply agreement is due to expire at the end of June.
    •  Russia – European sanctions against Russia are due to expire in June. Given the likely
outcome of the French election, they will prob. not be extended
(http://on.wsj.com/2iHEYUB).
    •  China/MSCI - MSCI will announce the result of the China A shares inclusion proposal as part
of the 2017 Market Classification Review in June 2017.
    •  US bank stress tests – the Fed will publish bank stress test results in June.

What’s your play for next month,44,ldsvhy,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldsvhy/whats_your_play_for_next_month/,62,2021-02-06 13:34:10,"Enough of these diamond hand post, tired of whining little bitches crying about not getting rich over night. Welcome to WSB. We risk it for the biscuit. Raw dog strippers and snort blow we got off some random dude named Doug in the restroom. 

What’s y’all’s play for next month ? I know we all got money to burn, I’m thinking about some good APHA calls $20. Haven’t gotten them yet but we’ll see if the price is right Monday opening. Got 2k to throw around, nah nevermind make it 1.5k (gotta get beer and blow), need some option opinions that’ll atleast bring 30-50% return in a month. 

Also looking into some VZ $52.50 calls expiring in April 16. Heard it from some random guy in this subreddit so it must be true 💀"
Assume for a moment the stock market was not in a bubble before,29,fpl5vz,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fpl5vz/assume_for_a_moment_the_stock_market_was_not_in_a/,74,2020-03-27 03:59:19,"Assume for a moment that recent technological advancements in cloud, AI, automation, etc has created a lot of excitement about the future and it wasn't just a bubble and rather good ol' exuberance, maybe a little excessive but not dangerously so.   Also, don't forget the Donald's  deregulation.   Yeah it's dangerous and stupid for the planet, but \*\*\*\* me, it really lets the capitalism roar loudly.    Tragedy of the commons can take awhile to bite you in the ass, especially at a global scale.

Ok, so the virus comes along and says ""look, any business that relies on human contact is totally \*\*\*\*ed.""   So bang, market comes crashing down, because there are a lot of tickers in the S&P that do rely on human contact.  You know, gaming / retail / restaurants -  MGM, WYNN, DRI, ULTA, HD, and yeah maybe even the health ones, but they have always been in a precarious spot - LNC, UHS, UNM.   DIS too got hit, but something tells me they will weather this.   They're more than just a bunch of resorts.

But those aside, really, if we assume the market was not really in a bubble before but merely a reflection of a society becoming wealthier due to tech and money was more free to do its thing.  Also, we see approval numbers come out that show Donald is actually pretty popular with his handling of the virus.

Why shouldn't the market take off like a rocket?  Yeah, those tickers above I think are still \*\*\*\*ed, but everything else should do OK.   Besides, they were stupid businesses anyway and did very little for over all social productivity.  They were just mostly expensive, time consuming entertainment and social waste- what does that really do anyways?

We may have to restructure our economy so that we're all more efficient in how we become entertained, but this actually may be a good thing, and reason to be optimistic about the future.

I'm talking MSFT, AMZN, GOOG(L), AAPL, NFLX, INTC, T, VZ, NVDA, NFLX, ADBE,  etc.  XLK is a reasonable tracker here.

I'm not saying buy calls, I'm just saying that the reports of death may have been exaggerated and Social distancing is not necessarily a bad thing.   Lots of very very productive people work and learn from home.

And then, of course let's not forget - the money machines go BRRRR \* 10\^infinity.

edit to add for the downvoters:  You're all thinking like a bunch of boomers.  How sad, expected more from WSB.   But it's OK, don't really want too many people reading this after all.  Smart investors make it hard to win the market"

Welcome to Wednesday! Here are your pre-market stock movers & news on this Wednesday morning-

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Wednesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/10/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-february-10-2021.html)

*****

> # 1. Dow set to bounce after breaking a six-session win streak

> * U.S. stock futures rose Wednesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average indicated up nearly 100 points. A late fade Tuesday resulted in the Dow and S&P 500 falling slightly from closing record highs and breaking six-session winning streaks. However, the Nasdaq managed to hold on to a modest advance and notching another record close.

> * On the economy, the government releases its look at January consumer prices at 8:30 a.m. ET, one hour before the opening bell on Wall Street. At 2 p.m. ET, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell speaks at an Economic Club of New York webinar, in an address focusing on the state of the American job market.

*****

> # 2. Coca-Cola, GM report better-than-expected Q4

> * Coca-Cola on Wednesday said the coronavirus pandemic is still hurting sales, but cost-cutting efforts helped it top analyst earnings estimates. Shares of the Dow component rose 2% in premarket trading. The beverage giant made 47 cents per share in the fourth-quarter. Net sales dropped 5% to $8.6 billion, missing expectations. Unit case volume, which strips out the impact of foreign currency, shrank by 3%. All four of its beverage segments reported volume declines.

> * Shares of General Motors fell more than 1% in the premarket after the U.S. automaker said Wednesday that a global semiconductor chip shortage could cut earnings by $1.5 billion and $2 billion this year. GM’s crosstown rival, Ford, last week said the chip shortage could lower its earnings. GM also issued fourth-quarter profit of $1.93 per share on revenue of $37.5 billion. Both beat analyst expectations.

*****

> # 3. Twitter is ‘bigger than any one account,’ CEO says

> * Shares of Twitter rose more than 5.5% in Wednesday’s premarket, the morning after the social media network reported fourth-quarter earnings of 38 cents per share on revenue of $1.29 billion, both of which beat estimates. Monetizable daily active users gained 30% to 192 million from a year ago, but still fell short of expectations. Twitter is “bigger than any one account,” said CEO Jack Dorsey, in his first earnings call following the ban of then-President Donald Trump last month, days after the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.

*****

> # 4. Trump impeachment trial continues with opening arguments

> * Opening arguments are set begin at noon ET Wednesday in Trump’s second impeachment trial. An emotional first day ended with the Senate voting to hear the case on whether to convict the former president of inciting the Capitol riot even though he’s no longer in office. Watching the proceedings from his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, Trump was furious at what he saw from his attorneys Tuesday, according to a person familiar with his thinking. The 50-50 split Senate is expected to acquit Trump.

*****

> # 5. Covid spike in the U.S. show signs of slowing

> * The crushing coronavirus spike in the U.S. has been showing signs of abating, with 95,360 new cases Tuesday less than a third of the record high new daily infections of 300,282 on Jan. 2. The number of people in U.S. hospitals being treated for Covid-19 totaled 79,179 on Tuesday, the first daily count below 80,000 since Nov. 18. U.S. deaths from the virus averaged 2,857 over the past seven days. Fatalities reached a single-day peak of 4,432 on Jan. 12.

> **General Motors (GM)** – The automaker beat estimates by 29 cents a share, with quarterly profit of $1.93 per share. Revenue came in above estimates as well. GM characterized the quarter as a strong one despite production interruptions caused by the pandemic. The company also issued a lower-than-expected full-year outlook, however, due to the ongoing worldwide shortage of semiconductors. The shares were volatile in premarket trading.

Southeastern Asset Management, the investment firm founded by Mason Hawkins (Trades, Portfolio) in 1975, disclosed it increased its stake in Lumen Technologies Inc. (NYSE:LUMN) by 3.66% last week.  The firm invested in 2.3 million shares of the Monroe, Louisiana-based telecommunications company on Dec. 3, impacting the equity portfolio by 0.62%. The stock traded for an average price of $10.51 per share on the day of the transaction.

***What’s interesting is the stock took a major hit on Monday evening after hours when it was announced:

FCC Subsidy Results Dim Lumen's Financial Outlook -- Market Talk
Mentioned:	CHTR LUMN
15:29 ET - Shares of Lumen sink more than 5% Monday after Federal Communications Commission data show the telecom company formerly called CenturyLink won about $26M a year under the latest round of federal subsidies for rural broadband service. The new Rural Digital Opportunity Fund payouts come well below the hundreds of millions in annual cash CenturyLink enjoyed under past programs, endangering a stable revenue source. Filling the void with more winning bids: new players like cable operator Charter Communications and SpaceX. (andrew.fitzgerald@wsj.com; @drewfitzgerald) 

Many saw this as a huge blow to revenues, but this was business that sharps believe LUMN did not want to win due to the low margins. 

Plus they have more lucrative contracts already locked up and we all know Elon has no problem running in the red to build a business. 

Actually there were more bidders for ever for this business and the FCC had set aside $16B for this auction and only had to use $9.6B - it was a race to the bottom. 

The average 10-day volume before the dip after hours was 10MM shares a day. 

The next day over 16MM volume and the stock rebounded - it was a buying opportunity for the heavy hitters to add on the dip and they did. 

Today the overall market pulled back and LUMN was up again on higher than normal volume - 13MM. 

It is being acquired by institutions, also the dividend is very attractive for these types of investors that hold 5-7 years. 

The play on LUMN is 5G fiber and here is how:

CenturyLink can thrive in a 5G world
Despite this massive, long-term decline, it could see an upswing as analysts forecast an increase in profits. Why? Put simply, instead of destroying CenturyLink, 5G may have saved the company.

As it so happens, 5G networks remain heavily dependent on fiber. From an infrastructure perspective, the biggest difference between the previous 4G LTE standard and the current 5G is the number of cells needed. Instead of one cell every few miles, 5G requires numerous small cells located close to one another. 

As a result, carriers have exponentially more cells, and they all need to connect to their networks. To do this, carriers such as AT&T (NYSE:T), T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS), and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) will need CenturyLink's fiber. Hence, instead of fiber becoming obsolete, it may become more important than ever to the telecom industry.

Which brings me to:

An old company with a new name
Will Healy (Lumen Technologies): The fiber company long known as CenturyLink has become an afterthought as consumers increasingly embrace wireless. Moreover, some investors might assume that a wireless telco industry makes fiber networks obsolete.

They should think again.

The exponentially higher number of 5G antennas will depend in large measure on fiber networks for backhaul. Furthermore, the Internet of Things (IoT) will also rely heavily on fiber to enable edge computing.


Additionally, Lumen is also well positioned for a popular Democratic program -- rural broadband. Based in Monroe, Louisiana, Lumen has used its network to offer high-speed internet to some rural areas. This could help Joe Biden, who has pledged broadband for ""every American"" in an effort to reach rural voters. Biden also worked to expand broadband access when he was vice president.

Lumen stock has experienced a secular decline since 2007 as consumers dropped landlines and cable TV. Moreover, its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of less than eight does not seem so cheap given tepid earnings growth. Furthermore, missed deadlines on SEC filings and a falling dividend have also hurt the stock.

However, even the reduced annual dividend of $1.00 per share still yields just over 9%. Also, with a free cash flow of $803 million exceeding the $291 million cost of its dividend in its most recent quarter, the payout should remain safe.

Regardless of who wins the election, Lumen stock could benefit as the company repurposes its network to support 5G and IoT. Nonetheless, if a Biden administration subsidizes rural broadband, Lumen could receive an additional boost.

In summary, this is not Century Link anymore, it’s something much different and ready to be a 5G PLAYER.  

I would have YOLO’d this one as well as I have 140 January 2022 $15c at an average of .50. 

I believe this has the legs and from what I laid out here think $30-40 could be realistic by Q4 2021. 

Lots of value and the big boys know it and are acquiring it."

#Trading Update

  * Market update – stocks rebounded throughout Asia (w/the exception of mainland China)
and the major Eurozone indices have a mild bid. US futures are up small. Nothing major
occurred overnight on the eco data/monetary fronts although there were a slew of articles
focusing on taxes and infrastructure spending. Axios says Thy God-Emperor Trump wants to couple the two
together in order to secure some support from Democrats (http://bit.ly/2obRa3v) while
Thy God-Emperor Trump may struggle to get the corporate rate much below 28% according to the NYT
(http://nyti.ms/2npLQJV). Overall the broader macro narrative stayed largely unchanged
over the last 12-18 hours (see below). The big focus on Tues will likely be on Fed speakers
(both Yellen and Fischer will be delivering comments) although Brady’s tax meeting will be
important too.

  * Calendar for Tues 3/28 – the focus will be on the US advanced goods trade balance for Feb
(8:30amET), US wholesale inventories for Feb (8:30amET), US Case-Shiller home prices for
Jan (9amET), US consumer confidence for Mar (10amET), some Fed speakers (including
Yellen at 12:50pmET and Fischer on CNBC at ~1:30pmET), Brady’s House Ways sand Means
Committee meeting (at which taxes will be discussed), Thy God-Emperor Trump’s climate change executive
order, analyst meetings (CY), and earnings (CCL, DRI, INFO, and MKC pre-open and SONC,
VRNT after the close).

  * FX/TSYs – the DXY is stabilizing after slumping ~45bp on Mon (the DXY is up ~10bp so far
Tues morning). The USD is flat vs. the EUR and JPY and is down small against the GBP.
Treasuries are pretty flat.

  * Europe – the major Eurozone indices are up ~25bp. Autos, basic resources, tech, banks,
media, and utilities are outperforming while staples, fin services, real estate, and telecoms
are lagging. Wolseley is one of the top stocks in the SXXP after posting solid earnings.
Credit Suisse said it would make a decision on capital “as soon as possible”. Ericsson was hit
at the open after issuing a restructuring update but the stock has since bounced. Redrow
said it will not make a bid for Bovis. Two of Tesco’s largest shareholders are calling on the
co to drop its bid for Booker. Akzo Nobel said it would provide a strategy update on Apr 19.

  * Asia – most of the major markets rebounded w/the exception of mainland China: Japan
(TPX +1.34%, NKY +1.14%), Hong Kong (Hang Seng +0.63%, HSCEI +0.62%), mainland China
(SHCOMP -0.43%, Shenzhen -0.25%, CSI 300 -0.24%), Taiwan (TAIEX flat), Korea (KOSPI
+0.35%), Australia (ASX 200 +1.3%), and India (up ~50bp for the major indices). There
weren’t any major macro headlines out of Asia. Within the NKY all major sub-groups saw
gains but healthcare, materials, fins, real estate, and utilities were esp. strong. SUMCO
jumped following pos. sell-side comments (the stock jumped 5.3%). Names levered to
SUMCO rallied in sympathy (Micronics, Advantest, Tokyo Electron, etc.). In Hong Kong, top
performers included Lenovo (+4.1%) and some Macau-linked stocks (Sands China +4.02%,
Galaxy +3.52%, etc.). In Taiwan large-cap tech was mixed (TSMC +0.78%, Hon Hai +0.77%
vs. Largan -1.25%, Catcher -1.5%) and fins underperformed. In Korea chemical stocks were
strong (LG Chem, Lotte Chemical, etc.) while Samsung Electronics rose 0.68%.

#US macro update

  * The bigger picture backdrop remains (frustratingly) unchanged. Healthcare was/is a net
negative for the Thy God-Emperor Trump/Ryan agenda but it is by no means fatal and so long as investors
anticipate some action on the tax front the SPX will struggle to experience significant
weakness (investors appear to appreciate that the tax process is in its very early stages and
thus are willing to wait a few more months for details). The nominal growth backdrop
remains supportive and many think the SPX would be capable of posting ~$133-135 in ’18
EPS w/o anything happening in Washington (the mid-point of that range could support the
SPX at ~2250-2300 which means there isn’t an excessive amount of political hope in
stocks). The biggest risk for the time being really isn’t political (the entire market is closely
scrutinizing Washington and near-term political expectations are low) but instead
concerns growth – sentiment around growth has grown quite upbeat (both towards real
growth and inflation) but also very complacent and risks are rising (widening gap between
surveys and hard data, soft Mar US flash PMIs, soft oil prices, etc.). It’s tough to foresee the
growth narrative turning more positive from present levels and any reversal could undercut
the $133-135 ’18 Washington-neutral EPS range. Keep in mind the calendar is pretty
sparse over the next few weeks – aside from some eco data this Fri (US/EU inflation and
China PMIs), the FOMC minutes (Wed 4/5), the Thy God-Emperor Trump/Xi summit (4/6-7), and US Mar jobs
(Fri 4/7), most investors are now looking towards the upcoming CQ1 earnings season (which
starts Thurs morning 4/13).

#Top Headlines for Tuesday

  * Thy God-Emperor Trump wants to do tax reform and infrastructure together according to Axios. Thy God-Emperor Trump feels
“burned” by the House Freedom Caucus and he knows that combining infrastructure into a
tax bill could help win some support from Democrats. Axios. http://bit.ly/2obRa3v

  * Tax overhaul – 1986 vs. 2017. An AP article looks at the differences between now and ’86 –
“tax overhaul efforts lacks advantages Reagan enjoyed in ‘86”. Reagan was popular and
worked w/powerful and experienced leaders in Congress. All the key principals had
established and trusting relationships. The situation facing President Donald Thy God-Emperor Trump
features none of those advantages. AP http://apne.ws/2mLzUoK

  * Thy God-Emperor Trump’s final tax bill, to the extent he can even achieve one, may look very different from
what he promised on the campaign trail. During the campaign Thy God-Emperor Trump talked about a 15%
corporate tax rate. That was subsequently revised to 15-20% and now people in the WH are
talking about >20%. However, Thy God-Emperor Trump’s final corporate tax rate may be as high as 28% if he
wants his plan to be revenue-neutral. Note that 28% was the same rate proposed by
Obama in ’12-’16. Most on Wall St are assuming a rate of no higher than 25%. NYT
http://nyti.ms/2npLQJV

  * Healthcare – despite the failure of ACHA, Thy God-Emperor Trump and the GOP face a big decision that
could severely undermine the public insurance exchanges. House Republicans filed a
lawsuit in 2014 to block subsides paid to insurers participating in the ACA exchanges but the
case was delayed as Ryan pursued repeal/replace. Thy God-Emperor Trump and Ryan could ask for the
lawsuit to continue as soon as May. Without these subsidies the few insurers still
participating in the exchanges would either exit the market completely or significantly raise
premiums. Even the threat of losing the premiums could have a dramatic effect. Insurers
must decide by June whether to participate in the exchanges next year. WSJ.
http://on.wsj.com/2ntDHpy

  * Schumer and McConnell headed for an “epic” clash over the Supreme Court and
government funding. Schumer is “itching for a fight” and the upcoming Gorsuch
confirmation and Apr 28 funding expiration will give him two great opportunities to wage
battle. Schumer said McConnell may not have the votes needed to break a Gorsuch
filibuster. Politico. http://politi.co/2nH8yz8

  * Republicans prob. won’t include funding for Thy God-Emperor Trump’s Mexico wall in the upcoming budget;
Republicans don’t want a shutdown battle in Apr and thus could exclude wall funding from
the budget as a result – Politico http://politi.co/2ncanQO

  * Thy God-Emperor Trump on Tues to sign an executive order that would begin the process of undoing much
of Obama’s climate agenda – Thy God-Emperor Trump’s order would instruct regulators to rewrite key rules
curbing US carbon emissions, lift a moratorium on federal coal leasing, and remove the
requirement that federal officials consider the impact of climate change when making
decisions. Most of the Thy God-Emperor Trump order will take years to implement and is unlikely to alter
the shift away from coal and towards nat. gas and renewables. Washington Post.
http://wapo.st/2mLwUbQ

  * Thy God-Emperor Trump’s climate order won’t help either energy independence or coal mining employment
– the US already consumes all its own coal and coal mining jobs have been cut by
automation and increased nat. gas demand. NYT http://nyti.ms/2nven2f

  * Company-specific news update from Tues morning. Wolseley is one of the top stocks in
the SXXP after posting solid earnings. Credit Suisse said it would make a decision on capital
“as soon as possible”. Ericsson was hit at the open after issuing a restructuring update but
the stock has since bounced. Redrow said it will not make a bid for Bovis. Two of Tesco’s
largest shareholders are calling on the co to drop its bid for Booker. Akzo Nobel said it
would provide a strategy update on Apr 19.

  * Company-specific news update from Mon night. RHT’s results were strong, esp. the blowout
billings number for the Feb-end Q. SNX also was solid (better Feb-end results and inline
earnings). DRI reported earnings ahead of the St and announced plans to buy Cheddar’s for
$780MM in cash. Red Mountain sent a letter to DECK’s board and called on the co to
explore strategic alternatives. HOMB announced plans to buy SGBK. ALXN named a new
CEO.
 
  * China/semiconductors – Tsinghua Unigroup, China’s largest chipmaker, has secured ~$22B
in financing to pursue M&A and build production capacity. Unigroup is in the process of
building a massive ~$30B memory plant. China in total plans to spend $150B over the next
10 years to secure a leading position in the global semi industry. Bloomberg.
http://bloom.bg/2otzBvd

  * CMCSA – the co is planning to rebrand and expand its streaming TV product. The new
service, which will be marked as Xfinity Instant TV, will cost $15-40/month and will be made
available to the >50MM homes within the CMCSA footprint. Reuters.

  * Bond buyers return w/a vengeance – the WSJ discusses the recent rally in Treasuries as
“Thy God-Emperor Trump Trades” reverse. WSJ. http://on.wsj.com/2otqfQb

  * Italy – despite all the anxiety around Thy God-Emperor Trump and France, the market’s biggest political risk is
still Italy. WSJ. http://on.wsj.com/2ndmKgq

  * Iranian oil minister says global oil cuts deal likely to be extended – Reuters
http://reut.rs/2mLA8fu

 * Bank lending update from JPM’s D Silver - commercial bank lending has cooled notably in
recent months. Bank lending often weakens around recessions, and there has been some
concern over the recent slowing. But there are also a few instances in which bank lending
firmed again after a mid-expansion moderation, and we are not especially alarmed by the
recent slowing in the data. Given many signs that business investment has strengthened
more recently, we think the bank lending data will eventually firm. http://bit.ly/2o16zXg

 * Wall St research – Reuters discusses the “period of turmoil” facing the research industry
due to upcoming regulatory changes. Online research portals could gain share at the
expense of “bulge bracket” investment banks. According to one study, ~40K research
reports are produced every week by the world’s top 15 global investment banks but only 1%
are actually consumed by clients. Reuters http://reut.rs/2oc0Riq

#Washington – what comes next?

 * The next major issue to be addressed in Washington concerns the budget as the present
spending authorization is due to expire on Apr 28 – failure to sign a new budget (or a
Continuing Resolution) by that date could result in a “shutdown”. A shutdown on its own
wouldn’t be a major headache for stocks or the economy although at this time on gov’t
stoppage would probably have negative consequences as it 1) would reinforce the message
sent by the ACHA failure of Washington being hopelessly deadlocked and 2) raise doubts
about Washington acting smoothly on the debt ceiling (the debt ceiling probably doesn’t
have to be raised until later in the summer or early fall).

  * On taxes, the GOP is aggressively pivoting but there is a lot of work left to do. The
Ryan/Brady BAT bill is the only tax legislation that actually exists but (as has the case for
months) this bill can’t pass the Senate; if Ryan insists on commencing the tax debate w/his
BAT blueprint as the base case that could cause months of contentious negotiations and
drag the process into the fall at least (Brady’s House Ways and Means Committee has a
meeting Tues 3/28 at which it will discuss taxes). Thy God-Emperor Trump will play a big role – the White
House largely outsourced healthcare to Ryan but by getting involved early w/taxes it could
help steer the process towards a bill capable of passing both the House and Senate.

  * Without BATs and the ACHA savings it will be very difficult for any tax legislation to be
“revenue neutral” which means the GOP will have to 1) secure some Democratic support in
the Senate to overcome a likely filibuster or 2) sunset any changes after 10 years (like the
George W Bush tax cuts). Erstwhile GOP deficit hawks seem a bit more amenable to
unfinanced tax cuts (Meadows, the chair of the House Freedom Caucus, this weekend said
taxes don’t have to be revenue neutral) but they are unlikely to countenance enormous
deficits.
 

  * The market right now assumes the corporate rate can be cut to ~25% (or lower) when all is
said and done – anything higher than that number is likely to underwhelm. The “easiest”
bill to pass would likely be some combination of a repatriation holiday and infrastructure
spending (this is likely going to be the fallback solution if taxes stay deadlocked into the late
fall) although passing either alone would likely foreclose the possibility of broader tax
action. Markets appreciate that tax reform won’t happen by Aug and most don’t even think
it can happen this year. However, investors are hoping to see a credible and passable
blueprint by the fall that can get to Thy God-Emperor Trump’s desk by early 2018.

#Calendar of events to watch for the week of Mon Mar 27

  * There aren’t many major events scheduled this week other than some eco data (the most
important of which will likely be the US Feb PCE on Fri 3/31) and a few earnings reports.

  * Calendar for Wed 3/29 – the focus will be on the UK triggering of Article 50, US pending
home sales for Feb (10amET), some Fed speakers (Evans, Rosengren, and Williams), some
analyst meetings (ALK, DXC), the Samsung Galaxy S8 launch (in NYC), and earnings (PAYX,
SCWX, UNF pre-open and LULU and WOR after the close).

  * Calendar for Thurs 3/30 – the focus will be on some Fed speakers (Mester, Kaplan, Dudley,
and Williams), analyst meetings (AKAM, TECK), and earnings (SAIC pre-open).

  * Calendar for Fri 3/31 – the focus will be on China’s NBS manufacturing and nonmanufacturing
PMIs for Mar (out Thurs night/Fri morning), the Eurozone CPI for Mar
(5amET), the US personal income/spending/PCE for Feb (8:30amET), the Chicago PMI for
Mar (9:45amET), Michigan confidence numbers for Mar (10amET), and earnings (BBRY preopen).

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 20th, 2020.

# **A blast of earnings news is coming, but the market may be more focused on when the economy will reopen  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/17/a-blast-of-earnings-news-is-coming-but-the-market-may-be-more-focused-on-when-the-economy-will-reopen.html)**
*****
> Earnings from IBM, Netflix, Coca-Cola and dozens of others are expected in the week ahead, but as the state shutdowns now reach the one-month threshold, the market is more likely to trade on virus headlines and news about reopening the economy.
*****
> There are also some important economic reports, including existing home sales on Monday and durable goods on Friday. But it is the weekly jobless claims data that will again be most relevant, as economists watch to see whether the number of workers seeking claims has now peaked and whether there are any signs some are returning to jobs, as government funds reach the hands of business owners.
*****
> In the past week, stocks were higher, but there was a divergence with the Dow up just under 2.2% at 24,242, and Nasdaq, surging 6%, lifted by tech and biotech. The S&P 500 gained 3% for the week and is now 31% off its March lows.
*****
> Stocks gained amid signs the virus outbreak has peaked and some reopenings could start slowly in the next few weeks.
*****
> The market also bounced Friday as the results of an early study of a Gilead drug showed promise with severe cases of coronavirus. Technology stocks were up about 4% for the week, and health care was up more than 5% while consumer discretionary stocks led with a gain of more than 6%.
*****
> “As the virus news goes, so go risk assets. People expect bad economic data,” said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist at Incapital. “The data is all expected to be horrible. The only economic data we can really look at now and start to measure is the claims data on Thursday.” As of April 11, more than 22 million workers claimed unemployment benefits over a four-week period, as states shut down and schools, restaurants, stores and many other businesses closed or were forced to cut back.
*****
> Charts are important
> Analysts who watch stock charts say technical levels will continue to have a powerful pull on the market, since so many traders have set their computers to trade around those numbers.
*****
> For instance, the S&P 500 had a hard time breaking through the 50-day moving average Friday, and fell back after it initially edged near 2,862 in morning trading. But at the end of the trading day, it smashed through that level, surging to close at 2,874, a positive sign for Monday’s open. The 50-day literally is the average closing price for the S&P over the previous 50 sessions. Technical analysts believe watching moving averages gives them an important tool for price trends and momentum.
*****
> Bob Doll, Nuveen’s chief equity strategist, said he believes the market hit its bear market low on March 23, but it could take another dive towards lows at some point.
*****
> “My [low] target was 2,350. We spent 36 hours below that and got to 2,192. If there’s a secondary low, then probably the lowest chance is 2,350,” he said. “I’m not sure we’re going to go there, based on two things, the power of the rally and two, the stimulus. It’s been awesome.”
*****
> Travelers, and Texas Instruments release results Tuesday. AT&T, Delta Airlines, and Intel, Blackstone and Eli Lily are reporting Thursday. American Express and Verizon are expected Friday.
*****
> Doll said he expects the market to listen to comments from corporate executives on conference calls but ignore the actual earnings. “The market is going to pay a lot more attention to what can a rebound look like, and what can 2021 numbers look like,” he said. “They’ll be selling on that versus how deep is the hole going to be in the second quarter. The macro questions around that are recurrence, therapeutics, and vaccine and how fast can the economy come back, and nobody knows the answer to that.”
*****
> President Donald Trump laid out guidelines for reopening the economy, but left the decision making up to the states, which are facing varied levels of new infections. One issue is the lack of testing, and American businesses have pressed for more availability of test kits so workers can be brought back more safely.
*****
> Doll said he is partial to health care and technology stocks, and one reason is because of the Fed’s quantitative easing programs. “We’re now in QE4. We had QE1, QE2, QE3, and six months after QE 1, 2 and 3, there were two sectors that outperformed-technology and health care, and there were two that underperformed, utilities and REITs,” he said.
*****
> Doll said he also is looking at how stocks might come through the virus shutdowns. “Part of what you want to make sure is the company is going to make it through, and make sure the industry has decent demand getting out of it. If it has decent demand during it, that’s a good thing, and that takes you back to health care and technology,” said Doll.
*****
> Leary said he expects companies to be scrutinized somewhat differently by analysts this quarter, and balance sheets will be more important.
*****
> “Its going to be on a case-by-case basis about how analysts are going to look at them. This is not a typical recession. Recessions seem to hit different sectors,” he said, “This one one is different in that it really has several losers like airlines and travel and entertainment companies. It has some real winners too. I like health care and pharma. Anything that’s defensive in nature is going to perform well.”
*****
> Companies have been tapping the corporate bond market at a record pace to boost their cash piles to help them through the economy’s shutdown, and the coming week should be no different.
*****
> The corporate debt market has been open for business and spreads have narrowed since the Fed announced a program to buy corporate debt. Companies have issued more than $160 billion in investment grade bonds so far this month, with JP Morgan issuing $10 billion this past week in the biggest bank deal ever, according to Credit Flow Research.
*****
> More are expected in the coming week, as companies report earnings and exit the blackout period.
*****
> “I think what corporate treasurers know is the window of opportunity for issuing debt at reasonable rates will quickly close once the economy starts opening,” said Leary. He said balance sheets and earnings will be more scrutinized once things start to become more normal.
*****
> “They won’t have an excuse anymore ... right now, everything is expected to unexpected,” he said, “I think that window will close, and we’ll have to take a look at the bond market again. Their ability to issue will be impacted by their balance sheets...[now] there’s plenty of cash coming at them. The Fed will step in to support.”
*****
> Leary said some of the interest in corporate bonds is from investors who are fearful of buying stocks right now but may want to invest in a company through the safer play of its bonds. Leary said energy bonds are among the least desirable, with the huge drop in crude prices.
*****
> West Texas Intermediate crude futures for May settled at $18.72 per barrel, it lowest level since January, 2002. But that contract expires Tuesday. The June contract settled at $25.08 per barrel, and will resume trading there next week as the active contract.
*****
> “It’s just a reflection of physical market conditions,” said John Kilduff of Again Capital, of the big decline in the May contract. He said it shows that futures traders do not want to actually take delivery of the commodity, due to an increasing lack of storage space.

# How Markets Performed During the Spanish Flu

> With equities surging into the close ahead of the weekend, traders are shrugging their shoulders wondering how the hell the market is rallying given the economic damage inflicted by the COVID-19 outbreak, which has been cited as the worst pandemic to hit the United States since the 1918 Spanish flu. This leads to the question, how did the stock market perform during the Spanish flu outbreak? The chart below compares the performance of the DJIA to the weekly mortality rate of the Spanish flu during each of the waves of that pandemic from mid-1918 through early 1919 (as cited in a WSJ article earlier today).

> Looking at how the outbreak of the Spanish flu played out, there were basically three different waves of the virus (red line). The first wave in the summer of 1918 was a relatively mild one compared to the other two, and the DJIA's performance during that wave was essentially flat as it never declined more than 3%. The real damage from the Spanish flu was in the fall of 1918 when the mortality rate spiked up as high as 24 per 1,000 people per week. During that wave of the pandemic, which also came in the thick of a post-WWI recession, the DJIA peaked just as the wave was getting underway and fell for the next three months. Even with the severity of the outbreak during that wave, though, the DJIA never fell more than 11% from peak to trough. On a comparative basis, even after the 28% rally over the last four weeks, the S&P 500 is still down 15% from its high. Obviously, comparing two periods more than 100 years apart is hardly an apples to apples comparison, but it's still interesting that during what was an even deadlier pandemic in 1918, the DJIA never even approached anything close to a bear market.

> Looking at the chart, the DJIA's low of the decline coincided with the second wave of the outbreak just as the third (more mild) wave of the pandemic was getting underway. Furthermore, during that third wave, the DJIA kicked off what was a strong rally of more than 25% in less than three months on optimism over an end to the outbreak.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/041720-DJIA-flue.png))**

> So, once the mortality rate of the Spanish flu dropped down to zero, it must have been nothing but clear skies ahead for the Dow, right? Well, not necessarily. When it comes to the stock market, there's always something. Less than a year after the mortality rate from the Spanish flu dropped down to zero, the US economy actually went into a year and a half long recession. That contraction was so severe that it has been dubbed the Depression of 1920/21, one where unemployment topped 10% and deflation was as high as 18%! The bear market that accompanied that recession was also severe as the DJIA declined 46%. Imagine coming out of a pandemic with nothing more than an 11% correction and then getting socked with that!

# Silver Shining in the Near Term, Gold Shining Over the Long Term

> Gold (GLD) has had an interesting run over the past year. Last spring, the ETF for the yellow metal finally pressed above multiyear resistance roughly around $130. After surging through late summer, GLD continued its rally at the end of 2019 and early 2020 before turning sharply lower alongside stocks in March. But since its March 19th low it has gone on to rally over 17% as of today and is now at its highest levels since early 2013.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/GLD.png))**

> Another precious metal, Silver (SLV), has not been as fortunate. Although it shared in the rally last spring and summer, SLV has yet to eclipse its early September highs. While gold had broken out again in February and March, silver put in a lower high before plummeting to its lost level since 2009 in mid-March.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/SLV.png))**

> But since that low on March 18th, SLV has actually outperformed rising 27.83%. Gold is up only up 15.14% since that same day and 17% since its respective low one day later on March 19th. While the S&P 500's (SPY) low was not put in place until a few days after gold and silver on March 23rd, since March 18th, SLV is also outperforming SPY's 15.97% gain.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/Performance-1.png))**

> Over the long term, though SLV is still the worst performer of the group. As shown in the chart below, SLV is down 8.84% over the past two years while the S&P 500's gains have also been somewhat lackluster thanks to the most recent sell-off with only a 4.11% gain. Gold, on the other hand, has outshined the other two having surged 26.93%.

# It’s Earnings Season (Or Whatever it is Companies Plan to Report)

> It’s that time of year again. The time when corporate America reports financial results for the prior three months. Normally, we call it earnings season, but given the fact that most of the US economy has been shut down and no timetable is set for when it re-opens, for a lot of companies out there, there really isn’t much in the way of earnings, revenues, or guidance to speak of. Instead, this reporting period will likely be a lot of companies trying to put the best spin on how much (or little) cash they have on hand to withstand the shutdown.

> Besides the major banks and financials, there hasn’t been a whole lot in the way of reports to speak of, but of the results we have seen, the stock market reaction hasn’t been great as companies like Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), JP Morgan (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), Bank of America (BAC), and Goldman Sachs (GS) have all seen negative reactions to their reports. The only large-cap that has really reacted positively to earnings so far is UnitedHealth (UNH) which gained more than 4%. Next week, the pace of reports will pick up, but the peak period for reports won’t be for another two weeks when more than 300 companies will report in a single day.

# Typical April Trading: Strength from Start to Finish

> April, the last month of DJIA & S&P 500 “Best Six Months,” has a strong historical track record. April 1999 was the first month DJIA gained over 1000 points (10.25%). April is also DJIA’s best month since 1950 with an average 1.9% gain. After a disastrous March, the rally than began in late March has extended in April. As of yesterday’s close, DJIA is up 7.39% so far this April. S&P 500 is up 8.32%, NASDAQ has risen 10.81%. Small caps, measured by the Russell 2000 have not fared as well, up just 2.17%.

> April’s historical performance over the recent 21-year period is plotted in the chart above (21-year average is on the left vertical scale) compared to April 2020 (right vertical scale). Magnitude of gains this year is substantial however, the trend this year has been similar to past years. Should the current trend remain intact, further gains this month are possible. Coronavirus uncertainty remains extremely elevated, but there does to be some light flickering at the end of tunnel.

Inflation too high! Recession is coming! SPY going back to $229 soon!,32,tkbxsv,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tkbxsv/inflation_too_high_recession_is_coming_spy_going/,30,2022-03-23 01:42:28,"My as\*. SPY goes to $500 in 6 months.

No one wants to put their money in a high-inflation environment for a measly 2% bond return when inflation is 20%. Stock market is the only place to go now (and may be housing?).

In the long run, inflation +20% implies that AAPL most likely will +20% too. If you think they will still selling an iPad for $329 in one year, then you don't know what inflation means. Higher inflation means higher price for everything, including tech items. Big tech companies will brrr both with and without money printer.

Dividend stocks will also perform well during high-inflation period (next 2 years at least), so we may just pick up some VZ shares while it is still low.

Companies that are not yet in profit? Well, these are the companies that may stay low for some period of time.

The Fed starts QT soon? Yeah, the stock market will fall, but we have mid-term election coming during end of this year. I don't think Biden will allow JPow performs large-scale QT beforehand, so the effect will be minimum.

Tldr; Bears are f\*cked. Just like my puts are going to toilet, bearish position now will suffer more in a month than bullish position during past 3 months."

To help you YOLO your money away, here are all of the tickers mentioned in all the posts within the past 24 hours (and links to their Yahoo Finance page):

Note: this is a trial run. I plan on correcting the formatting to shrink the length down for tomorrow and will eventually add sentiment analysis ranking frustration, bullish/bearish, etc.  In addition, I’m still working on ways to weed out non-tickets (see URL in this case). It’s quite difficult when tickers are mentioned without the $.

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Wednesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/17/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-february-17-2021.html)

*****

> # 1. Stocks set to open flat after Dow closes at another record

> * U.S. stock futures were steady Wednesday as Wall Street remained on track for its best monthly performance since November. A mixed session Tuesday saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average close at another record. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq broke their two-day winning streaks with small losses, falling from previous session record high closes.

> * On Wednesday’s economic calendar, the Commerce Department is set to issue January retail sales at 8:30 a.m. ET, one hour before the opening bell. Economists expect a 1.2% increase after a 0.7% December decline. At the same time, the Labor Department’s January look at producer prices is seen rising 0.4% after a 0.3% gain in December.

*****

> # 2. B/itcoin soars to new high, topping $51,000 for first time

> * B/itcoin smashed through $51,000 to hit a new all-time high Wednesday. Major financial companies appear to be warming to b/itcoin, while Tesla and other firms have also shown support for the c/ryptocurrency. B/itcoin’s latest rally is reminiscent of its massive ascent to nearly $20,000 in 2017, which was followed by an 80% plunge the following year. However, the world’s biggest c/ryptocurrency did stage a fierce comeback since, more than quadrupling in 2020 and gaining over 70% since the start of this year.

*****

> # 3. Here are Warren Buffett-run Berkshire’s stock moves last quarter

> * Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway bought stakes worth $4.1 billion in Chevron and $8.6 billion in Verizon shares during the fourth quarter, according to the conglomerate’s latest 13-F filing with the SEC. Berkshire also sold its stakes in drug maker Pfizer and JPMorgan Chase, while trimming its Wells Fargo position. While still its biggest holding, Berkshire continued to trim its lucrative Apple stake, cutting it by about 6%. Four times a year, investors file their long positions with the government. The information is released to the public 45 days after each quarter ends.

*****

> # 4. Elon Musk’s SpaceX valuation jumps to about $74 billion

> * SpaceX completed another monster equity funding round of $850 million last week, people familiar with the financing told CNBC, sending the company’s valuation skyrocketing 60% from its previous raise in August to about $74 billion. Elon Musk, who also co-founded Tesla, saw insiders and existing investors in his commercial space company selling an additional $750 million in a secondary transaction, one of the people said. SpaceX did not immediately respond to CNBC’s request for comment on this report.

*****

> # 5. Millions in Texas still without power as new storm hits

> * Millions of residents in Texas were still in the dark Wednesday with no indication when their service might return as another winter storm moved across the southern part of the nation. In all, between 2 million and 3 million customers in the energy capital of the U.S. had no power — two days after historic snow and single-digit temperatures created a surge in demand for electricity for heat.

> * Wholesale power and natural gas prices soared in recent days. However, natural gas futures dropped early Wednesday. U.S. oil prices kept up their advance Wednesday, gaining more than 1% and pushing above $61 per barrel, levels not seen since the early days of the coronavirus pandemic.

#**DISCUSS!**

What's on everyone's radar for today's trading day ahead here at r/wallstreetbets?

# **I hope you all have an excellent trading day ahead today on this Wednesday, February 17th, 2021! :)**"
Why I hope you're jacked to the tits with SPY puts: Modeling SARS-CoV-2 infections in the U.S. feat. latest Western data,64,fij063,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fij063/why_i_hope_youre_jacked_to_the_tits_with_spy_puts/,48,2020-03-14 19:46:38,"TL;DR if you're looking for a short analysis, fuck off  
**$SPY 230p april17** <- your life savings go there (250p if you're from /r/investing)

Hey, this started out as a very simple, very shitty calculation that I did for myself in a few minutes. But since my portfolio grew about 1000% in 16 days thanks to WSB, I figured I could as well share it with you guys.

The following is a very shitty modeling of the number of infected people in the US based on two sources that you could've done in 5 minutes if you weren't lazy. It's not very different from all the other calculations, but it's been updated with the latest data and uses metrics from Western countries.

For extreme simplicity (I know you retards won't read the rest):  
22% growth daily ~ Italy after quarantine  
35% growth daily ~ Italy before quarantine

#[THIS IS WHERE YOU CLICK](https://i.imgur.com/HDLTlip.png)

---

#A few things to keep in mind:

- the number of infections later on is obviously bullshit, the US will take extreme measures far before it reaches 125 million infections
- Italy has some seriously good healthcare, 40% of you guys can't even afford a fucking dental checkup
- all this is assuming the US won't use extreme draconian China-like measures. Anyway, if they do, $SPY goes to shit anyway, so it's a win-win situation
- all this is assuming we won't be seeing a vaccine/treatment soon (so keep an eye on Remdesivir or Chloroquine/Hydroxychloroquine, which Poland started using as official treatment yesterday and southeastern Asian countries have been using it for quite a while)
- I am European and I don't even have a high school degree; feel free to insult
- the virus is VERY context/culture dependent, the numbers are VERY different in various countries - thus the data I present you is based on Western culture (Western Europe) - for example, Taiwan (where everyone wears masks because they cost 20 cents) has only 50 confirmed cases/1 death and they are literally part of China /s
- (the measures Taiwan had to take very early on to get these insanely good numbers are [here](https://cdn.jamanetwork.com/ama/content_public/journal/jama/0/jvp200035supp1_prod.pdf?Expires=2147483647&Signature=bIZCLS7ZLWTJd%7EU%7EH40JgiEGdFb3ggVUJpBvJ7KdANK7HgK1zaj4uWHvqweGym1nWfO%7EnXt9Y5i1vX79pF7zjjqfzmJAy3udTdpVVZQe07xnQIPcBMXLwZ5XjgTO8yKFXVIpxsXhrmOu8sGSpKiEmQ86ZCKfOTar7fMAGmUCtjiYVFwf31K3REWAA-r3hZyoZpqz3QKpVgpsRpF9fV9thQCq0%7EyvbvRKTH4PcoB%7ECZgmXH7rpVb6bILXQn5zBCphf6pyLAa4zIebUEKfCdCYdSdi9LeIEUsesqsYpNWgHJcr4K1LC0hFlst0RHQz-vZ7I-OvrX%7E5jel6zjjtuDQzjQ__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA) or twitter mirror [here](https://twitter.com/eric_khun/status/1238302647620255745?s=3))
- there is obviously a number of other macroeconomic factors: the price of oil; the fact that it's election year in the US (keep that in mind when considering Trump's actions); rising Middle East tensions; possible growth of loan defaults/bank failures/financial crisis

#Data sources:

- the starting data is taken from an unofficial source, because the CDC is always at least 1 day behind. The CDC currently reports 1629 cases (number from Thursday 4pm), my source reports 2333 as of today (Saturday) - the CDC usually catches up to this site in a day: https://coronavirus.1point3acres.com/en
- the growth data (either 0.22 or 0.35 per day) is taken from this fella here: http://nrg.cs.ucl.ac.uk/mjh/covid19/ 
- it was previously speculated that the numbers double in 3-4 days; 22-35% daily seems to be the most accurate data we have from Western countries (35% is the early Italy/current Spain scenario, 22% is the late Italy scenario with all the serious measures)
- I used two starting numbers for today (Saturday), 2333 and 4666, because I strongly believe that due to a lack of testing in the US, 2333 is a grossly underestimated number

Why Deutsche Telekom has a 132% to 194% stock price potential (and is a better buy than $TMUS),63,m25ors,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m25ors/why_deutsche_telekom_has_a_132_to_194_stock_price/,39,2021-03-11 00:38:53,"Dear fellow retards and crayon-eating apes,

Today I would like to present you my first DD of a German DAX company: Deutsche Telekom, the mother company of $TMUS, which got recently included in the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio by legend Warren Buffett. I would like to show you why I think that Deutsche Telekom is even a better buy than §TMUS.

**1) Solid figures, strong strategic market position, and growth outlook. Main growth drivers are an increasing glass fiber rollout potential and its 5G/cell tower portfolio.**

Deutsche Telekom is the biggest European integrated telecommunications company, with some 242 million mobile customers, 27 million fixed-network lines, and 22 million broadband lines. Deutsche Telekom is present in more than 50 countries, with its main business in Germany and US. On February 26, 2021 the Deutsche Telekom published its results for the 2020 financial year:

* Increase in **revenue of 25.4 percent to 120.1 bn. $ /101.0 billion euros**
* Adjusted **EBITDA AL increased by 41.6 percent to 41.7 bn. $/ 35.0 billion euros**
* **+388,000 broadband customer** additions in Germany
* Larger T-Mobile US records **5.5 million postpaid customer additions**
* Guidance for 2021: **adjusted EBITDA AL of around 37 billion euros** (44.1$) and **free cash flow AL of around 8.0 billion euros (9.5 $)**

The **earnings forecast shows a growth of roughly 13.2% per yea**r over the next years. The general outlook is positive.

**2) Market capitalization of Deutsche Telekom is far below its fair value with a 132 to 194% stock price potential**

Based on 2020 figures, the industry ratio of market capitalization and annual revenue for the big US players lies in a range between 1.24x to 2.24x, with a Top 3 average of 1.77x:

* **$TMUS T-Mobile US**: 153.2 bn. $ market cap / 68.4 bn. € annual revenue (2020) with market cap/revenue ratio of **2.24x**
* **$ VZ Verizon Communications:** 234.5 bn. $ market cap / 128.3 bn. $ revenue (2020) with market cap/revenue ratio of **1.83x**
* **$T AT&T Inc.**: 212.8 bn $ market cap / 171.8 $ revenue (2020) with market cap/revenue ratio of **1.24x**
* **Deutsche Telekom:** 91.5 bn. $ market cap / 120.1 bn. $ revenue (2020) with market cap/revenue ratio of **0.76x**

A fair value for Deutsche Telekom based on the Top 3 industry average of 1.77x would lead to a **fair share price of** **44.64$/37,53€,** which is a **premium of 132%** compared to the current share prices of 19.22$/16,16€. Applying the ratio of its subsidiary §TMUS of 2.24x would even lead to a **stock price potential of 194% resulting in 56.5$/47.50€ share price**. The price-to-earnings ratio is 17.6x and below the industry average of 25.3x (source: [simplywall.st](https://simplywall.st/)).

**3) The market capitalization of US subsidiary TMUS is worth 65.9 bn.$ - so the remaining business of Deutsche Telekom is worth half its revenue!**

After the Sprint-merger, Deutsche Telekom owns 43% of all shares of its subsidiary TMUS, with an option to buy the remaining 8% from Softbank until June 2024 (half of the shares for 06/2020 TMUS stock price of roughly 100$). Based on today’s value, the TMUS participation is worth 65.9 bn. $, which is already 72% of Deutsche Telekom's overall market cap. So, the remaining international business of DT with **51.7 bn. $ revenue is only evaluated 25.6 bn. $!**

**4) The analyst outlook is very promising, showing a conservative 27% upside potential over the next 12 months**

Based on 13 analyst reports, the 12 months forecast shows a possbile stock price of 24,40$/20,50€, which is a premium of roughly 27% to today's stock price. The range across all analysts is between 20.23$ (Deutsche LB) and 29,25$ (JP Morgan Chase) including 12 Buy and 1 Hold recommendations.

**5) A high dividend yield of roughly 4% over the past 20 years makes it the most stable and reliable German dividend stock.**

**6)** **Risks:**

To me, a comprehensive DD should also cover the risks involved, especially when outlook and forecast seems too good to be true,

* During the dot-com bubble, Deutsche Telekom showed a crazy race towards its ATH of 120$/100€ in 2000, followed by a crash down to 12$/10€ within the next two years. This led to trauma for many German shareholders, resulting in lethargic stock performance over the past 18 years. The high dividend yield is also a result of this crash, with management trying to please the remaining stock owners. Since DT is a German symbol of the dot-com bubble, there might be a chance that the stock is simply not reacting to the current, positive news.
* Deutsche Telekom has a high net debt of 127.4 bn. $/107.1 bn. € (2020). However, the recurring cash flow is high, covering roughly 22.2% of its debt. The interest payments are fully covered by the profit (3.1x coverage).
* Currently, 14.5% of all shares are owned by the German government which might hamper potential positive share price developments. However, German economics minister Peter Altmeier is considering reducing the German participation (January 2021). Other privatization cases show a positive stock price effect.

**Summary:**

Based on all information available, I believe that the upside potential overweighs possible downsides. Even a conservative estimate of 24,40$/20,50€ target stock price reflects a 27% price premium. I personally believe that a **fair estimate based on financial analysis would be 44.64$/37,53€, resulting in a 132% stock price performance**. Overall, I am not a financial advisor, and this is not a financial advice. I simply like the stock."

"""Old broad market, dollar cost averaging indexing strategy w/ few blue chip boomer stocks""",0,ref3xi,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ref3xi/old_broad_market_dollar_cost_averaging_indexing/,35,2021-12-12 08:09:49,"New here. Can someone please give input:

Broad-Based Index? A broad-based index is **designed to reflect the movement of a group of stocks or an entire market**. The broad-based index with the fewest stocks is the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), with just 30 stocks included in the index 

Specific indexes or any index will do?

Any other good boomer value stocks?

Home Depot, Visa, McDonalds, JP Morgan, AT&T, Johnson and Johnson, Exxon Mobile, Walmart, etc.  GE, KO, T, VZ, PG, XOM , CVX, ABBV, MO, KMI, DOW, F.m, BRK.B

This is a long term holding strategy, but what to do to make passive income from trading so that you have capital to invest long term?

Is cryp or stocks better.....where to start"

Dividend comparable. $NVTS may be Irish competitor (different kind of chips). Check charts and be  prepared to wait a quarter/year? And if Intel can finally make chips \*in the US\* then that will be something?

$LUMN -- Old telecom company becoming a fiber / cybersecurity company. Partner with VMware; High dividend; dividend not increasing yet due to transition?

$NTAP -- Maybe. Again and still. Old Burry pick still ""performing."" Safe dividend; dividend not increasing due to acquisitions?; a small cloud that services bigger clouds (incl. Amazon)

$TR -- Mostly family and institutionally owned. Long term charts suggest this is a stock that is shorted just enough to cause a gradual increase in price. (EDIT: Afterthought I wish I had earlier. It's a candy company. So it's also a super commodity cycle play--How much does it cost to get to the center of the Tootsie Pop?)

$U -- Swing trade on good ""days/weeks"" and potential growth stock after bad sentiment / earlier profiteers sell down

$VZ -- So long as no black swan event, stable stock with a nice dividend. HODL or swing trade it? Dividend is almost too nice for telecom; unsure if ""competitors"" such as switching to Mint Mobile affect the bottom line, as these are just third-party buyers of wholesale ""cellular bandwidth"" (from the same cell carriers). Be careful in this market though, might see if you can buy back at $51.50 or DCA that dividend over time/inflation

&#x200B;

\*\*\* If you like ""buy high and sell higher"" strategy \*\*\*

$MO and $IRM (but check your charts for levels first). Good dividends, $MO increasing dividend as tobacco/commodity?

\---

Save for later: $EBAY. Has much room to run and a misunderstood/misvalued play in e-commerce competition

\---

Support for the company but trying to find a bottom: $BFI (fuck Shake Shack, and sorry Dorsey $SQ has a deal to cash back in Beecorn for purchases). More on BurgerFi later, if anyone wants a deep value case (find one in your state and enjoy, puts on vegans)

Beecorn DCA and/or grid trade for finite, hard sound money. Generational long term play. DigiByte for later after the rich own all the Beecorn. More on DGB later, if anyone wants a deep value case"

#Trading Update

* What’s happening this morning? There wasn’t any major news out overnight (once again).
Most of the financial media is discussing themes and trends that have been present for
weeks – reflation sustainability, inflation firming, central bank tightening schedules,
expansionary fiscal policies (US, Germany, Japan, etc.), US politics (prospect of tax passage,
etc.), etc. A lot of the commentary seems to have a skeptical tone with regards to the
weeks-long reflation moves and this doubt continues to act as kindling for the recent
market shifts (positioning and sentiment are playing a role too, esp. as we head into the
final days of the month and quarter – recall many had prepared for the SPX to trade poorly
in H2:Aug but the opposite happened and the index is now up ~3.7% from its 8/21 low. This
has undoubtedly spurred some chasing along the way). As far as Thurs morning trading,
things are relatively subdued this morning. Asia’s major indices saw mixed price action –
TPX +0.71%, NKY +0.47%, Hang Seng -0.8%, SHCOMP -0.17%, Taiwan TAIEX -0.29%, Korea
KOSPI +0.02%, Australia +0.11%, and India +0.1%. There weren’t many huge themes in Asia
although the USD rally is creating some anxiety (the DXY surged Mon-Wed and is flattish so
far Thurs). Tech stocks in Taiwan were mixed-to-down small. Europe’s major equity
indices are flat-to-up small. Banks remain the big upside standouts (both in Europe and the
US) as this group more than any other encapsulates the global reflation sentiments (banks,
tech, industrials are outperforming in Europe this morning while basic resources, retail, and
utilities lag. H&M is one of the weakest stocks in Europe on back of earnings while the USD
strength is hitting basic resources). The Treasury weakness continues as 10yr yields rise a
further ~3-4bp so far Thurs morning (10yr yields are higher throughout Europe too). US S&P
futures are flat-to-down small.
* Calendar of events for Thurs 9/28 – the focus will be on German inflation for Sept (8amET),
the BOE “20 Years On” conf. in London (at which Carney will speak), US Q2 data revisions
(8:30amET), US advance goods trade balance for Aug (8:30amET), Fed speakers (George,
Fischer, Bostic), Gary Cohn’s interview on CNBC’s Squawk Box (during the 8amET hour),
Paul Ryan’s interview on CNBC’s Squawk Box, Brady’s comments on tax reform, analyst
meetings (AEE and AFL), and earnings (ACN, BBRY, CAG, MKC, MTN, and RAD pre-open and
KBH and SGH after the close).
* Calendar of events for Fri 9/29 – the focus will be on the China Caixin manufacturing PMI
for Sept (Thurs night/Fri morning), the German jobs data for Sept (3:55amET), Eurozone CPI
for Sept (5amET), US personal income/spending for Aug (8:30amET), the US PCE for Aug
(8:30amET), the Chicago PMI for Sept (9:45amET), the final Michigan Confidence numbers
for Sept (10amET), Fed speakers (Harker), and analyst meetings (CMP).
* Calendar going forward – there aren’t many major scheduled events on the calendar until
CQ3 earnings (the week of 10/16 is the first busy one of the season) aside from a few eco
numbers (including the US Aug PCE Fri 9/29 and the US Sept jobs report Fri 10/6). The
market largely appreciates that tax will be a CQ1:18 event and thus isn’t looking for anything
substantive on that front over the coming months. The next big monetary policy events
include the ECB (10/26), BOE (11/2), and anything on the Fed staffing front (i.e. when does
 Thy God-Emperor Trump make a decision on Yellen?).

#Top Headlines for Thursday

* US politics – there wasn’t anything incremental overnight but a ton of postmortem articles
were published on the events this week (tax unveil, Alabama run-off, Corker retirement,
healthcare failure, etc.). The tone of most of these articles is cautious with regards to the
outlook for the GOP and the party’s agenda – “Alabama defeat weakens and isolates
 Thy God-Emperor Trump as his problems grow” (http://wapo.st/2xDxquK), “Bannon focused on repeating
Alabama, challenging incumbent Republicans across the country” (http://politi.co/2ybnL1C),
“Political disruption helps fuel GOP’s woes” (http://on.wsj.com/2wYIYH4), “Tues was a
disastrous day for the whole GOP” (http://on.wsj.com/2fsuf0C), “GOP pitches deep tax cuts,
w/few details on paying for them” (http://wapo.st/2yuPgPV), “ Thy God-Emperor Trump/GOP tax plan omits
details on who pays” (http://politi.co/2yvcKEH), “ Thy God-Emperor Trump and his congressional allies are
about to make the trajectory of debt even worse” (http://on.wsj.com/2fsuTLB), etc.
*  Sen. Bob Corker says tax reform will make healthcare look like ‘a piece of cake’ –
The Hill http://bit.ly/2wlgLus
*  Healthcare/ACA – insurers decide to stay in the ACA exchanges for ’18 despite fears
of broad exits – WSJ http://on.wsj.com/2yIx4D8.
*  TWTR more effective than FB in disrupting US election - there is evidence that
Twitter may have been used even more extensively than Facebook in the Russian
influence campaign last year – NYT http://nyti.ms/2yuUTgW
*  Internet execs (from FB, GOOGL, and TWTR) have been asked to testify before
Congress in the coming weeks – Reuters http://reut.rs/2fTffK4
*   Thy God-Emperor Trump’s pick to head the DOJ’s antitrust division gets approved by the Senate –
Bloomberg https://bloom.bg/2yttKeo
* All about reflation and rotation: what happened on Wed. US stocks saw solid gains overall
on Wed but the bigger story was ongoing rotation as the SPX’s ~40bp advance was
somewhat overshadowed by the ~2% ramp in the R2K, the ~1.6% climb in the BKX, the 75-
130bp decline in both staples and utilities, the 7bp increase in 10yr yields, and the ~50bp
DXY advance. The latest phase of the reflation trade kicked off back on 9/11 and is now in
its 3rd week, encouraged along the way by firmer global inflation readings (China, India, UK,
US, etc.), hawkish central banks actions/rhetoric (FOMC, BOC, BOE, etc.), and pro-growth
policies in the US (the GOP tax blueprint). Thus it isn’t that stocks rallied solely in response
to the Republican tax unveil but instead that blueprint helped to exacerbate existing
reflation tendencies. Most of the big sectoral moves comported w/the reflation playbook
as small caps and financials (esp. banks/brokers) did very well while staples, REITs, utilities,
and telecoms lagged. Tech was something of an outlier – normally super-cap tech would
lag during big reflation trades but that wasn’t necessarily the case on Wed.
* Economic data/monetary policy update for Thurs 9/28. It was a pretty slow morning of
news on this front. GfK consumer confidence in Germany for Oct softened slightly (it came
in at 10.8 vs. the St 11). Some of the regional inflation numbers in Germany for Sept
showed firming M/M (the full German inflation number will hit at 8amET). Eurozone
confidence numbers for Sept came in relatively solid this morning (http://bit.ly/2fB5gMz).
The New Zealand rate decision was largely as expected (http://bit.ly/2fsBZQb).
o Fed’s Rosengren called for “regular and gradual” rate hikes as disinflationary
pressures appear temporary while labor markets continue to tighten – Bloomberg
https://bloom.bg/2xD4Tpa
* North Korea tensions/challenges – North Korean provocations could increase in Oct,
Chinese exports of food to NK spike, US to rotate strategic military assets into South Korea.
o North Korea is likely to engage in more provocative behavior in Oct to coincide
w/the founding of the North Korean community party and China’s Communist Party
Congress. South Korea’s national security adviser Chung Eui-yong said he expected
Pyongyang to act around Oct. 10 and 18 – Reuters http://reut.rs/2k6dgX1
o US strategic assets to be rotated into South Korea – the will send “strategic”
military assets to South Korea on a more regular basis to better deter North Korea –
Washington Post http://wapo.st/2yIoLHu
o China’s agricultural exports to North Korea spiked in Jul and Aug; the increase in
food shipments shows the resilience of ties between the two countries – WSJ
http://on.wsj.com/2xHTq9F
* Japan election outcome grows cloudier as Party of Hope gathers strength - the biggest
opposition Democratic Party on Thurs said it would step aside to let its candidates run under
the Party of Hope banner – Reuters http://reut.rs/2fsHYVk
* Brexit negotiations – there are signs of a thawing in the EU-UK Brexit negotiation process as
the EU makes a small concession – Bloomberg http://bit.ly/2wYsLlj
* Company-specific news update for Thurs morning 9/28 – there are a few items in focus this
morning including Toshiba/Bain, H&M, EFX, HAIN, and more.
o Toshiba – a deal is (finally) signed – Toshiba struck a formal deal to sell its memory
unit to a Bain-led group for $17.7B. The Bain consortium includes AAPL, Dell, STX,
Hoya, and Hynix. The two sides hope to close the transaction by Mar. WSJ.
http://on.wsj.com/2wYGopc
o STX announces details on its participation in the Toshiba deal; STX has committed
to provide up to $1.25 billion in financing to support the acquisition. Seagate
expects to enter into a long-term NAND supply agreement with Toshiba Memory
that will provide continuity of raw NAND for Seagate's expanding SSD product
portfolio. Seagate expects this transaction to be accretive to its earnings.
o AAPL not giving up fully on LCDs – AAPL could wind up buying advanced LCD panels
from Japan Display next year, suggesting the co doesn’t plan on shifting its entire
product lineup to OLED. WSJ. http://on.wsj.com/2wm6EWp
o HAIN strikes agreement w/activist Engaged Capital – the agreement will overhaul
the board and potentially opens the door to a sale of the company (the board will
form a group to consider strategic alternatives). WSJ. http://on.wsj.com/2xLOzo1
o EFX – the co’s acting CEO has an editorial in the WSJ this morning – “On behalf of
Equifax, I’m sorry” – the article announces a series of steps and actions aimed at
rectifying the fallout from the recent hack. http://on.wsj.com/2yvbLUX
o H&M – the stock is one of the weakest in all of Europe after reporting disappointing
earnings.
o HUN, Clariant – White Tale Holdings, the activist group seeking to block the merger,
has increased its stake in Clariant slightly – Reuters http://reut.rs/2xCiooZ
* Company-specific news update from Wed night 9/27. There wasn’t anything major other
than a few SMID-cap earnings (CMTL, JBL, PIR, PRGS, and THO) and none were particularly
controversial. JBL beat for its FQ4/Aug period and while FQ1/Nov EPS was guided a bit
under the St this stock has already come off a decent amount from its highs on the recent
AAPL anxiety (and thus should be fine off the report). PRGS’s FQ3 numbers were inline
w/the upside preannouncement and FQ4 was guided inline. PIR’s report was fine but the
guidance fell a bit short of expectations. Away from earnings, a group of US senators are
calling for an investigation into the recent deal struck between AGN and a Native American
tribe (http://nyti.ms/2xGRxtP). According to Bloomberg, Novartis is considering a bid for
AAAP (https://bloom.bg/2xHOjGa).
What could move the market? Expectations on key topics/events
* Taxes – now what? An update on the path forward. With the GOP tax blueprint out in the
open Congress will now get down to the hard work of filling in the details and getting a bill
to  Thy God-Emperor Trump’s desk. However, a budget resolution still needs to pass before anything can get
done on the tax front (as this will contain reconciliation instructions permitting the Senate
to utilize a simple majority vote on tax). The House should have an easier time moving a tax
bill (it probably isn’t shocking to think they could pass something by Thanksgiving) but the
Senate is a bigger problem. Sen. Hatch has made several comments on tax that people
should be paying more attention to (including that he will essentially ignore the 9/27
blueprint and write his own bill) and Sen. Corker also has expressed skepticism (he said tax
reform would make healthcare look like “a piece of cake”). It’s important to remember that
the Senate GOP majority is 1) small and 2) divided (as was evidenced by healthcare failing
twice) and one of those two descriptions will become more apt after 12/12/17 (the date of
the Alabama special Senate election). Once the Senate does move something it still has to
be reconciled w/the House and voted on all over again. Taking all this into account, it seems
like tax will be a CQ1 event at best. Beyond Mar ’18 the focus will shift towards the Nov
mid-terms and that tends to freeze the legislative process. And if there are a lot of
aggressive GOP primaries (something which could happen given Moore’s victory in
Alabama’s run-off) that could slow the legislative process even more.
* Taxes – what do investors expect? The GOP blueprint on 9/27 is being looked at as an
opening “best case” bid that will likely differ substantially from the ultimate bill (to the
extent there even is one). The final corporate rate will probably wind up being around ~25-
27% while the individual changes will focus more on the lower-end of the income spectrum
(doubling the standard deduction, higher child credit, etc.) without meaningfully adjusting
deduction rules or consolidating the existing bracket structure. “Repatriation” will happen
in some form but the mechanism proposed in the GOP blueprint is quite complex.
o Repatriation mechanics – the language in the GOP tax blueprint concerning
repatriation and foreign earnings is somewhat confusing. What it sounds like they
are proposing is: 1) all int’l earnings accumulated to this point will be hit w/a 1x
tax assessment (note – this is different from the int’l cash balances companies
report in their filings). The 1x tax rate isn’t specified but most assume it will be
somewhere around 10% and companies can pay it over the course of a few years; 2)
going forward the aim is to shift to a quasi-territorial system whereby all foreign
profits of US companies will be taxed at a reduced rate (it isn’t clear what that
reduced rate will be). It sounds like this tax will be imposed regardless of whether
the money is actually repatriated. Bottom Line: this system would be an
improvement over the current one BUT the proposed changes are very complex and
this GOP blueprint today is a lot different from the George W Bush-era 1x
repatriation holiday of last decade.
* Gov’t funding – the current CR (continuing resolution) will fund the US gov’t until 12/8.
* Debt ceiling – the debt ceiling will be suspended until 12/8 but during that time Treasury
will refresh its extraordinary measures and buy itself additional months (McConnell recently
told the NYT that the debt ceiling won’t become binding again until “well into” 2018).
o The debt ceiling –  Thy God-Emperor Trump and Schumer have apparently agreed to pursue a deal that
would permanently eliminate the debt ceiling (although it’s unclear whether this
will actually happen given the enormously busy agenda facing Washington in Dec).
* Infrastructure spending – the F18 budget may include nominal funding for an
“infrastructure bank” but no one anticipates a major infrastructure spending initiative.
* Fed staffing – it may not be until later this year before  Thy God-Emperor Trump unveils his intention for the
Fed chair. The WSJ on 9/6 said Gary Cohn’s chances of getting the job had declined while
Yellen could be asked to stay (CNN echoed that reporting on 9/7) and Bloomberg (on 9/7)
says  Thy God-Emperor Trump is considering as many as 6 additional people to become chair, including Kevin
Warsh, Glenn Hubbard, John Taylor, Lawrence Lindsey, Richard Davis, and John Allison.
Recent media reports suggest the frontrunners are Yellen and Warsh. Note that in
addition to the chair decision,  Thy God-Emperor Trump has several additional positions to fill at the Fed
(Fischer’s resignation announcement on 9/6 created the latest opening).

numbers (ISMs/PMIs, auto sales, and US jobs) but otherwise it should be pretty quiet as

AT&T — My Saving Account,25,lz7tvo,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lz7tvo/att_my_saving_account/,35,2021-03-06 23:59:59,"I posted an article on [Medium](https://olshansky.medium.com/at-t-my-saving-account-3eb035299098) a few weeks ago about how AT&T can be a ""safe"" (relatively speaking) place to park cash while you look for opportunities.  


I then had a [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/olshansky/status/1363516961473196038) with Stig Brodersen about whether it's safer/better than a general-purpose ETF.  


Given Buffet's new position in $VZ,  there might be a catalyst in the telecom industry soon, similar to how the energy sector picked up recently.  


I honestly think that the downside on $T is very low, and a much better alternative to cash given the div yield and potential (but very far from guaranteed) upside."

Both way under performing and seems the dividends would allow them to get paid while they drive stock higher just by announcing they involved.
Serious Q: Dividend monsters,21,7651a2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/7651a2/serious_q_dividend_monsters/,65,2017-10-13 19:42:38,"Real talk fam

What are some solid picks for dividend yield and perhaps also price appreciation. VZ has a solid yield but it trades in such a tight channel. Looking at F as well, but seems to have a similar pattern. 

What would be some good picks for this? Looking for my IRA, not my yolo account

Edit: thanks for the suggestions! "

Went in with the usual picks to bottom feed - GOOG, AMZN, BMY, VZ and then picked up a few others like MTDR and ET as oil was crashing. Got bored of stocks and started lurking on WSB - then ramped into ZM calls and shares as it went from the $100s to the $200s, exited too early listening to you retards here that ZM was a shitty video conferencing app, lost money on SPY puts, and then joined PRPL gang in the high teens. Rode the wave up, then down, then back up to $30+ with Jan 21 17.50c's. Yes, people made money on PRPL by not being super retarded - thanks PRPL kings. 

Now sitting on a \~$575K gain as of today (deposited another $25K later on) with the following two big YOLO positions - plan to be above $1MM by YE if the chips fall the right way:

IPOB (Opendoor) warrants: 19,500

IPOB May 21 20c: 400 contracts

OAC (For Hims) warrants: 171K

Opendoor to merge in mid December, For Hims in December or January.

They find a stock PREFERABLY ONE WITH HIGH IV and of course it should also have a SINGLE DIGIT TRADING HANDLE so they can afford to write at least one put against their precious life savings. They tell themselves OF COURSE I AM FINE WITH OWNING AAL AT 5 per share and they repeat their mantra LOOK AT HOW MUCH PREMIUM I AM GETTING FOR THE PUT EXPIRING NEXT WEEK as they sell enough so all their buying power is in use.

Then  the day comes where SPY falls to pieces after Mnuchin sneezed funny and AAL opens at 2. These born bag holders just YOLO'd their account chasing PENNIES and half of them didn't even understand what they were doing when they opened the trade.

tldr: YOLO wheeel is for the most retarded kids only, true autists are YOLOing on the other side of the trade

&#x200B;

EDIT: clarifying my point-

Here is what needs to be pointed out for the average person reading  this- if your net worth is lets say 4 figures, then when you write that  VZ put, you are putting yourself all in. You have just YOLO wheeeled  like a total retard. If you are worth say 100k, fine sell a VZ put or 2,  if you think that it is a good trade.

Some  investors are so dumb that they spend their whole lives picking up  pennies while trying to avoid the steamroller. Instead they could just  pay up and drive the steamroller (Levered long the market plus fat tail  protection).

I've  never approached trading like ""oh boy I cant wait to enter a wheel  trade"" you might as well just slap yourself and quit if thats the  mentality you bring to this game. Putting your whole account into a  wheel trade is yoloing for the most retarded of idiots who are actually  clueless about what they are doing. Putting your whole account into 1  stock would be a much better yolo but of course still dumb. True autists  yolo by going long premium.

#Trading Update

* What’s happening this morning? It was another slow evening of news other than the
German Aug factory order numbers (which were very strong although the euro and
Eurozone stocks are both in the red), a few US earnings reports (COST and YUMC), andsome M&A (GIMO, HON, JWN, PENN/PNK, SNCR, and more). The overall macro narrativeremains the same as it was at the Thurs close (see below for an update on the macro narrative as well as potential upcoming risks). The major Asian indices generally saw gains –
TPX +0.28%, NKY +0.3%, Hang Seng +0.28%, HSCEI +0.54%, Taiwan +0.14%, Australia
+1.04%, and India +0.5-7% (mainland China and Korea were both closed). There weren’t
any huge themes in Asia although Macau casino stocks were weak in HK on back of
underwhelming Golden Week visitor numbers (autos and financials led HK on the upside).
Australia’s 1% rally was led by banks, miners, and telecoms. The major Eurozone indices
are trading off small (~10-20bp); autos are outperforming while banks, retail, energy, and
utilities lag. The GBP is extending its losses from Thurs amid more uncertainty around UK
PM May (the DXY spiked ~50bp Thurs and is up small so far Fri morning). US S&P futures
are trading down 1-2 points.
* Calendar for Fri 10/6 – the focus will be on the US jobs report for Sept (8:30amET), US
wholesale inventories/trade sales for Aug (10amET), US consumer credit for Aug (3pmET),
and Fed speakers (Kaplan 8:30amET on CNBC, Bostic 9:15amET, Dudley 12:15pmET, Kaplan
12:45pmET, and Bullard 1pmET).
o US jobs preview – there is very little anticipation or focus on the Sept jobs report
(Fri morning 8/6 8:30amET) as 1) most are anticipating large storm-related
distortions and 2) at this point in the cycle it only requires ~75K monthly adds to
keep the UR steady (as was discussed in this JPMorgan report http://bit.ly/2fbT6cE).
The St is in print at +80K for adds (vs. ADP for Sept at +135K and Aug BLS +156K)
w/a 4.4% UR (unchanged w/Aug) and wages +0.3% M/M and +2.5% Y/Y (vs. Aug
+0.1% M/M and +2.5% Y/Y). It’s very difficult to see the Sept BLS report changing
the near-term US monetary policy trajectory (w/ongoing normalization and a FF
hike on 12/13). The potential for a hike on 11/1 is very low and if anything the
Sept CPI on Fri 10/13 may be a more important data point than jobs on Fri 10/6.
Instead, the bigger Fed uncertainty has nothing to do w/data or policy but instead
concerns staffing (i.e. who will be the next chair? A Trump announcement could
come as soon as next week – Powell and Warsh are the frontrunners according to
media reports w/the former appearing to have a slight edge).

#Top Headlines for Friday

* Eco data recap for Fri morning 10/6 – the big data came out of Germany where factory
orders for Aug beat expectations by a wide margin (orders +3.6% M/M vs. the St +0.7% and
+7.8% Y/Y vs. the St +4.7%). See JPMorgan’s comments on the German data
(http://bit.ly/2y42sh4). Japan’s wage inflation figures for Aug were soft, as expected
(http://bit.ly/2kuygr0).
o Fed chair – markets would be comfortable w/any of the main candidates (including
Powell, Warsh, Cohn, Yellen, etc.) w/the exception of one person: John Taylor.
Bloomberg.
o Fed update – Kansas City Fed President George spoke Thurs night and said the US
economy needed further rates hikes (http://cnb.cx/2kqTiqj). JPMorgan’s Mike
Feroli published an updated FOMC hawk/dove chart following the confirmation of
Quarles (http://bit.ly/2z1jSti).
o Japan’s “Party of Hope” unveils an economic agenda that pledges to rely less on
aggressive fiscal and monetary stimulus – Reuters http://reut.rs/2ghahXu
o AUD hit as RBA’s Harper doesn’t rule out a rate cut in a WSJ article.

* UK PM May the subject of more speculation amid disclosure of plot to topple her; former
party chairman, Grant Shapps, said May’s leadership should now be challenged. Reuters

* Spain/Catalonia – Spain’s Constitutional Court ordered the suspension of the Catalan
parliament’s regional session scheduled for Mon; Catalonia had planned on declaring
independence at the session. Reuters http://reut.rs/2xlDfjC
o Spain’s gov’t will change rules and make it easier for firms to move their legal base
out of Catalonia – Reuters http://reut.rs/2z1WQCF
* Tax update - there is a lot of focus on taxes in the US as the Senate Budget Committee
(right at the Thurs close) and the full House (at ~1pmET Thurs afternoon) advance budget
resolutions (the full Senate will presumably vote within the next two weeks). This is a
necessary step in the tax process (as these resolutions contain the reconciliation
instructions allowing tax to pass via a simple majority in the Senate) but also a relatively minor one. Far more complicated will be agreeing on rates, deduction schedules, deficits,
etc., and if anything all the press in the last few days and weeks point to divisions within
the GOP on these matters being larger than anticipated.
o Schumer warns that the proposal to eliminate the SALT deduction will kill the GOP
tax plan – Bloomberg. https://bloom.bg/2xXX8KL
o GOP desire to repeal the estate tax runs into resistance - from Republicans. As a
result this piece of the 9/27 tax blueprint (among others) may wind up being
scrapped - WSJ. http://on.wsj.com/2gf9G8E
o Fed officials express concern over tax plans – Fed officials warned the tax plan may
only provide a temporary boost to growth while fueling inflation and driving debt to
unsustainable levels – Reuters http://reut.rs/2xWMrdG
* Republican headaches keep growing as donors withhold money, a tax consensus fails to
materialize, and “establishment” figures depart the scene (Strange losing to Moore, Corker
retiring, etc.). Republican leaders are increasingly concerned about the party’s grip on the
House and Senate should it fail to pass a tax bill. Leaders “fear that the inchoate populism
that Mr. Trump personifies, and which Mr. Bannon is attempting to weaponize against
incumbents, is on the march” – NYT http://nyti.ms/2y3lUKT
* Trump looks to jolt NAFTA – the White House is considering a proposal that would
represent a radical shift to the principles underlying NAFTA. According to rule changes
being considered, automobiles would need to have a specific level of US-made content in
order to qualify for tariff breaks (right now autos only need to have a specific level of
content from within the NAFTA region). WSJ. http://on.wsj.com/2y4LXlo
* Trump makes cryptic comment ahead of a dinner with US military leaders. Trump said the
dinner might represent “the calm before the storm”. Asked repeatedly by reporters to
clarify his comments, Trump said, “You’ll find out” – Bloomberg https://bloom.bg/2xXI2r6
* Trump was “furious” over NBC’s Tillerson “moron” article; John Kelly was forced to
rearrange his schedule and stayed in Washington in order to try and calm tensions – NBC.
http://nbcnews.to/2fOGx3B
* Iran/Trump – Trump will “decertify” the Iran nuclear accord next week (speech on 10/12)
and declare the agreement as not being in the US national interest according to the
Washington Post (article out at ~2:40pmET Thurs afternoon). This is consistent w/what the
AP and Politico reported earlier in the week. Note that Trump’s 10/12 declarations won’t
end the Iranian nuclear pact as it will be up to Congress whether re-impose sanctions on
Tehran (and Trump will hold off on recommending such a step). Washington Post

o The WSJ notes that a key European junk-bond index is now yielding less than 10yr
US TSYs although it offers a reasonable explanation for this ostensibly irrational
price level – WSJ. http://on.wsj.com/2xkwYVb
* Company-specific news update from Thurs night. There were a few earnings reports out
Thurs AMC but for the most part it was another slow evening. COST EPS beats thanks to
better SG&A and favorable tax while GMs were light; Sept same-store-sales beat w/upside
in the US (the stock ended down 3% during the Thurs after-hours trading session). YUMC’s
results came in ahead of expectations (EPS/same-store-sales) and it increased capital return.
SNCR reentered M&A talks w/Siris Capital (Siris is looking to buy SNCR’s Intralinks and may
take a ~20% equity stake in SNCR); SNCR ended up ~27% during the Thurs after-hours
trading session. According to the WSJ, HON is pursuing an acquisition of Evoqua Water Tech
in a deal that could be worth $3B (http://on.wsj.com/2yseCSp). The WSJ reported (during
trading on Thurs http://on.wsj.com/2xjE24p) on merger talks between PENN and PNK (the
firms have been unable to agree to terms but PENN is still interested in buying PNK).
* JWN buyout not completely dead – the Nordstrom family is exploring a new deal structure
w/Leonard Green that would involve less debt. The family is trying to raise more equity
(although it isn’t clear where the money will come from). WSJ. http://on.wsj.com/2ggTvbh
* GIMO – Elliot’s takeover talks w/the company have ground to a halt according to Reuters
over price disagreements – Reuters http://reut.rs/2fNCepo

Grove-CRH PLC transaction. Ash Grove’s board said the offer could result in a superior
proposal and that it would engage in talks with the third party. Bloomberg.

expectations – Bloomberg https://bloom.bg/2fOuGmd

#Identifying risks – what could go wrong?

* Reflation enthusiasm is undercut by less aggressive CB normalization, dramatic curve
flattening, and/or a softening in nominal growth. Of all the reflation pieces (monetary policy
normalization, expansionary fiscal policy, firming inflation, and ongoing real growth
strength), the last piece (real growth) is increasingly being taken for granted.
* Bank investors wind up focusing too much on reflation/yields (which are tailwinds) but miss
weakening credit (higher provisions) and tepid loan growth.
* The first speech by the next Fed chair unsettles sentiment (assuming the chair isn’t Yellen).
* The tax process slows in Washington as Republicans prove incapable of reaching a
consensus on rates, deductions, and deficits.
* Paul Ryan decides to “pull a Boehner”, stepping down as Speaker out of frustration with his
inability to pass legislation.
* The final tax bill results in materially higher rates for upper-income Americans.
* May winds up stepping down as UK PM, sowing ongoing Brexit uncertainty.
* Abe does much worse than anticipated during the upcoming Japan election (10/22).
* North Korea conducts an above-ground nuclear bomb test (or even worse, an atmospheric
test).
* Iran decides to resume its nuclear weapons program, sparking an immediate escalation of
Middle East geopolitical tensions (Trump’s Iran speech is coming up on 10/12).
* Washington introduces (or threatens to introduce) tough new regulations aimed at
internet/social media companies following the Russia election investigations (note that US
internet giants will be testifying before Congress on 11/1).
* Prominent members of the Trump team decide to leave the gov’t (the market would be
particularly sensitive to Tillerson, Mattis, Kelly, and/or Cohn departing; recent media reports
suggest the Tillerson-Trump relationship is particularly strained).

#Macro Update

* The pro-reflation bias commenced back on 9/11 and has been propelled ever since by
ongoing real growth strength, firming inflation, normalizing monetary policy/rhetoric, and
expansionary fiscal policy (in particular in the US w/the 9/27 tax blueprint but also in
Germany following that country’s election outcome and fin min change).
* This enthusiasm can extend for a few more weeks but the ECB/BOE decisions (on 10/26
and 11/2, respectively) will mark the culmination of a series of pro-reflation
catalysts/developments and thus the trade may enter a period of extended consolidation
around those central bank events.
* Meanwhile the nuances of this present reflation process aren’t being appreciated –
growth and corporate earnings are late-cycle (not early), multiples are already rich
(although not necessarily ridiculous), inflation is only very gradually firming to target, the
economy faces enormous structural headwinds in the form of labor supply and productivity
growth, and while central banks are normalizing policy will stay extremely accommodative
for years to come (the structural headwinds and slow tightening pace will prevent yields
from materially rising and curves from significantly steepening).
* The tenor of sentiment is beginning to evolve and there is definitely greater frustration
w/people being forced to participate in a tape many don’t particularly love at present
levels – this helps fuel runs such has occurred over the last few weeks (the SPX hasn’t closed
in the red since Mon 9/25) but it also makes for a precarious setup w/a lot of weak
“renters” who will be quick to sell the minute momentum pauses.
* Bottom Line: the lack of major catalysts is helping the rally propagate and the calendar is
relatively clear until earnings (which kick off w/banks on Thurs 10/12). The reflation
impetus will likely stay in place into the ECB/BOE (10/26 and 11/2, respectively) after which
a consolidation (at least) is likely (note that a lot of the “easy” tax steps are occurring now
– the blueprint on 9/27, the budget resolutions, etc. However, reaching a consensus on
rates, deductions, and deficits will be extremely difficult and this will become more
apparent later in Oct and into Nov, around the same time as the ECB/BOE decisions).

#Calendar of events to watch for the week of Mon Oct 9

* Calendar for the week of 10/9 – overall it should be a relatively slow week although a few
items are in focus. The current reflation emphasis makes the US CPI on Fri 10/13 prob. the
single most important eco data point of the week but there are other numbers in focus
(German trade/IP for Aug and China imports/exports for Sept). The CQ3 earnings season
kicks off in earnest with the banks on Thurs and Friday. Away from scheduled events, media
reports suggest Catalonia could formally declare independence on Mon (although this could
easily be delayed following court challenges and as the region’s leaders seek a settlement
w/Madrid) while the White House may unveil its infrastructure spending blueprint during
the week of 10/9 (http://bit.ly/2wwiop9). South Korean security officials have warned that
North Korea may fire additional missiles between 10/10 and 10/18 while Trump’s Fed chair
selection could come soon (media reports suggest Powell and Warsh are the two
frontrunners). Trump is expected to deliver an Iranian policy speech on/around Thurs
10/12 during which he will declare the nuclear deal as no longer being in the US national
interest. HON has said it will announce its formal portfolio review decision prior to earnings
(media reports, including on CNBC, suggest it will retain its aerospace unit).
* Calendar for Mon 10/9 – the day should be pretty quiet owing to the US Columbus Day
holiday (equities will be open but fixed income is closed). The focus will be on the China FX
reserve numbers for Sept (Fri night/Sat morning 10/7), the China Caixin services PMI for
Sept (Sun night/Mon morning), Germany’s industrial production for Aug (2amET), and
earnings (LVMH reports results after the European close).
* Calendar for Tues 10/10 – the focus will be on the German trade figures for Aug (2amET), a
bunch of analyst meetings (including TECD, Santander, WDAY, and WMT), the PG
shareholder meeting (at which the Trian/Peltz board seat request will be voted on), and
earnings (CUDA after the close).
* Calendar for Wed 10/11 – the focus will be on the US JOLTs report for Aug (10amET), Fed
minutes from the 9/20 meeting (2pmET), analyst meetings (KR), and earnings (DAL, BLK,
FAST, and OZRK before the open).
 
* Calendar for Thurs 10/12 – the focus will be on Eurozone IP for Aug (5amET), the US PPI for
Sept (8:30amET), Trump’s Iran speech, analyst meetings (BOX, HPQ, LSCC, and WDC), and
earnings (C, DPZ, JPM, LNN, Sky PLC, and Tata Consultancy pre-open).
* Calendar for Fri 10/13 – the focus will be on China’s imports/exports for Sept (Thurs
night/Fri morning), the US CPI for Sept (8:30amET), US retail sales for Sept (8:30amET), the
Michigan Confidence numbers for Oct (10amET), US business inventories for Aug (10amET),
analyst meetings (SAFM), and earnings (BAC, DRFG, FHN, FRC, JBHT, Man Group, PNC, and
WFC pre-open).

#Trading Update

• Market update – from the perspective of US equities, it was a quiet weekend and US S&P
futures are about flat as a result (Eurozone stocks are off ~40-50bp and Asia ended mixed).
Eco data was solid out of Germany and Taiwan but none of those numbers are altering the
domestic narrative (the China Dec FX reserve figures were about inline). On the political
front GOP support for the “repeal-without-replace” ACA strategy appears to be waning
(which is likely neutral for the S&P although could be an indirect positive to the extent it
preserves political capital for Trump to expend elsewhere such as on tax reform).

• Calendar – the focus for Mon 1/9 will be on US consumer credit for Nov (3pmET), a few Fed
speakers (Rosengren and Lockhart), some earnings (AYI, CMC, GPN pre-open and APOL,
CUDA, and WDFC after the close), and conferences (ICR and JPM Healthcare).

• Eurozone stocks – the main Eurozone indices are off ~40-50bp. Chemicals, banks,
insurance, media, real estate, healthcare, telecoms, and energy are all lagging while autos,
basic resources, and tech are outperforming.

• FX – the DXY rebounded Fri and that strength is persisting into Mon (the DXY is up ~20bp).
The USD is up a lot vs. the GBP (the GBP is down ~100bp) following remarks from PM May
over the weekend. The CNY/CNH both saw weakness Mon following the China FX data out
over the weekend.

• Treasuries – 2yr yields are flattish while 10 and 30yr yields are down ~2 and 3bp.

• Asia – trading was relatively quiet in Asia w/Japan closed for a holiday. The other markets
were mixed: Hong Kong (Hang Seng +0.25%, HSCEI -0.09%), mainland China (SHCOMP
+0.54%, Shenzhen +0.3%, CSI 300 +0.48%), Taiwan (TAIEX -0.32%), Korea (KOSPI -0.02%),
Australia (ASX 200 +0.9%), and India (down ~10bp for the major indices). There wasn’t a lot
of major Asia-specific news other than the China Dec FX reserve figures (about inline) and
the Taiwan trade figures (which hit after the close and were solid).

• Hong Kong - Macau was the clear outperformer +2.9% while Cement -0.55% and Coal -0.4%
lagged. COLI +1.4% moved higher after its project Kai Tak No.1 (II) received ~1,500
reservations for 125 units available, 11x oversubscribed. HK property names remained well
bid despite the recent 6-7% rally on demand recovery, technical breakout and improving
funding, CKP +0.71% SHK +0.6%. Large dispersion amongst Energy names with Petrochina
making new high +2.3% while CNOOC declined 0.9%. China gas names were well bid after
media reported Air Products has placed a bid to acquire Yindge Gases, all large caps reacted
positively ENN Energy +4.15% China Res Gas +6.2% China Gas Holdings +5.26%. Macau
names put on strong performances driven by external broker comments and ahead of
positive seasonality (Chinese New Year), Sands +2.67% Wynn +3% Galaxy +4.26%. In the
financials, we saw some risk-off with all Chinese Insurers offered China Life -0.5% CPIC -
0.54%; at the same time AIA +1.23% outperformed mainly driven by its defensive feature.
Autos were very active with Geely +3.8% announcing a profit warning (more than double
the earnings in FY17) and GWM +1.24% announcing a target of 1.25m units for FY17.

• South Korea – Samsung Electronics extended its gains from last week following the Thurs
night upside earnings report (up another 2.82%) while Hynix did very well too (up 3.23%).
This was offset by weakness elsewhere – NAVER -2.5%, KEP -2.27%, POSCO -2.4%,
AMOREPACIFIC -4%, etc.

• Taiwan – the TAIEX ended down 0.32%. A lot of the large-cap tech names finished in the
red (Largan -3.26%, Hon Hai -0.36%, MediaTek -1.36%, Novatek -2.73%, etc) although there
were some pockets of green (Quanta +1.99%, Inventec +4.46%, AUO +2.39%, Foxconn
+0.71%). TSMC ended flat ahead of its earnings later this week.

#Top Headlines for Monday

• German eco numbers come in solid – Nov IP came in +2.2% Y/Y (vs. the St +1.9%), exports
+3.9% (vs. the St +0.5%), and imports +3.5% (vs. the St +1.1%). See JPMorgan takeaways:
http://bit.ly/2i7MJm7

• German politics – the SPD, Linke, and Green parties in Germany have outlined the
conditions by which they would form a coalition. The parties in aggregate have more seats
than Merkel’s coalition and thus their alignment could result in a new chancellor for the
country. However, the SPD and Linke have in the past differed materially on certain policies
(which could complicate any attempt to combine in a coalition). Reuters.
http://reut.rs/2jshXJC

• Brexit negotiations – PM May said the UK would make a definitive break w/the EU but
wants to negotiate the best possible trade deal w/the bloc – WSJ
http://on.wsj.com/2iTQOfE


• Taiwan – trade numbers for Dec come in strong (exports +14% vs. the St +10.4% and
imports +13.2% vs. the St +10%). Bloomberg.

• Trump/cabinet – Trump’s management policy in the WH will represent a sharp break from
the Obama era. According to Politico, Trump plans on giving his cabinet secretaries and top
aids sig. latitude to run their agencies. Trump also is encouraging his secretaries to “make a
splash” within the first six months of his presidency – Politico http://politi.co/2iUOOWE

• Trump/Sessions/immigration – the Washington Post discusses how the Trump team could
wind up imposing significant restrictions on the H-1B visa program. Trump and Sessions
want to materially overhaul the program and could even scrap it all together. Washington
Post http://wapo.st/2i9sCXY

• Corporate tax reform – Larry Summers criticizes the Ryan/Trump corporate tax proposal in
a Washington Post editorial; while tax reform is crucial, Summers thinks there is a better
way (Summers sees four problems w/the Ryan/Trump blueprint – it increases inequality,
harms certain American business sectors, could spark protectionist measures from other
countries, and would threaten entitlements by eroding the tax base) – Washington Post
http://wapo.st/2i5pv53

• Fiat Chrysler – the co said it would invest an extra $1B in the US, creating 2K new jobs in the
process – FT http://on.ft.com/2iSKwie (the WSJ discusses how auto makers are
increasingly in the “hot seat” as Trump pressures the industry over production plans
http://on.wsj.com/2iYRkLZ).

• Dialog Semi has pre-announced preliminary 4Q16 sales of $365m (+5.6% QoQ, -8% YoY),
broadly in line with Bloomberg consensus. The underlying cash generation was modestly
higher than our estimate. Company hasn't given any commentary on 1Q17 and FY17 –
Udeshi http://bit.ly/2iUyF3x

#Top Headlines from the Weekend

• Trump facing economic headwinds and tax doubts – Politico discusses that while US
growth remains decent, trends are quietly slowing and in contrast to Obama in ’09 Trump
today is inheriting an economy resting on relatively solid foundations and at/near fullemployment
(thus while Obama’s record benefited from easy economic comparisons,
Trump’s will suffer from the opposite set of conditions). Meanwhile, further Fed tightening
will act as a headwind while investors are growing increasingly nervous about the fallout
from the GOP tax reform proposal. Politico. http://politi.co/2j2a0aM

• Growth/inflation risks skewed to the upside – the latest JPMorgan Global Data Watch
(from Bruce Kasman) discusses how upside risks are building to the growth and inflation
forecasts. The clearest case for a positive GDP growth surprise is in the manufacturing
sector. The improvement in manufacturing aligns with better news on global consumption
and our global services activity PMI, building the case for stronger global GDP growth. A
surge in animal spirits could turn the tide in the direction of sustained stronger growth.
Upside risks to inflation complement upside growth risks. The global economy isn’t without
obstacles – we are mindful of headwinds to EM growth and remain skeptical that US fiscal
policy will turn materially stimulative. http://bit.ly/2irBCVX

• Tax reforms – the NYT looks at the House GOP corporate tax reform plan. Over time the
proposal could have virtuous effects on the US economy by encouraging more domestic
production and employment while reducing the reliance on debt. However, those benefits
would only accrue over the long-term while implementation of the GOP blueprint (which
the NYT calls the most revolutionary overhaul in the history of the corporate tax code) could
create enormous disruptions almost immediately (harming sectors particularly dependent
on imports like retail while strengthening the dollar to such an extent it impacts EMs and
others). NYT http://nyti.ms/2jhceCx

• Retailers face multibillion dollar tax hit under GOP plan – the WSJ discusses how the
border tax adjustments in the GOP plan threatens to cost the retail industry billions – WSJ
http://on.wsj.com/2iP0s3k

• Border taxes – the WSJ notes that the border tax proposal has the support of House
Republican leadership but Senators and Trump have yet to definitively weigh in on the
subject – WSJ http://on.wsj.com/2iP0s3k

• Taxes - Larry Kudlow on CNBC (Fri afternoon at ~3:40pmET) says he is ""worried"" that
markets are too upbeat around tax reform; tax reform details won't be known until the end
of this year at the earliest and Kudlow thinks there is the risk that companies defer
economic activity in anticipation of this legislation.

• Healthcare – ACA repeal at risk as four Republicans in the Senate express doubt – the
Washington Post notes that four GOP senators have expressed doubt over the ACA repeal
strategy which means the party may not have enough votes even for the reconciliation
process. Washington Post http://wapo.st/2jmX8zi (the WSJ http://on.wsj.com/2inrRIv,
The Hill http://bit.ly/2jeSdfA, and Politico http://politi.co/2jmYudr also highlight rising GOP
opposition both in the House and Senate to the ACA repeal-without-replace strategy).

• Healthcare – Republicans grapple w/ACA taxes. The GOP is trying to figure out whether to
scrap the ACA taxes during the repeal process or leave them in place. Removing the taxes
would add to the deficit and make it harder to pay for a replacement – WSJ
http://on.wsj.com/2i1B9J0

• Obama thinks ObamaCare will survive – Obama thinks his signature healthcare law will
remain intact (although it could get a new name). ""It may be called something else. And as
I said, I don't mind. If in fact the Republicans make some modifications, some of which I may
have been seeking previously, but they wouldn't cooperate because they didn't want to --
make the system work, and relabel it as Trumpcare, I'm fine with that” – ABC
http://abcn.ws/2i3b1CH

• Entitlement reform – Trump doesn’t want to “meddle” with Medicare or Social Security
according to The Hill. Reince Priebus spoke over the weekend and said Trump intends on
honoring his campaign pledge when it comes to entitlements (he won’t pursue entitlement
reform). Priebus said Trump plans to “shore up” Medicare and Social Security for future
generations by achieving 3-6% economic growth – The Hill http://bit.ly/2iRJCTr

• China Dec FX reserve data (numbers out Sat morning 1/7) – takeaways from JPMorgan’s
Grace Ng - China’s FX reserves fell by $41.1 billion in December and registered $3.01 trillion
(J.P. Morgan: 3.025 trillion; consensus: $3.01 trillion). This is the lowest level since March
2011, and compared to the peak of $3.993 trillion in June 2014. We estimate that capital
outflows in December were around $55 billion. http://bit.ly/2irrqwK

• China – the country’s Vice Finance Minister said he was confident China’s economy grew
6.7% last year. Growth expanded at a 6.7% pace in Q1-3 and Q4 is expected to have been
at or above that level – Reuters http://reut.rs/2i2v8AQ

• EU breakup risk – German Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel warned that political support for
the EU is at its lowest point ever and a break-up of the union is no longer inconceivable. ""I
once asked the chancellor, what would be more costly for Germany: for France to be
allowed to have half a percentage point more deficit, or for Marine Le Pen to become
president?” – Reuters http://reut.rs/2iRs1sP

• Russia/US – Reince Priebus said Trump accepts the findings of the US intelligence
community regarding Russia’s involvement in the US election and the President Elect may
take actions in response once he enters office – Reuters http://reut.rs/2jhEc0P

• US/NATO – the US military has vowed to conduct additional training exercises in Europe
and bolster NATO further in a bit to deter Russian aggression. ""Let me be clear: This is one
part of our efforts to deter Russian aggression, ensure the territorial integrity of our allies
and maintain a Europe that is whole, free, prosperous, and at peace” – Reuters
http://reut.rs/2iWF26E

• Fund flows – update from JPMorgan’s Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou - inflows to favor equities in
’17 - Q4 equity funds flows increased to close to $90bn worldwide on our estimates, while
bond fund flows decreased to $40bn. Extrapolating these Q4 flows into this year
mechanically implies equity fund flows of close to $400bn for 2017 and bond fund flows of
less than $200bn. http://bit.ly/2iRoVqz

• Semiconductor M&A – the White House reiterated its desire to protect American
semiconductor IP from foreign buyers amid Chinese goals of dominating the industry;
restrictions around investments by Chinese entities in the US semi industry are likely to rise–
WSJ http://on.wsj.com/2iMsxIB

• North Korea – NK on Sun said it could test an ICBM at any time and from any location.
""The ICBM will be launched anytime and anywhere determined by the supreme
headquarters of the DPRK” – Reuters http://reut.rs/2irDT3D

• North Korea – US Def. Sec threatens to shoot down NK ICBM test - Defense Secretary Ash
Carter called NK’s nuclear and missile programs a “serious threat” and threatened to shoot
down any North Korean ICBM test ""if it were coming towards our territory or the territory of
our friends and allies” – Reuters http://reut.rs/2i5zdj2

• Nigeria – the Niger Delta Avengers are preparing to resume attacks against facilities as
peace talks w/the gov’t begin to break down – Reuters http://reut.rs/2j22koL

#Macro Update
• US macro update - sentiment remains quite effusive looking out over the course of the year
although there is nervousness about a near-term digestion pullback (that could coincide
w/the inauguration on Fri 1/20). The large gap between political expectations and reality is
the single biggest cloud hanging over equities but the problem with allowing that chasm to
inform an overly negative view is: 1) growth (the nominal growth improvement predates
11/8 by several months and remains in place) and 2) timing (markets appreciate that any
Trump-linked change won’t be immediate and thus appear willing to give him the benefit of
the doubt potentially into the end of the summer).

#Calendar of events to watch for the week of Mon Jan 9
• US speakers – the week of Mon 1/9 has a big lineup of speakers w/Obama’s farewell
address on Tues 1/10, Trump’s press conf. on Wed 1/11 (11amET), and a Yellen speech
Thurs night 1/12 7pmET). Trump on Wed will be the most important assuming he holds a
true Q&A-format press conf. and fields questions from a variety of reporters (he hasn’t done
this in several months) – this would help shed light on a variety of topics including ACA
repeal/replace, deregulation, tax reform, etc. Yellen’s speech Wed night (7pmET) isn’t likely
to be a major catalyst.

• Trump catalysts for the week of 1/9 – a lot of events coming up w/a slew of confirmation
hearings and Trump’s press conf. Sessions (AG) confirmation hearing Jan 10-11, Tillerson
(State) confirmation hearing Jan 11, Pompeo (CIA) confirmation hearing Jan 11, DeVos
(Education) confirmation hearing Jan 11, Kelly (Homeland Sec) confirmation hearing Jan 11,
Chao (Transportation) confirmation hearing Jan 11, Ross (Commerce) confirmation hearing
Jan 12, Carson (HUD) confirmation hearing Jan 12, and Puzder (Labor) confirmation hearing
Jan 12. More confirmation hearings will be added to the calendar (Price at HHS and
Mnuchin at Treasury will be important). In terms of market-moving news, the ones to
watch are Tillerson, Ross, and Puzder; Carson could be interesting but only for FNMA/FMCC
(technically he will be in charge of both companies). These articles provide some more
details (Washington Post http://wapo.st/2hYBgKd and Politico http://politi.co/2ikW4rx). In
addition to all these hearings, Trump’s press conf. is scheduled for Wed 1/11 at 11amET.

• China economic numbers – Dec CPI/PPI (Tues morning 1/10), Dec imports/exports (Fri
morning 1/13), and Dec IP/retail sales/FAI and Q4 GDP (Fri morning 1/20).

• US eco data – the eco calendar is relatively sparse in the US during the week of 1/9 although
a few figures on Fri 1/13 will be in focus (Dec PPI, Dec retail sales, and Jan Michigan
Confidence).

• Bank earnings – the CQ4 bank earnings season kicks off Fri morning 1/13 (BAC, BLK, FHN,
FRC, JPM, PNC, and WFC will all post results that morning). The Q4 numbers will prob. be
somewhat of an afterthought with investors much more focused on mgmt.’s guidance
commentary (impact from higher rates, deregulation, etc.). Also, any deleterious effects of
higher rates will be watched closely too (including any softening in loan demand, esp.
mortgages, credit deterioration, etc.).

"Look, forget your TA, fundamentals ultimately matter in this Environmnet",3,wjy0aa,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wjy0aa/look_forget_your_ta_fundamentals_ultimately/,14,2022-08-09 14:06:56,"Boys, 

I know why you're bullish. Bears are repeating what they've heard from their favorite Tiktok analyst about QE, how our economy can't handle 3%+, etc. When the shoe shine boy says the doom is here, inverse that fucker. But look, I looked. I looked at Alphabet, Meta, Amazon, Nvidia, and your mom. I've got mom fetishes like I got 10-Q fetishes, and the generals--the kings of the Nasdaq? They're getting old. They had their best years. What do you think covid represented? The peak of technology. You think it gets better from here? AWS gonna keep breaking records? Think advertsing in Google and Meta are going to go up when we have TikTok, the new advertising king? If your dumbass company hasn't already switched its marketing budgeting and accruals to tiktok spend, your company is lagging. Only boomers use facebook now. Google hasn't done anything innovated in 10 years. AND **TSLA??????** REALLY???????? Do you know Elon just bought the idea from the real innovate guys from his  Paypal equity? That doesn't really matter, but look. I learned literally probably five important things pursuing a useless ass Economics degree. One of those is that **CAPITAL INTENSIVE COMPANIES ARE LITERALLY THE WORST COMPANIES TO INVEST IN. The one thing that separates TSLA from its competitors is not its innovation-- fucking everyone's got the same shit as them.** ***Elon has been promising FSD tech for a 2.625 years. He's been telling you lies and financing everything from equity investment.. Why raise capital through debt, when there's a limited liability through equity financing? But in the end,*** **Man's been overpromising and undelivering. Always, and forever. Someone once told me ""the chicken comes home to roost."" He was talking about CMG when I told him it was a good investment after its salmonella poisoning, so he was wrong. But that quote has stuck with me. Elon isn't really Steve Jobs, its all a façade. He's a fraud, whose been able to get away with it because he figured out equity financing is always better than debt financing. What a fucking genius. If you rely on equity financing you don't have any real liabilities. You just need to convince people you're fucking reputable. Man's worth 222+ billion now, so it's more likely I die before my man Elon gets exposed. But fuck em. I'll tell you something. Elon's company, just like AAPL, just like NVDA, AMD, AMZN, etc., -- we're fucking fucked. Why? The dream is never as good as reality.** 

&#x200B;

Enough yelling. Let me tell you something about human nature. **We count our chickens before they roost; we rest on our laurels.** God damn you see you that ring true in America. Fucking  Fucking Americans have so much security BEING American. We have Americans claiming they're so damn good when Elon has skewed average income to levels average persons never reached. We got bulls celebrating commodities peaking from UNSUSTANAIBLE LEVELS. Man, chill, that's the 1% carrying our relatively average country. **American Exceptionalism, ""but that's another topic"" - drake. You think you're really something special? Only a few really do anything imaginative.**  I'm tryna tell you guys, we're built on a house of cards. Most money is allocated in the aforementioned companies( 401k's passive investing) ...The USDhas been rising when only about 40% of the big companies receive their revenue in foreign currency, before needing to exchange to strong USD (NEGATIVE BTW) . **Negative because our revenue and bottom line is negatively impacted by foreign exchange impact (you'll hear this a lot moving forward in earnings calls when google, msft miss).**

&#x200B;

**I've been thinking about this for awhile, done the fucking numbers and will go out on a limb now that we're in this short squeeze rally. Google, MSFT, AMZN, CMG, KO, AND (POSSIBLY) APPLE, WILL NEVER GENERATE THE FCF, OPERATING INCOME, EARNINGS, etc. -- PER SHARE, THAT WE EXPECT. They will trade like BUD, MO, T. VZ, BA, etc in the future. Looks like a general market squeeze going on right now because the shoe shine boy is hollering dooom and gloom, but soon, he'll sing song of good times when the market goes green as it has. That is the time, from now to about 13.8k on Nasdaq, 430 on SPY, when the squeeze has squoze and you'll see. You'll see the chicken come home to roost. All the liquidity be sucked up, fed fund at 125 bps higher than today, and maturities of bonds without reinvestment**

&#x200B;

 **You'll see, and it'll probably be after you do anything about it.**

&#x200B;

**Wish you all the best, but only a few end up with the bread in the end.**

Basically take a bunch of top brands like 50 of them. Run through dual momentum timing model, with only one asset to hold at a time with a 12 month look back period. 

Backtested from 2006, gives 37.5% return to date with a maximum drawdown of -55% during the GFC. 

You can update the stocks to run with latest names like ROKU, SHOP, SQ, etc. So far in 2019, with those stocks in, its returned 92.75% with a maximum drawdown of -2%. Sharpe ratio 3 in 2019.

Verizon refuses to admit that its “first to 5G” commercials are misleading - Any insights on 5G?,19,b5sntr,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b5sntr/verizon_refuses_to_admit_that_its_first_to_5g/,44,2019-03-26 23:06:28," [https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/03/verizon-refuses-to-admit-that-its-first-to-5g-commercials-are-misleading/](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/03/verizon-refuses-to-admit-that-its-first-to-5g-commercials-are-misleading/) 

I've currently got proper allocation in terms of satisfying my autism with options and growth stocks. I want to move towards value stocks with high dividends for boring compounding interest tendies so I can safely reinvest them into FDs. 

I personally believe that 5G is the future and stocks like VZ and T are a nice long term play considering their high dividends. Frankly, I do not know much about the intricacies of the science/technology behind 5G and which stocks I should be looking at. VZ is pushing that they are first movers in 5G, but it looks like that may not be the case. Any insight is appreciated. "

#Trading Update

*  What’s happening this morning? There were a bunch of headlines but the broader US
narrative isn’t changing dramatically (US S&P futures are flat-to-up 1 point). The main eco
highlight this morning was the China Sept inflation numbers (CPI was inline while PPI
firmed by more than expected). Recall it was the China Aug inflation numbers back on 9/11
that kicked off the recent reflation trade. Central bank messaging was very mixed over the
weekend as a slew of officials spoke on the sidelines of the IMF/World Bank meetings; the
coming meetings are likely to bring tightening rhetoric/actions (ECB tapering guidance
10/26, BOE hike 11/2, FOMC hike 12/13) but officials remain concerned about the state of
global inflation (and Draghi emphasized on more than one occasion how ECB ZIRP would
likely stay in place for some time after the end of the LSAP). A Bloomberg article this
morning talks about how the ECB may run out of QE capacity soon (the limit may be EU2.5T
but the ECB will have bought EU2.3T by the end of this year). On the political front, US Sen.
Susan Collins said she would likely vote “yes” on this week’s budget resolution (passage is
necessary for tax but this is a relatively minor step in the overall process), the Catalonia
situation remains unresolved as the region failed to clarify whether it intended to declare
independence (it faces a new deadline this Thurs morning), tensions flared in Iraq as gov’t
forces moved to recapture Kurdish-held oil fields and a military base near Kirkuk (this news
has oil up ~1% this morning), and polls in Japan point to a strong victory for Abe’s coalition
(the election is Sun 10/22). Stocks in Asia generally did well – TPX +0.62%, NKY +0.47%,
Hang Seng +0.76%, HSCEI +0.72%, SHCOMP -0.36%, Taiwan +0.47%, Korea +0.26%,
Australia +0.56%, and India up ~60bp. Tech stocks in Korea continued to bleed lower
(Hynix -2.2%, Samsung Electronics -0.15%) while they generally saw gains in Taiwan (Largan
+4.05%, Hon Hai +1.4%, Quanta +7%, TSMC +0.21%, etc.). Europe’s major indices are flatto-
up small; basic resources are the big upside standout (SXPP +1.6% - it was bolstered Fri
on the China import numbers and the PPI figure out of the country is helping this morning)
while chemicals, media, healthcare, and energy are all doing well too; industrials, staples,
tech, and utilities are small laggards. Convatec Group PLC is down ~20% after issuing a
profit warning and Kuehne + Nagel is weak on earnings.
o Tactically fade reflation as narrative begins fraying at the margin; 2-10 TSY spread
just a few BPs from hitting 52w tights – the reflation narrative has enjoyed several
weeks of uninterruptedly favorable news, including firming inflation, solid real
growth, expansionary fiscal policy announcements, and hawkish CB
rhetoric/decisions. However, the news is beginning to turn more neutral at the
margin and this could cause pro-reflation themes to consolidate (at least).
*  Calendar of events for the week of Mon 10/16 – the main focus this week will be on
earnings, China, and US taxes. The China National Congress kicks off Wed 10/18 and the
country will be publishing a lot of eco data (inflation out Mon morning 10/16 and Q3 GDP
along w/Sept retail sales/IP/FAI out Thurs morning 10/19). Investors will keep an eye on
North Korea as media reports suggest the country could fire off some missiles around the
China Congress. In the US investors will be digesting earnings (the week of 10/16 is the first
busy one of the CQ3 season) and macro news should be limited aside from some Fed
speakers (including Yellen who speaks Fri 10/20 after the close). The US tax process will
continue w/the Senate voting on a budget resolution (likely Thurs 10/19) - passage is
expected but the final vote will likely be close; Rand Paul seems a hard “no” while McCain
and a few others are question marks; investors will be watching to see if any Democrats
cross the aisle. Keep in mind that the Senate budget resolution will need to be reconciled
w/the one from the House. Finally, the EU Leaders Summit runs 10/19-20 and the Japanese
snap election takes place Sun 10/22.
*  Calendar for Mon 10/16 – the focus will be on earnings (SCHW pre-open and BRO, CE, IEX,
NAVI, NFLX, Rio Tinto, RT, and SONC after the close).

#Top Headlines for Monday

*  Economic data/monetary policy recap for Mon 10/16 – the main highlight this morning
were China inflation numbers and the figures were generally solid (http://bit.ly/2yk55wf).
CPI for Sept was largely inline (+1.6%) while PPI firmed by more than anticipated (+6.9% vs.
JPM +6.3% and vs. the St +6.4%).
o Central bank leadership uncertainty – Reuters discusses how the world’s major
central banks may all see leadership changes over the next 1-2 years. The Fed,
BOJ, and PBOC may all have new leaders in early ’18 while Draghi is due to depart
the scene the following year. Reuters http://reut.rs/2yqVWkJ
o Central bankers adopt dovish tone regarding policy at weekend IMF/World Bank
meetings given tepid inflation trends – “central bankers cling to stimulus amid
weak inflation” – WSJ http://on.wsj.com/2gIt6TW
o Rosengren said in an interview Friday that a Fed rate hike in Dec remained likely.
“A failure to tighten would risk both the labor market and financial prices getting
into an area where we would have to react more quickly, and that would increase
the probability that we end up having a recession” (WSJ
http://on.wsj.com/2ieTh88); Rosengren added that he anticipates 3-4 hikes next
year (Reuters http://reut.rs/2xIze41).
o ECB running out of QE capacity – total ECB bond purchases will hit EU2.28T by the
end of ’17 and some within the central bank think the ultimate limit is only EU2.5T
(meaning it may only be able to purchase an additional ~EU200B worth of bonds in
2018) – Bloomberg. https://bloom.bg/2xIiBFP
o China’s central bank governor said growth in the country could accelerate slightly
to +7% in H2 – Reuters http://bit.ly/2xIsRTa
*  US taxes – while Republican deficit hawks aren’t nearly as assertive as they once were,
disagreements over the fiscal implications of the GOP’s tax plan risk imploding the entire
initiative. Politico http://politi.co/2idPsjK
*  US taxes – mortgage interest deduction to stay but become worthless? The GOP blueprint
would double the standard deduction for individuals and couples, making the mortgage
interest deduction worthless for anyone who doesn’t itemize. WSJ
http://on.wsj.com/2ieCnGC
*  Thy God Emperor Trump privately predicts he will appoint four Supreme Court justices by the end of his first
term – Axios http://bit.ly/2yr549d
*  Spain – Catalonia’s leader failed to clarify by a Mon morning deadline whether he declared
the region independent. Spain has warned that anything but an unequivocal statement
would be taken as a declaration of secession and invite reprisal from Madrid. Catalonia
now has until Thurs morning to provide additional clarity. WSJ.
http://on.wsj.com/2gdue15
*  Iraq tensions escalate - Iraqi forces moved to recapture Kurdish-held oil fields and a military
base near the city of Kirkuk; the Iraqi gov’t was looking to recapture terrain it held prior to
2014 (when it abandoned the territory in the face of an ISIS assault) – Washington Post.
http://wapo.st/2zc0aKL
*  Japan – Abe’s ruling coalition is on track for a big win in the upcoming election (the election
takes place Sun 10/22) – Reuters http://reut.rs/2ynu7Io
*  Brexit – two of the world’s largest banks are now planning for a hard “Brexit” and will seek
to protect their access to the EU once the UK departs in 2019 – Bloomberg
https://bloom.bg/2xK2xZ6
*  S/TMUS – the companies will announce merger plans by the end of Oct or early Nov and the
agreement won’t call for immediate asset sales (the companies want to engage
w/regulators rather than volunteer asset sales) – Reuters http://reut.rs/2hJizrc
*  CHTR, VIA’b – the companies agreed to a short-term carriage extension so as to avoid an
immediate blackout of Viacom channels on CHTR’s systems – Reuters
http://nyti.ms/2yr561e
*  FB is looking to hire people w/national security clearance as it looks to battle against
foreign operators looking to exploit its social network – Bloomberg
*  GE – the WSJ thinks GE should be aggressive in resetting expectations and capitalized on
neg. investor sentiment; by frontloading the bad news now, GE could dramatically reset the
bar and begin delivering upside surprises for investors down the road – WSJ.
http://on.wsj.com/2zcVUuD
*  GE – the FT speculates on a dividend cut at GE – “GE is failing to cover its dividend
payments from its core operating cash flows, a position that is ultimately unsustainable”; GE
reports earnings Fri 10/20 and will update investors on 11/13; if the 11/13 restructuring
plan isn’t aggressive enough, GE’s new mgmt. team could face pressure to break the
company apart – FT http://on.ft.com/2kStpzO
*  Bombardier – the co is seeking investors for its aerospace businesses and is considering the
sale of some operations; Airbus could buy certain assets from Bombardier – Bloomberg.
https://bloom.bg/2gedsPc
*  ARMK will buy two private companies (Avendra and AmeriPride) for a combined $2.35B.
WSJ. http://on.wsj.com/2ylUDUY
*  Brooklyn Nets – Mikhail Prokhorov is seeking a valuation of ~$2B for the team as he pursues
a sale – NY Post. http://nyp.st/2wXryeB
Top Headlines from the Weekend
*  Sentiment – the cover article in this week’s Barron’s, entitled “Echoes of the 1987 Crash”
(http://bit.ly/2gjdXeu), can hardly be accused of optimism (it focuses on the market’s
structural changes and the rise of technology, including quant-based strategies and ETFs,
and how this could sow the seeds for an ’87-like crash) but its sentiments aren’t necessarily
unique either. The recent Economist title (from 10/7) lamented elevated asset valuations
(“The bull market in everything” http://econ.st/2xVXOjv) and warned of what will happen
once central banks begin withdrawing liquidity. BLK’s Larry Fink on Friday warned that risks
in the financial system at present are comparable to 2007 levels (http://reut.rs/2zmk5ax).
o Investors are right to be nervous but not necessarily because of technology or
central banks. Rather, the fact the economy is late-cycle with valuations near peak
levels is the main source of risk when it comes to equities. However, late-cycle
doesn’t mean end-cycle (as discussed in this JPMorgan note http://bit.ly/2wTZRCK)
and the absence of gross imbalances suggests a downturn isn’t imminent while
multiples can easily expand a few additional turns (and each turn means ~140 SPX
points given current earnings estimates while tax may add ~$7-10+ to EPS).
o Flow vs. stock – central bank liquidity. The Wall St narrative when it comes to
central banks and LSAPs tends to emphasize the “flow” piece of the equation (i.e.
the actual buying of assets) but it is in fact the ownership of assets (“stock”) that
acts as the mechanism for accommodation. Therefore rather than focus on central
bank buying to gauge the appropriation of liquidity it is more critical to assess
balance sheet size and on that basis central banks don’t appear on the cusp of an
acute liquidity withdrawal (as discussed in this JPMorgan note – G4 CB balance
sheets will be little changed over the next 3-4 years http://bit.ly/2xAACJL).
*  Yellen delivered comments Sun 10/15 in conjunction w/the IMF/World Bank meetings in
Washington. Overall her speech echoed many of the same sentiments she’s expressed in
recent communications and the a rate hike on 12/13 still seems likely. “Economic activity
in the United States has been growing moderately so far this year, and the labor market has
continued to strengthen”. Yellen says the recent storms will likely depress economic activity
but only temporarily (she thinks jobs growth will rebound from the depressed -33K pace of
Sept). “Wage indicators have been mixed, and the most recent news, on average hourly
earnings through September, was encouraging”. Yellen thinks inflation will firm from the
current soft trend (“my best guess is that these soft readings will not persist, and with the
ongoing strengthening of labor markets, I expect inflation to move higher next year”)
although she does acknowledge that something more structural may be occurring (“the
fact that a number of other advanced economies are also experiencing persistently low
inflation understandably adds to the sense among many analysts that something more
structural may be going on…. we will be paying close attention to the inflation data in the
months ahead”). http://bit.ly/2ykNjZM
o Kuroda spoke over the weekend in Washington and said the BOJ would continue
pursuing an aggressive monetary easing policy. “Achieving the 2% target is still a
long way off”. WSJ. http://on.wsj.com/2kPwAZ3
o Draghi spoke positively about Eurozone growth but he reiterated a cautious view
on inflation; Draghi said underlying inflation remains too weak and as a result the
ECB would need to continue providing large degrees of monetary accomodation.
WSJ http://on.wsj.com/2yLTeb9
o Central banks – tightening actions/rhetoric expected from three of the four major
central banks before the end of the year: EBC 10/26 (media reports suggest the
LSAP will be extended by 9 months w/the purchase pace tapered down from EU60B
to ~EU30B), BOE 11/2 (market expects a hike), and FOMC 12/13 (market expects a
hike).
*  Global central bankers and fin mins watch Fed chair process very closely – the identity of
the next Fed chair was as key topic of conversation at the weekend IMF/World Bank
meetings in Washington according to the WSJ (http://on.wsj.com/2gbzPor).
o Why will be the next Fed chair? All the media reports suggest the race is still
between Warsh and Powell (with the former person having a small edge) although
John Taylor’s name is being mentioned more (Thy God Emperor Trump interviewed Taylor at the
White House on Wed according to multiple media reports); of all the chair
candidates (Warsh, Powell, Yellen, Cohn, and Taylor), Taylor would likely cause the
most market disruption (at least initially). Larry Kudlow spoke on CNBC Fri
afternoon (after the market close) and said Thy God Emperor Trump’s decision could wind up being
a Warsh/Taylor combination (chair/vice chair).
*  Budget resolution vote coming up in the Senate (likely Thurs 10/19) - Larry Kudlow on
CNBC (at 4:40pmET Fri afternoon) reiterated that 50 GOP votes don't exist right now for
the budget resolution in the Senate (the vote is tentatively scheduled for Thurs
10/19). Republican Sen. Thad Cochran's health issues (which could keep him from
Washington) will complicate things for Republicans (Cochran was discussed in Politico Fri
morning http://politi.co/2i8Plpu).
o Sen. Collins said she would likely vote “yes” on the budget resolution this week
(passing the budget resolution is a necessary, but rather minor, step in the tax
process) – Reuters http://reut.rs/2wWzOvv
*  Taxes – passing a budget resolution is the easy part
o Republicans are still struggling to reach a consensus around the most controversial
pieces of the 9/27 blueprint. This week’s budget resolution vote is a necessary but
rather easy part of the tax process. The harder parts of the tax debate are still
waiting awaiting resolution – rates, brackets, income thresholds, deduction
changes, deficit tolerance, etc. BAT and SALT were supposed to be the key
incremental sources of revenue to pay for reduced rates but one is already scrapped
(BAT) and the other (SALT) is facing enormous resistance. Some media reports
suggest Republicans may reach a SALT compromise (whereby individuals with
annual incomes of ~$400K+ will lose the ability to deduct SALT) but this doesn’t
raise a whole lot of revenue. Even with reasonable dynamic scoring, it gets very
difficult to lower rates meaningfully without any incremental revenue.
o Tax – what will pass and when? Investors still think “something” can happen but
that something will likely be much less ambitious than the 9/27 GOP blueprint
(corporate rate to ~25-30% w/some lower/middle-income individual relief). Nearly
no one expects tax action in 2017.
o Tax – what is priced into stocks? This question is being asked w/increased
frequency but providing a precise answer is difficult. Roughly speaking, the St is
penciling in ~$138-143 in tax-free 2018 SPX EPS w/a tax bill adding ~$5-15. At the
middle of the tax-free range (i.e. $140) the SPX PE is ~18.2x – assuming investors
would try and keep the PE around ~17.5x that would imply a 2018 EPS expectation
of ~$145 which suggests stocks are assuming some benefit from tax (albeit a
relatively small one).
*  Thy God Emperor Trump risks overloading Congress – Thy God Emperor Trump has thrown several contentious issues in the lap
of Congress just as Senate and House Republicans undertake the most dramatic overhaul of
the tax code since ’86. Between immigration/DACA, the Iran nuclear pact, and
healthcare/ACA, Congress will be forced to act over the coming months while also juggling
the tax debate. WSJ http://on.wsj.com/2wUhTFF
o Thy God Emperor Trump’s move to end ACA exchange subsidies raises the risk of a gov’t shutdown
on 12/8; Democrats may demand the funds be authorized legislatively or threaten a
shutdown – Washington Post. http://wapo.st/2z7C7MT
*  Thy God Emperor Trump backs Bannon on pledge to primary insubordinate Republicans – Thy God Emperor Trump called
Bannon and offered words of encouragement to the former strategist over his pledge to

Politico http://politi.co/2ggN3nJ
o Drug price battle shifts from Washington to the states – pharma companies are
fighting a host of drug price-control measures being adopted by states across the
US. FT http://on.ft.com/2yLrcwp
*  NAFTA talks aren’t going well – demands made by the US last week have increased the
odds of NAFTA’s demise (at the least the demands make it unlikely an agreement on NAFTA
changes will be reached by the end of the year) – Reuters http://reut.rs/2zaxZM4
o NAFTA demise emerging as a new risk for investors – the risk of NAFTA collapsing is
rising and this is something investors are beginning to consider. WSJ
http://on.wsj.com/2yniIs8
*  China economic growth – China’s money supply statistics were released over the weekend
and they came in strong. M2 money supply rose 9.2% in Sept (vs. the St +8.9%) while new
yuan loans came in at CNY1.27T (vs. the St CNY1.2T); see JPMorgan’s takeaways here:
http://bit.ly/2wXModQ. The head of China’s central bank spoke over the weekend and said
economic indicators show “stabilized and stronger growth” (https://bloom.bg/2xHjYJy).
*  German coalition gov’t unlikely to form until 2018 – Reuters http://reut.rs/2yJ2JYo

*  Austria – Sebastian Kurz looks set to become the next chancellor of Austria although his
People’s Party (OVP) failed to win an outright majority (it secured 57 out of 183 seats). The
OVP is widely expected to form a coalition with the Freedom Party (FPO) which secured 51
seats. CNN. http://cnn.it/2ykzIlo

Calendar of events for the Week of Mon Oct 16
*  Calendar of events for the week of Mon 10/16 – the main focus this week will be on
earnings, China, and US taxes. The China National Congress kicks off Wed 10/18 and the
country will be publishing a lot of eco data (inflation out Mon morning 10/16 and Q3 GDP
along w/Sept retail sales/IP/FAI out Thurs morning 10/19). Investors will keep an eye on
North Korea as media reports suggest the country could fire off some missiles around the
China Congress. In the US investors will be digesting earnings (the week of 10/16 is the first
busy one of the CQ3 season) and macro news should be limited aside from some Fed
speakers (including Yellen who speaks Fri 10/20 after the close). The US tax process will
continue w/the Senate voting on a budget resolution (likely Thurs 10/19) - passage is
expected but the final vote will likely be close; Rand Paul seems a hard “no” while McCain
and a few others are question marks; investors will be watching to see if any Democrats
cross the aisle. Keep in mind that the Senate budget resolution will need to be reconciled
w/the one from the House. Finally, the EU Leaders Summit runs 10/19-20 and the Japanese
snap election takes place Sun 10/22.

"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning January 6th, 2020",97,ejx893,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ejx893/wall_street_week_ahead_for_the_trading_week/,25,2020-01-04 19:57:23,"Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 6th, 2020.

# **Geopolitical tensions could hold back stocks in the week ahead, as investors await jobs report  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/03/geopolitical-tensions-could-hold-back-stocks-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> Geopolitical concerns could continue to weigh on stocks in the week ahead, leaving investors wondering whether Middle East tensions will be the catalyst for a much anticipated market pullback.
*****
> Stocks sold off Friday, the second trading day of the year, after a rally to new highs on Thursday. The market was slammed after the U.S. killed Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani, sparking a rally in oil prices and raising concerns Iran will take some retaliatory action.
*****
> The big event in the coming week is the December employment report, expected to show 160,000 payrolls were added and average earnings rose 3.1% year-over-year, according to Refinitiv. The jobs report is especially important after December’s ISM manufacturing data Friday was surprisingly negative and the weakest in more than a decade.
*****
> The S&P 500 ended the four-day week at 3,235, with a loss of 0.2%, after Friday’s 0.7% decline. Treasury yields retreated on Friday, as buyers moved into the safety of bonds and the 10-year yield was at 1.78%.
*****
> “This was a textbook rationale for a bout of profit taking, but that said, I don’t think it’s dramatic,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. “Nonetheless, the question will be when do buyers come in ... Much will depend on this weekend and next week in terms of headlines from both the White House and Iran.”
*****
> Some analysts have been looking for a minor selloff in stocks after the fourth quarter’s 8.5% gain in the S&P 500. But whether Friday’s decline is the start of something bigger is unclear.
*****
> “It could be, but only in retrospect will you know for sure,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group.
*****
> Boockvar said if Iran takes some minor action, the market could shrug it off, oil could lose its gains, and stocks could move higher again.
*****
> “We may see Treasurys continue to get a big bid, gold get a bid and the safe-haven currencies get a bid. If we go into things next week and all things are quiet, the market will pay attention to the data,” Krosby said.
*****
> Gregory Faranello, head of U.S. rates at AmeriVet Securities, expects to see Treasury yields lower initially. “I think short-term, the geopolitical risk is probably going to override any fundamental views that people have of the marketplace,” he said.
*****
> But there could be a catalyst for some Treasury selling with the issuance of high level of corporate bonds in the coming week. Faranello expects the year to start off strong, with corporate treasurers looking to raise about $30 billion to $35 billion in the debt market.
*****
> Strategists said they will be looking closely at the jobs data after Friday’s surprisingly weak manufacturing survey from the Institute for Supply Management, which was expected to have been better because of the trade agreement.
*****
> Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont, said the survey actually took place before the trade deal was announced, and he’s waiting for the results of the next couple of reports.
*****
> He expects to see 165,000 jobs added in December, off of 266,000 in November, which was in part skewed by the end of GM’s strike. “I think there’s a little upside risk. It seems like we saw a pretty strong Christmas season,” he said, adding there could have been more hiring than was factored into seasonal adjustments.

# Typical January Trading: Volatile Last 20 Years

> Yesterday major indexes continued their recent trend of strength on the first trading day of 2020. While today the market has turned weaker on escalating tensions between the U.S. and Iran. This type of volatility was once quite rare in January. However since 2000, the S&P 500 has declined ten times in twenty years in January. This recent weakness can be seen in the above January seasonal pattern chart.

> Over the last 21 years, Only NASDAQ has posted a full-month average gain. DJIA, S&P 500 and Russell 1000 have started January positive, only to surrender early-month gains by the eighth trading day. Greatest weakness has appeared just after mid-month, the eleventh trading day. Mild average losses on or around the eleventh trading day quickly swell to over 2% for DJIA and nearly as much for S&P 500 and Russell 1000.

> 2019 was surely a banner year for US equities. With a total return of 31.5%, the S&P 500's gain in 2019 was nearly three times the historical average 12-month return of 11.7%. That's strong! In the chart below we compare the S&P 500's annualized returns over the last one, two, five, ten, and twenty years to its average annualized returns over those same time frames since 1928. While the one-year return sticks out like a sore thumb, we would note that the S&P 500's annualized returns over the last two, three, and ten years are also above average. Almost as notable as the fact that the one year return has been so much stronger than average is that the S&P 500's two-year return is less than two percentage points above its historical average. That just shows how bad 2018 was! Looking further out, the only time frame where returns are below average is over the last twenty years where the 6.1% annualized gain is almost five percentage points below the historical average. Over a full twenty years, that's a difference of tripling your investment versus making eight times your investment!

> The chart below compares how current returns during the above time frames rank on a percentile basis relative to all other periods. The S&P 500's one-year return ranks in the 85th percentile which is pretty extreme. For the two, five, and ten year periods, though, current returns are much more middle of the road. Conversely, as stretched as extreme to the upside that the one-year return is relative to all other periods, the twenty-year return is even more depressed to the downside. At just 4.6, more than 95% of all other 20-year periods have been better than the last 20.

> Finally, as mentioned above the last year has certainly been a strong one, and it follows a year where returns had been abnormally poor. The chart below shows the rolling 12-month total return for the S&P 500 going back to 1990. The gain of 31.49% over the last year was the strongest for the S&P 500 in six years coming up just shy of the 32.39% gain in 2013. Last year at this time, though, the S&P 500 was down over 4% on a total return basis in the prior 12 months.

# 2019 and 2020 Dogs of the Dow

> The Dogs of the Dow strategy is a simple, hands-off investment approach that says to buy the 10 highest yielding stocks in the Dow 30 at the start of each year. With the calendar turning over from 2019 to 2020, below is a look at how the Dogs strategy performed in 2019. As shown, the 10 Dogs posted a total return of 19.38% in 2019, which was below the 25% return for the Dow and well below the 28% that the 20 non-Dogs returned. The biggest winner in the Dogs in 2019 was JP Morgan (JPM) with a gain of 47.27%, but Pfizer's (PFE) decline of 6.92% really hurt overall performance.

> The 20 non-Dogs were led by Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Visa (V), and United Tech (UTX), while Walgreens Boots (WBA) and 3M (MMM) were the two non-Dogs that fell in 2019.

> Moving on to 2020, below is a list of this year's Dogs of the Dow. Eight of the ten Dogs from 2019 remain on the list, while 3M (MMM) and Walgreens Boots (WBA) -- the two non-Dogs that fell in 2019 -- have replaced JP Morgan (JPM) and Procter & Gamble (PG) -- the two biggest gainers of the Dogs in 2019. Dow Inc. (DOW) is the highest yielding Dog at 5.12%, followed by Exxon (XOM), IBM, and Verizon (VZ), which all have dividend yields above 4%.

# Full Year 2019, Q4, and December Asset Class Total Returns

> Below are the final total return performance numbers for key ETFs across asset classes in 2019. For each ETF, we also include its performance in Q4 and December.

> The S&P 500 rallied 2.9% in December and 8.99% in Q4 to finish the full year up 31.22%. The Tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) was by far the best performing US index ETF in 2019 with a gain of 38.96%, and it was the third best ETF in the entire matrix. The title of best performing ETF in 2019 goes to the S&P 500 Technology sector ETF (XLK), which rallied 49.86%. Remember, 40% of XLK is made up of just Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT), which gained 89% and 58% in 2019, respectively. The Russia stock market ETF (RSX) was the second biggest winner in the matrix with a 2019 total return of 40.79%.

> Everywhere you look across the equity landscape, there were big winners in 2019, but the weakest area of the market was the Energy sector ETF (XLE). Even still, XLE managed to put up double-digit percentage gains on the year at +11.74%.

> In the commodities space, we saw oil gain 32.61% in 2019, which actually bested the gain for the S&P 500. Gold (GLD) and silver (SLV) both put in solid gains in the mid-teens, while the perpetually losing natural gas ETF (UNG) was the only ticker in the matrix that fell across all three time frames (December, Q4, and full year).

> Looking at fixed income, the aggregate bond market ETFs (AGG and BND) posted total returns of 8%+, while the 20+ Year Treasury ETF (TLT) gained 14% on the year. Q4 and December were tough for fixed income, however, as rates moved higher.

# January Almanac: Average Performance Slips in Presidential Election Years

> January has quite a reputation on Wall Street as an influx of cash from yearend bonuses and annual allocations typically propels stocks higher. January ranks #1 for NASDAQ (since 1971), but fifth on the S&P 500 and sixth for DJIA since 1950. It is the end of the best three-month span and holds a full docket of indicators and seasonalities.

> DJIA and S&P rankings did slip from 2000 to 2016 as both indices suffered losses in ten of those seventeen Januarys with three in a row, 2008, 2009 and 2010 and then again in 2014 to 2016. January 2009 has the dubious honor of being the worst January on record for DJIA (-8.8%) and S&P 500 (-8.6%) since 1901 and 1931 respectively. Last year, January was downright stellar after the worst December since 1931 for DJIA and S&P 500.

> In election years, Januarys have been weaker. DJIA and S&P 500 slip to number #8 while DJIA average performance dips negative. NASDAQ slips to #3, but average performance remains respectable at 1.7%.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

*****

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/wallstreetbets."
Verizon Moons,4,t7os6z,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/t7os6z/verizon_moons/,16,2022-03-06 07:50:12,"Positioned in the next quarter to out perform the earning of its two largest competitors, VZ has a team of executives that are uniquely talented in the communication industry. Already the 5g rollout is pushing profits upwards, and as technology continues to inovate, the upward trend will steepen.

Ok, most people have stopped reading, so I'll just post a copy paste from wikipedia so my post isn't too short. Obviously the 2 word title is sufficient. In 1984, the United States Department of Justice mandated AT&T Corporation to break up the Bell System into seven companies, each a Regional Bell Operating Company (RBOC), commonly referred to as ""Baby Bells"". Bell Atlantic,[11] one of the Baby Bells, came into existence the same year. Headquartered in Philadelphia, it became the parent of New Jersey Bell, Bell of Pennsylvania, Diamond State Telephone, and the C&P Telephone companies, with a trading area from New Jersey to Virginia.

As part of a rebranding of the Baby Bells in the mid-1990s, all of Bell Atlantic's operating companies assumed the holding company's name. In 1997, Bell Atlantic expanded into New York and the New England states by merging with fellow Baby Bell NYNEX. While Bell Atlantic was the surviving company, the merged company moved its headquarters from Philadelphia to NYNEX's old headquarters in New York City. In 2000, Bell Atlantic acquired GTE, which operated telecommunications companies across most of the rest of the country not already in Bell Atlantic's footprint. Bell Atlantic, the surviving entity, changed its name to Verizon, a portmanteau of veritas (Latin for ""truth"") and horizon.[12]

In 2015, Verizon expanded into content ownership by acquiring AOL,[13][14] and two years later, it acquired Yahoo!.[15] AOL and Yahoo were amalgamated into a new division named Oath Inc.,[16] which was rebranded as Verizon Media in January 2019, and was spun off and rebranded to Yahoo! after its sale to Apollo Global Management.

As of 2016, Verizon is one of three remaining companies with roots in the former Baby Bells. The other two, like Verizon, exist as a result of mergers among fellow former Baby Bell members. SBC Communications bought the Bells' former parent AT&T Corporation and took on the AT&T name, and CenturyLink acquired Qwest (formerly US West) in 2011 and later became Lumen Technologies in 2020.

Verizon's mobile network is the largest wireless carrier in the United States, with 120.9 million subscribers as of the end of Q4 2020.[17] And as of 2017, Verizon is the only publicly traded telecommunications company that has two stock listings in its home country, both the NYSE (principal) and NASDAQ (secondary).[18] As of 2017, it is also the second largest telecommunications company by revenue after AT&T.

#Trading Update

* What’s happening this morning? Once again it was a slow evening. The US newswires are
filled w/previews of today’s big tax unveil but all the major numbers have been circulating
in the press for several days at least (see full preview below) and thus the actual release
may wind up being anticlimactic (note that Thy God-Emperor Trump is due to speak in Indiana on the subject
at ~3pmET). Keep in mind that the Wed tax blueprint is just the beginning of what will be
a very long and arduous process; while the odds of passing “something” are relatively good,
that “something” will likely look a lot different from what Republicans will unveil today
(the GOP plan is too ambitious and will need to be pared down). Overall US politics
dominated the overnight narrative as Moore won in Alabama (as expected), healthcare dies
(also as expected), Corker retires (not a complete shock but not fully anticipated),
“Establishment” Republicans shutter, Mueller advances, taxes arrive, and more. Eco
data/monetary policy was relatively minimal overnight (although the industrial profits
figure out of China was positive). The main co-specific news highlights included MU (solid
Q/guide; only mild neg. was elevated capital spending number but on the whole this was a
strong print), NKE (Q was OK but the guide fell short and the stock slumped during the afterhours
session), and Alstom/Siemens (they formally announced a merger of their train
operations). The major Eurozone indices are sitting on decent gains (up ~30-50bp); banks
are leading on the upside (SX7P up ~1.5%) thanks to the ongoing embrace of reflation
themes globally (recall this is a multi-week trading trend). Incidentally, the US BKX advance
remains very powerful and still has legs – the sector paused Fri/Mon but is having a hard
time sustaining material downside and eked out a small gain on Tues (it seems like this
latest BKX rally will be the one to finally break it up and out of its months-long trading
range). The major Asian indices were mixed – TPX -0.5%, NKY -0.31%, Hang Seng +0.47%,
SHCOMP +0.05%, HSCEI +0.61%, Taiwan TAIEX +0.68%, Korea KOSPI -0.07%, Australia -
0.12%, and India down ~1.1%. Taiwan’s TAIEX bounced following the US tech rally on Tues
(Largan +5.5%, Hon Hai +1.45%, TSMC +0.47%, Nanya Tech +4.3%, MediaTek +1.95%, etc.);
note that the US tech rally on Tues felt somewhat tentative and it seems like the space has
more to go on the downside over the coming days and weeks. US S&P futures are up ~2-4
points. The USD continues to rip higher (it’s up another ~40bp this morning) thanks to a
combination of Germany (as the election outcome continues to pressure the EUR), tax
anticipation (even though the tax plan will likely be deficit-negative, the USD is focused for
now on its growth implications), and Yellen (as the odds of a Dec hike continue to creep
higher).
* Calendar of events for Wed 9/27 – the focus will be on US durable goods for Aug
(8:30amET), US pending home sales for Aug (10amET), Fed speakers (Kashkari, Brainard,
Bullard and Rosengren), the Republican tax plan (Thy God-Emperor Trump to speak on the subject in Indiana
at ~3pmET), analyst meetings (AMAT, DLPH, KMX, PANW, and SPR), and earnings (ATU preopen
and JBL, PIR, PRGS, and THO after the close).

#Top Headlines for Wednesday

US politics – it was a big night of news as Moore wins, healthcare dies, Corker retires,
“Establishment” Republicans shutter, Mueller advances, taxes arrive, and more.

*  Republican tax blueprint – what to expect on Wed 9/27. It isn’t clear just how
much detail Republicans plan on releasing but the initial rough draft will likely call
for 1) bringing the corporate rate down to ~20% (from 35%), 2) cutting the top
“pass-through” (i.e. small business) rate to 25% (from 39.5%), 3) collapsing the
current seven individual brackets down to three (new brackets will be 12%, 25%,
and 35%), 4) cutting the top individual rate to 35% (from 39.5%) although the
language may allow for the creation of a new top individual rate if Congress needs
to find extra revenue, 5) a doubling of the individual standard deduction, 6)
eliminating the deductibility of corporate interest expense in some form (the
language around this topic will probably be vague), 7) immediate expensing of
corporate capital expenditures (although this may only be for a ~5 year period), 8) a
“deemed” tax on all accumulated overseas earnings (likely at a reduced rate of
~10%), 9) eliminating the deductibility of state/local taxes on individual returns (it
sounds like the proposal will retain the deductibility of mortgage interest and
charitable donations), and 10) eliminating the estate tax. In total, the plan will call
for tax cuts worth ~$5T over 10 years w/Republicans planning on recouping more
than half of that lost revenue by eliminating various tax breaks (not all of which will
be outlined today). Combined w/dynamic scoring, the net tax cut number over 10
years is thought to be around ~$1.5T. Overall, the Wed draft should only be
thought of as a “best case” opening offer as it won’t likely resemble the final
agreement (to the extent there even is a final agreement). Most assume the
ultimate bill will simply cut the corporate rate from 35% to ~25-27% w/some action
 on the repatriation front and w/o substantive deduction (or individual) changes. As
for timing, it is expected that this will be a Q1:2018 event.
* Thy God-Emperor Trump will begin advocating for the tax bill at an event in Indiana on Wed (he is
scheduled to begin speaking around 3pmET) but some Republicans are worried
about what he’ll say – Thy God-Emperor Trump’s lack of message discipline, coupled w/his
extemporaneous speaking style, is making Republicans nervous as they head into
the heart of the tax process. Politico http://politi.co/2wVJ5mw
* McCain makes similar demands on taxes that he did for healthcare (McCain was
instrumental in killing the last two ACA repeal/replace attempts) – McCain is
demanding regular order and a bipartisan approach to the tax process – Bloomberg
https://bloom.bg/2hvOG17
* Taxes - House Freedom Caucus head (Mark Meadows) sets out tough ""red lines""
for upcoming tax debate - Meadows said he would vote against a tax reform
measure if it included a corporate tax rate higher than 20% (the GOP blueprint on
Wed is likely to propose 20% but most think the final number will likely be closer to
25% if not higher), set a small business rate at more than 25 percent (the Wed
proposal will contain a ""pass-through"" rate of 25%), and didn’t double the standard
deduction for individuals (the proposal is expected to do this). The
Hill. http://bit.ly/2fPdzRy
*  Wilbur Ross says tax reform “done right” could boost annual GDP growth by
~100bp – CNBC http://cnb.cx/2wW5253
*  Moore’s win (following the failure to repeal ACA and Corker’s retirement) spells
trouble for “establishment” Republicans heading into ’18 midterms – Moore’s
victory will embolden conservative challengers across the country, setting the stage
for “a wave of resource-draining primaries”. McConnell is apparently increasingly
concerned about the Republican majority; he had hoped to head into the ’18
midterms on the offensive but isn’t as confident now. Politico
http://politi.co/2xvU36Y
*  The healthcare reconciliation deadline of 9/30 won’t be extended – while some in
the GOP want to extend the 9/30 healthcare reconciliation deadline and couple the
issue w/taxes, Congressional Republican leaders have squashed this idea
(http://bit.ly/2k0O9oG). Once the deadline passes on 9/30 the repeal/replace
debate will (finally) end (at least until 11/7/18).
*  Infrastructure spending plan increasingly in doubt – Thy God-Emperor Trump apparently is skeptical
about the practicality of public-private partnerships when it comes to infrastructure
spending. This had been the heart of the GOP infrastructure plan and thus Thy God-Emperor Trump’s
new views would point to the odds of an actual bill passing being even lower than
previously thought. Washington Post http://wapo.st/2fx3z2q
*  US/Canada trade – Washington said it would impose stiff tariffs on sales of a new
Bombardier jetliner to US airlines. Meanwhile, Alstom and Siemens decided to
move forward w/a merger of their train operations (Bombardier had been involved
in the negotiations but wound up being left out). WSJ. http://on.wsj.com/2fPNr9e
*  Mueller could begin interviewing current and former White House staff as soon as
later this week (CNN http://cnn.it/2jYI6Rs) and the IRS is now providing
information to the probe (http://cnn.it/2wVdbGO). Meanwhile, Paul Manafort
expects to be indicted (http://nyti.ms/2xvNst5).
* Acting DEA head Chuck Rosenberg will step down after clashing w/the White
House; Rosenberg had become convinced that Thy God-Emperor Trump had little respect for the law –
NYT http://nyti.ms/2foG47W
* Economic data/monetary policy recap for Wed 9/27 – it was a pretty uneventful morning.
China industrial profits came in +24% Y/Y in Aug, a solid acceleration vs. +16.5% posted in
Jul (http://bit.ly/2xvxmzE). Europe’s M3 money supply growth for Aug came in +5% (ahead
of the St’s +4.6% foreacst). A new survey finds that German exporters are increaisngly
upbeat on the business outlook despite a rising euro (http://reut.rs/2fQlJsW).
*  San Francisco Fed President Williams conducted an interview
w/Centralbanking.com (the headlines hit after the US market closed). Williams
reiterated his prior call for the Fed to consider a higher inflation target but he
added that this is something central banks should contemplate on a coordinated
basis globally. Williams thinks the 2% inflation target utilized by most central banks
around the world will be ""suboptimal"" over the next 10 years. Williams also thinks
that policies once considered unconventional (like QE, forward guidance, etc.) will in
fact become conventional. http://bit.ly/2fqe3gi
* Europe has too many banks according to an ECB official - Daniele Nouy, the ECB’s top bank
supervisor, said Europe had too many banks and called on the industry to shrink and
consolidate. Reuters. http://reut.rs/2fAsUbP

#Company-specific news update from Tues night 9/26. 

* It was a pretty slow evening other than a couple of high-profile Aug-end earnings reports. MU posted very strong Aug-end
results and guided Nov above the St and while the numbers should be enough to stabilize
the stock it seems like the tech sell-off in general still has a bit more to go (MU’s F18 capex
guide of $7.5B was above $6-6.5B estimates and the news briefly hit the stock after-hours
although mgmt. on the call made clear none of the money was going towards expanding its
wafer capacity). NKE’s results were OK for the Q, esp. given horrendous sentiment around
the stock and the category; the stock briefly bounced Tues night on the news before sliding
lower deeper in the after-hours session (the guidance, given out on the call, fell short of
expectations). Elsewhere, TWTR said it would explore an expansion of its character limit
(from 140 to 280 characters http://on.wsj.com/2hvDCRF) while Alstom and Siemens
formally announced their train merger plans (http://on.wsj.com/2jZXUmZ).
* S/Sprint, TMUS - the FCC approved (by a 3-2 vote) a new report concluding that there is
now “effective competition” in the US wireless market for the first time since 2009; the
ruling could help pave the way for a TMUS-Sprint combination (http://reut.rs/2xzmuhG).
* Nippon Life, Japan’s largest private-sector life insurer, is in talks to buy a 20-30% stake in
US asset manager TCW Group from Carlyle (which owns ~60%). TCW had ~$200B in AUM
as of the end of June. Reuters. http://reut.rs/2hviWsN
* Chinese cities order steel output cuts to begin earlier than expected in a bid to curb
pollution – Reuters http://reut.rs/2hylhQb
Calendar of events to watch for the week of Mon Sept 25
* Calendar of events for Thurs 9/28 – the focus will be on Eurozone confidence measures for
Sept (5amET), German inflation for Sept (8amET), the BOE “20 Years On” conf. in London
(at which Carney will speak), US Q2 data revisions (8:30amET), US advance goods trade
balance for Aug (8:30amET), Fed speakers (George, Fischer, Bostic), Brady’s comments on
tax reform, analyst meetings (AEE and AFL), and earnings (ACN, BBRY, CAG, MKC, MTN, and
RAD pre-open and KBH and SGH after the close).
* Calendar of events for Fri 9/29 – the focus will be on the China Caixin manufacturing PMI
for Sept (Thurs night/Fri morning), the German jobs data for Sept (3:55amET), Eurozone CPI
for Sept (5amET), US personal income/spending for Aug (8:30amET), the US PCE for Aug
(8:30amET), the Chicago PMI for Sept (9:45amET), the final Michigan Confidence numbers
for Sept (10amET), Fed speakers (Harker), and analyst meetings (CMP).
US equity bull vs. bear debate – Tues 9/26/17
* Bottom Line: US equities wobbled briefly around mid-Aug but quickly (and unexpectedly)
found their footing before levitating back to fresh highs throughout H2:Aug and H1:Sept. A
big driver of stock stability has been a macro landscape that is unfolding in a much less
volatile and uncontroversial fashion than feared coupled with the market’s ability to cleanly
rotate from sector to sector. The one main constant of the last several months has been a
relatively healthy real growth backdrop and thus this will hold the key for stocks going
forward (i.e. it will be growth and not North Korea, the Fed, Thy God-Emperor Trump, etc., that will determine
if and when the rally reverses). The recent appearance of firmer inflation figures globally,
coupled w/ongoing real growth stability, has helped to fuel a reembrace of reflation themes
(more specifically TSY weakness and bank strength) and a continuation of this trend would
be the ideal scenario for the broader tape (the two caveats are the USD and tech – the
former can’t spike higher and the latter’s weakness needs to stay relatively orderly and
calm).

#Reasons to be optimistic

* Nothing changes – real growth stays steady (below “escape velocity” but in the ~2-2.5% real
GDP range), inflation firms but stays at or slightly below central bank targets, central banks
stay on the normalization path but proceed at an extraordinarily subdued pace, the USD
doesn’t rally materially, and Corporate America performance remains robust (thanks to
aggressive cost containment, a softer USD, healthy global growth, etc.). Such a scenario
would encourage the gentle pro-reflation market biases of the last few weeks.
* Monetary policy will stay enormously accommodative even with Fed tightening -
JPMorgan’s Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote about the G4 (FOMC, ECB, BOE, and BOJ) central
banks and projects that aggregate balance sheets will be little changed over the coming 3-
4 years despite Fed normalization (the note was published 9/22 http://bit.ly/2xAACJL). As
Bernanke noted on numerous occasions during the financial crisis, QE provides
accommodation via “stock” and not “flow” (i.e. it is the ownership of assets that matters
and central bank balance sheets will stay enlarged for years to come).
* Recession risk not imminent – JPMorgan’s Joe Lupton and Bruce Kasman addressed the
risks of a US recession and don’t think they are particularly large in the near-term (the note
was published 9/20/17). Recessions are related to: 1) weakening labor productivity; 2)
downward pressure on corporate margins; 3) central bank tightening; 4) real and financial
private sector imbalances. Although we anticipate these vulnerabilities to eventually arise,
they are not particularly threatening at present. Monetary policy is still easy and being
normalized at a glacial pace. The near-term risk of recession is not large, but the US could
prove to be the catalyst for the next DM downturn. The full note can be found here:
http://bit.ly/2wTZRCK.
* The odds of Republicans accomplishing something on the tax front are decent – while it’s
very unlikely the corporate rate gets down to 15% or 20%, the GOP should be able to clip a
few hundred basis points off the corporate rate by the end of CQ1:18 (in conjunction
w/some type of action easing the repatriation of overseas earnings).
* Kelly continues to exert a positive influence at the White House – Donald Thy God-Emperor Trump will never
be without controversy but the Kelly-run White House has been a much more disciplined
and focused institution compared to the chaos that seemed to reign under Reince. If this
can continue (and that is a big “if” as the divisive NFL remarks make clear) it will help
Republicans pass pieces of their pro-growth agenda.
* Debt ceiling no longer considered a key negotiating tool – while both sides still make
demands around the debt ceiling process this no longer is an instrument about which either
side are very comfortable making serious threats.
* Valuations are rich but not ridiculous – investors are assuming ~$140 in ’18 SPX EPS and
that doesn’t include much happening in Washington (a tax bill could add $7-10+ in EPS). At
2500 the SPX is trading at ~17.8x a $140 number (that falls to ~17x if taxes winds up
bumping $140 to ~$145-147).
* Sentiment is far from euphoric – while the VIX remains subdued it’s hard to accuse the
market of being effusive or complacent as investors are anxious over a host of issues
(balance sheet normalization, NK missiles, White House dysfunction, elevated valuations,
etc.).

#Reasons to be cautious

* Yields hit fresh lows in response to softening nominal growth – while many regard the
prospect of a “taper tantrum”-like move (around upcoming balance sheet normalization) to
be the biggest risk facing stocks, a larger headwind for the market could come from a surge
in TSYs (and slump in yields) as a result of nominal growth weakness (softness in real
growth would have a larger impact than further disinflation).
* The yield curve flattens aggressively as Fed tightening elevates 2yr yields while 10yr yields
hold steady or drift lower – a flattening driven by 10yr strength (i.e. 10yr yields moving
lower) would be a larger risk to stocks than one spurred by Fed-driven 2yr weakness (i.e. 2yr
yields moving higher) but regardless sustained flattening wouldn’t be helpful for risk
sentiment (in particular banks would be at risk in such a scenario).
* Central banks sow concern via either policy and/or staffing changes. Three of the world’s
major central banks are proceeding with gradual normalization but this isn’t likely to pose
much near-term risk to stocks (as policy in aggregate remains extraordinarily
accommodative). The next big events to watch are the ECB on 10/26 (at which it will
provide 2018 tapering guidance) and the BOE on 11/2 (at which it is expected to raise rates).
Instead of policy the bigger risks are prob. around staffing, esp. at the Fed where Thy God-Emperor Trump
has several positions to fill (including the chair). Meanwhile, Kuroda’s term at the BOJ ends
in Apr ’18 (Draghi and Carney will be in office for a while longer – Carney’s term ends June
’19 and Draghi is in place until Oct ’19).
* Republicans fail to pass any substantive pieces of pro-growth legislation before the Nov
’18 midterms – the GOP failed to move repeal/replace through Congress and the tax debate
is proving to be just as divisive as healthcare (prominent Republican Senators Hatch and
Corker have both warned that taxes will be more difficult than healthcare was). The odds of
passing a tax bill are higher than healthcare (the former isn’t nearly as controversial as the
latter) but the initial GOP blueprint is too ambitious and will need to be pared down over
the coming months.
* Tax details surprise – most are anticipating a mild cut to the corporate rate w/o any
substantive changes to the code. However, while the BAT has been discarded Washington
still could look towards other areas to raise revenue (including eliminating the deductibility
of corporate interest expense and/or individual state and local taxes).
* Fiscal challenges still loom – current legislation funds the government only until 12/8 which
means a shutdown could occur around year-end if budget progress isn’t achieved (and note
that a budget is necessarily in order to pass taxes via reconciliation). The debt ceiling likely
won’t become binding again until the end of CQ1:18 at the earliest.
* USD spikes – the months-long stretch of USD softness has helped underwrite the equity
rally and thus a prolonged period of strength would undermine stock enthusiasm. However,
while the German election outcome bolstered the USD (by weakening the EUR), it doesn’t
seem like an extended stretch of strengthening is imminent (other central banks are
normalizing alongside the FOMC while the nominal growth differential doesn’t grossly favor
the US vs. other major economies).
* Geopolitical risks remain unresolved – North Korea is moving forward w/its nuclear and
missile programs, Syria is still unresolved, the battle against ISIS continues, eastern Ukraine
remains under occupation, tensions between Iran and Gulf States persist in the Middle East,
and more. While NK is dominating the geopolitical narrative, the status of the Iran nuclear
deal may be just as big a threat (Thy God-Emperor Trump has a decision to make in Oct about whether Iran is
compliant w/that agreement).
* Difficult for the US economy to overcome its enormous structural headwinds – the
conversation around the growth potential of the US economy remains too optimistic with
not enough appreciation given to the extraordinary structural headwinds facing it (namely
tepid productivity and demographic trends). Regardless of what happens in Washington it
will be difficult to return to ‘90s-like economic growth.

Happy Sunday to all of you on this subreddit. I hope everyone made out pretty good last week in the market, and are ready for the new trading week ahead! :)

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 28th, 2019.

# **Apple, Microsoft and Amazon could drive the market in the next wave of earnings  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/25/apple-microsoft-and-amazon-are-in-the-next-wave-of-earnings-.html)**
*****
> The earnings season is about to get a lot more interesting with about a quarter of the S&P 500, nearly half of the Dow Jones Industrials and three of the four biggest companies in the world reporting in the week ahead.
*****
> Mega-cap tech companies Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon report respectively on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. There will be heavy focus on them, not just because they are the biggest stocks — Microsoft first, then Amazon and Apple fourth — but because they represent growth and have been market leaders. Facebook, the sixth largest stock by market cap, also reports on Wednesday.
*****
> The bar has already been lowered for Apple, after its warning of a revenue shortfall.
*****
> ""They're really important for a variety of reasons. Number one is their influence on the market. But also they're multinational companies, and they'll give us an idea of what's going on overseas. Growth is slowing dramatically and these overseas businesses are not going to be immune,"" said Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Advisory Group.
*****
> About 72 percent of the companies that have reported earnings as of Friday morning have beaten expectations. In terms of revenue, however, there are just 58 percent that beat forecasts, down from about 70 percent in recent quarters. That means a much higher 42 percent have missed revenue expectations so far, according to Refinitiv data.
*****
> Also concerning in the earnings data is the fact that first quarter earnings growth expectations have been shrinking, and are now nearly flat — at only 2 percent growth seen for S&P 500 earnings in the current quarter, ending March 31. That number had been more than 5 percent on Jan. 1, and while it had been expected to slow, flat growth was not in most analysts' forecasts.
*****
> The coming week's reports will come from a wide range of industries, including big energy with ExxonMobil and Chevron Friday; industrials like General Electric and Illinois ToolWorks and drug makers Merck and Pfizer.
*****
> Earnings growth expectations for the fourth quarter have been just above 14 percent, including forecasts and actual reports of the companies that already reported.
*****
> Lori Calvasina, RBC chief U.S. equity strategist, said tech will be an important group to watch. ""This has been one of the most problematic sectors since Dec. 31, in terms of earnings downgrades. There's been a lot of chatter out of semis this week. That had been the group in tech that was most derisked from an earnings expectations perspective. Expectations have really come down since last August, and since November came down very sharply,"" she said.
*****
> Semiconductor stocks rallied in the past week, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index up 4.4 percent for the week, as of Friday. A number of semiconductor names, like Xilinx and Texas Instruments beat earnings forecasts, though sector heavyweight Intel was disappointing.
*****
> Calvasina said she is concerned that earnings expectations for some other tech sectors may not have been adjusted downward enough. She said hardware company earnings forecasts had begun to come down in the fall, but there weren't many cuts to software sector profit forecasts. Calvasina said the companies where revisions were strong paved the way for a post-earnings stock pop, if the companies could beat lowered guidance.
*****
> ""In the first two weeks of January, the market tone was buy the dips. It's been a bit more of a cautionary tone this week. One of the things people have been cautious on, and are worrying about is whether the market can continue to climb higher, if it's favorite sector is seeing earnings downgrades,"" she said, pointing to the technology and communications services sectors.
*****
> ""I felt a lot better about that after hearing from financials reporting in week one. I read through those earnings call transcripts, and what I was seeing was there was a storm int he markets, there was a storm in fixed in come market in Q4 but that was not in the underlying economy,"" she said. ""In the first two weeks of January, nobody wanted to touch the financials, but now with the leadership rotation it does seem possible to me.""
*****
> The Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF XLF was up 1.2 percent Friday, and is up 9.5 percent since Jan. 1.
*****
> Some of the biggest names in the market are also, by default, among the most widely held names in many mutual funds portfolios. In a December RBC report, Microsoft was listed as the most widely held by large cap core, growth and value stock funds in the third quarter. Second was Alphabet, which reports earnings in the following week, and Apple was third.
*****
> ""When crowded names miss, they tend to be psychologically devastating. You always want to be extra vigilant on crowded names heading into reporting season,"" Calvasina said. ""Misses tend to get people off guard when they happen.""
*****
> As for big tech earnings, Apple has already warned that its iPhone sales in China took a big hit, and analysts have lowered their expectations for earnings this quarter. They also expect iPhone sales weakness to continue into this year.
*****
> Microsoft, on the other hand, has far less exposure to China, and Piper Jaffray analysts make a case for it to beat estimates, based on its historical performance.""The combination of top line outperformance and cost discipline has allowed for Microsoft to materially outperform on the bottom line. Although a repeat of performance is not guaranteed...we model a scenario in line with historical averages that supports EPS outperformance relative to guidance of ~$0.12 or EPS of $1.20,"" they wrote in a note.
*****
> Cowen analysts expect Amazon will see revenue growth of 19 percent, to $72.1 billion, driven by e commerce, web services and advertising.
*****
> The firm reiterated its outperform rating on the stock. ""We also forecast 4Q18 Operating Income (GAAP) to be ~14% above the high end of guidance, with ~17% incremental margins driven by AWS, the ramping high margin Ad biz and 3P mix shift,"" the Cowen analysts wrote. They also have a target of $2,250 on the stock.
*****
> Besides earnings in the coming week, the Fed meets Tuesday and Wednesday, but it is not expected to take any rate action. There is also the January employment report on Friday.

# Why Tom Terrific Might Not Be So Terrific For Stocks

> The Super Bowl indicator suggests that stocks rise for the full year when the Super Bowl winner comes from the original National Football League (now the NFC), but when an original American Football League (now the AFC) team wins, stocks fall. We would be the first to admit that this indicator has no connection to the stock market, but the data don’t lie—the S&P 500 Index has performed better, and posted positive gains with greater frequency, over the past 52 Super Bowl games when NFC teams have won. Of course, it’s worth noting that this didn’t work last year when the Eagles won the Super Bowl, and the S&P 500 lost 6.2% in 2018.

> A simpler way to look at the Super Bowl indicator is to look at the average gain for the S&P 500 when the NFC has won versus the AFC—and ignore the history of the franchises. This similar set of criteria has produced an average price return of 10.2% when an NFC team has won, compared with a return of 5.8% with an AFC winner. An NFC winner has produced a positive year 79% of the time, while the S&P 500 has been up only 63% of the time when the winner came from the AFC.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/What-SP-500-Index-does-for-the-year-depending-on-which-conference-wins.png?ssl=1))**

> Would you believe the numbers actually get worse when the Patriots are involved? That’s right—the S&P 500 has gained only 2.2% on average in years when the Patriots play in the big game. What about since Tom Brady has been the quarterback? The S&P 500 is down 3.0% on average! “Pats fans might be ecstatic that Tom Brady is starting in a record-breaking ninth Super Bowl, but market bulls don’t want to see the Pats win, as stocks are up only 1.5% for the year on average after a victory versus up 2.9% if they lose,” saidLPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Tom might be terrific, but maybe not in all markets.”

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/A-Super-Bowl-appearance-by-the-New-England-Patriots-has-not-historically-benefited-markets.png?ssl=1))**

> We would like to reiterate that we realize these calculations are in no way relevant to investors—but it sure is more fun to talk about the Super Bowl and stock market returns ahead of the biggest NFL game of the year than snowfalls and freezing temperatures. We hope everyone has a great Super Bowl Sunday and we wish both the Rams and Pats luck!

# Stocks Bounced, Now What?

> The big bounce off the December 24 lows continued last week, as the S&P 500 Index added 2.9% for the week. In fact, it has gained 2.9%, 1.9%, 2.5%, and 2.9% over the past four weeks for a total gain of 10.5%. Of course, the S&P 500 did have its worst December in 87 years and worst fourth quarter since the 2008-09 financial crisis, so stocks were historically oversold coming into 2019. Still, this bounce is quite impressive.

> Just what could this extreme strength be telling us? “Here’s the catch: Stocks have been up huge the past four weeks, but history also tells us that being up more than 1.5% for four consecutive weeks actually tends to see continued outperformance going out the next three months. Don’t fight the trend is another way to put it,” explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the S&P 500 tends to continue to outperform after similarly strong four-week stretches. Since 1950, after being up 1.5% or more for four consecutive weeks, the index’s average return going out 8 and 12 weeks has been more than double its overall average.

# Main Street’s Uncertainty Climbs

> Recent U.S. economic data have been sending a lot of conflicting signals, and Wall Street’s economic outlook is more clouded than at any point of the cycle. Because of this, we thought we’d provide some direction from Main Street via the latest Federal Reserve’s (Fed) Beige Book survey, which was published January 16 and compiled in the weeks before January 7.

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, Main Street is finding it more difficult to characterize current economic conditions and set expectations. While sentiment is still healthy, mentions of uncertainty in the Beige Book climbed to the highest in at least four years, while strong and weak words both declined.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Beige-Book-Mention-of-Uncertainty-Hit-Four-Year-High.png?ssl=1))**

> Respondents cited uncertainty around trade, politics, financial markets, and global economic conditions. Recently, this uncertainty has bled into economic data. Gauges of manufacturing activity, which are leading indicators for the U.S. economy, have slowed sharply as businesses delay expansion plans and capital investment while they wait for resolutions to the headwinds. To us, though, all the fundamental pieces are still in place for a continued expansion.

> “The growing uncertainty has been tough to ignore, but Main Street’s view of the economy remains relatively upbeat,” said LPL Research Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. “We still see a compelling argument for moderate economic growth due to strong consumer demand, modestly accelerating wages, and a robust labor market.”

> As mentioned in our Outlook 2019: FUNDAMENTAL: How to Focus on What Really Matters in the Markets, we expect U.S. gross domestic product growth of 2.5%–2.75% in 2019. Capital spending growth is an important part of our economic outlook (as it leads to increased productivity and contained labor costs), and we still expect business investment to increase this year. We see trade tensions as the primary roadblock to sentiment, and we expect the United States and China to reach a deal soon, eliminating a great deal of current uncertainty and allowing companies to resume their expansion plans.

# February Almanac: Small-Caps Tend to Outperform

> Even though February is right in the middle of the Best Six Months, its long-term track record, since 1950, is not all that stellar. February ranks no better than seventh and has posted paltry average gains except for the Russell 2000. Small cap stocks, benefiting from “January Effect” carry over; tend to outpace large cap stocks in February. The Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks turns in an average gain of 1.1% in February since 1979—just the seventh best month for that benchmark.

> In pre-election years, February’s performance generally improves with average returns all positive. NASDAQ performs best, gaining an average 2.8% in pre-election-year Februarys since 1971. Russell 2000 is second best, averaging gains of 2.5% since 1979. DJIA, S&P 500 and Russell 1000, the large-cap indices, tend to lag with average advances of around 1.0%.

# Pre-Election Years: Best Year of Four-Year Cycle

> Presidential elections every four years have a profound impact on the economy and the stock market. Wars, recessions and bear markets have tended to start or occur in the first half of the term while prosperous times and bull markets, in the latter half. This pattern has contributed to solid average gains in many pre-presidential-election years. Compared to the average performance of All Years, Pre-Election Years have enjoyed approximately twice the returns.

> In the following charts, Pre-Election Years, All Years and 2019 year-to-date are presented. After a bumpy start to this year, the market has shot higher off of December’s lows. As of yesterday’s close, DJIA was up 4.62%, S&P 500 5.03% and NASDAQ 5.8%. At this early stage of pre-election year 2019, this performance is comfortably above average. If economic growth can remain firm, the partial government shutdown comes to an end, the Fed isn’t overly hawkish with monetary policy and some reasonable resolution to the trade war can be reached, 2019 could live up to expectations.

MMM            CVX
XOM              IBM
DOW              PFE
WBA              KO
CSCO            VZ


Looking to buy 100 shares of one and write weekly 1-2% OTM specifically looking at the dogs.  As the profits from the calls will buy shares of the other dogs.  

Intent is to hold said company until it appears it may get booted out of the Dow 30 list.

Current DD: WBA personally get scripts filled there.  TA suggests it’ll go down to $50/$51 then rebound (May have hit yesterday).  Also have a 0 DTE $52 call.

MMM very low institutional ownership, makes me Leary that price will be move volatile than others.

VZ: I didn’t think ER looked bad have a 0 DTE $59.5 call

CVX: lotto 115 call 0 DTE 

CSCO: 0 DTE $47.5 call need to chart yet

PFE: Thinking it’s near it’s low and set to rebound to $40-$42. Holding a 0 DTE $37 call"

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 13th, 2020.

# **Trade deal and earnings season could shape the market’s next moves  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/10/trade-deal-and-earnings-season-could-shape-the-markets-next-moves.html)**
*****
> The stock market’s race to new highs could be put to the test in the coming week by two events — the signing of a phase one trade deal with China and the start of corporate earnings season.
*****
> Stocks have been gaining steadily since it became clear late last year that the U.S. and China reached a truce and would agree to a phase one deal, rolling back some tariffs and avoiding new ones. But details of that deal have never been made clear, so markets will be focused on any information that will clarify how it will be implemented and what checks and balances there are to ensure compliance.
*****
> The market has also reached a lofty premium that could be challenged if earnings disappoint, though analysts widely expect to see the majority of companies able to beat lowered expectations.
*****
> Banks are first up with J.P. Morgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo releasing earnings Tuesday, and Bank of America and Goldman Sachs reporting on Wednesday. Earnings could be a slight positive for the market, analysts say.
*****
> “I think earnings are going to be a good component,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. “Companies have lowered the bar enough to where I think most of the companies will easily step over it, and we’ll all have a sigh of relief that the earnings this quarter won’t be as bad as it could have been. It won’ be strong. We’ve seen revisions across all of the sectors come down.”
*****
> According to Refinitiv, fourth quarter earnings are expected to be down 0.6%, based on results of companies that have already reported and estimates for others that have not.
*****
> Stocks started out the past week worried about a blowup in the Middle East, after the U.S. killed Iran’s top general. But by midweek, tensions dissipated and stocks were higher. On Friday, stocks sold off again, after a lackluster jobs report, though the Dow briefly topped 29,000 for the first time. The S&P 500 was up 0.9% for the week, at 3,265, and the Dow was off 0.7% at 28,823.
*****
> The China trade deal is expected to be signed on Wednesday, and while it may be a nonevent, it has the potential for surprises. The deal most likely will be seen as a positive, but it is not expected to do much to curb technology transfers, which are expected to be part of the next phase discussions.
*****
> “If the deal is more watered down than anticipated, if there’s skepticism about how China will adhere to its promises” it could be negative, Arone said. “There’s skepticism already. If there’s something in the details that suggest doubt about how are we going to police this or how are we going to enforce this, I think that could cause markets to move some.”
*****
> Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Advisory Group said he thinks the market has moved past the trade news. “I think they’ll try to emphasize some IP protection. I honestly think people have already moved on,” he said. President Donald Trump has also lowered expectations by noting that the next phase of the deal would not come until after the election.
*****
># Economy
> Markets also will focus on some of the upcoming data in the week ahead, particularly CPI inflation data Tuesday and retail sales for December on Thursday.
*****
> Core CPI is expected to increase by 0.2%, putting the annual pace at 2.3%, and retail sales are expected to rise by 0.3%.
*****
> “The holiday season when all was said and done should have been pretty good. You had low gas prices, rising wages and a super tight labor market. It has to be good,” said Joseph LaVorgna, Natixis chief economist Americas.
*****
> There is also a parade of Fed speakers in the coming week, but they are unlikely to offer any clues about when the Fed will move off the sidelines. Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren, who voted against the Fed’s rate cuts three times last year, speaks Monday. There are a half dozen more appearances by other Fed officials, including Dallas Fed President Rob Kaplan, who speaks Wednesday.
*****
> LaVorgna said the Fed could begin to focus more on the rapid rise in the stock markets, as Kaplan did this past week. “It seems to me the hawks might worry about financial instability and the market being excessively exuberant,” said LaVorgna.

# January Expiration Week: Mixed Bag Last 21 Years

> Over the past thirty-seven years, since 1983, the S&P 500’s performance during January’s option expiration week has been a tepid. Friday has been up 21 and down 16, and the entire week has been down five-plus times for every four times it has been up. However, in the past twenty-one years (1999-2019), the S&P 500’s performance has taken a turn for the worse with expiration day falling ten times with an average loss of .08% and the full-week declining 14 times with an average loss of 0.74%. DJIA and NASDAQ have similar track records since 1999.

# 378 Days since Last 10% S&P 500 Correction & Still Counting

> There is little doubt that 2019 was a good year for the market. DJIA advanced 22.3%, S&P 500 climbed 28.9% and NASDAQ jumped 35.2% in 2019. Even for a pre-election year, those gains are above average. Gains of this magnitude also have a tendency to cause some uneasiness as valuations are generally getting stretched and thoughts turn to profit taking or the possibility of a pullback or a correction.

> S&P 500 completed its last correction (defined as a 10% or greater decline, but less than 20% because that would be a bear market then) on December 24, 2018 after falling 19.8%. That was 378 calendar days ago and it was the fifth correction of the current bull market that begun on March 9, 2009. Since 1948, the current bull market is the second longest in duration and magnitude. The longest was 4494 calendar days from December 4, 1987 through March 24, 2000. S&P 500 gained 582.1% during that bull while enduring five corrections. Even though it has been 378 days since the last does not mean one is imminent. S&P 500 has gone as along as 2553 calendar days without a correction before (October 1990 through October 1997).

# How Stocks Do During Geopolitical Events

> It was a volatile night for the U.S.-Iran conflict.

> S&P 500 Index futures dipped 1.5% and global markets swung after Iran shot several ballistic missiles at U.S.-Iraqi military bases. Markets recovered their losses overnight on news that there were no American casualties, but tensions remain high in the Middle East.

> As concerns over the Iran conflict continue to build, we’ve received many questions asking what this could mean for the market outlook. We discussed our initial thoughts regarding the conflict in our January 6 blog, but we believe it is important for investors to remember that there have been many times historically when stocks stood strong in times of conflict. In fact, the best ever annual Dow Jones Industrial Average gain was in 1915 during World War I.

> “No doubt worries over Iran have investors on edge,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Stocks could be volatile for a while, but the impact to stocks from geopolitical events historically has tended to be short-lived.”

> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the S&P 500 fell 5% on average in 20 major geopolitical events dating back to the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. However, the S&P 500 recovered those losses in fewer than 50 calendar days on average.

> A special thanks to Sam Stovall of CFRA for sharing the data below with LPL Research.

# Why The First Five Days Of 2020 Could Have Bulls Smiling

> The first five days of 2020 are in the books. Although the headlines have been quite scary, equities have picked up right where they left off last year. In fact, after the first five trading days of the new year, the S&SP 500 Index is up a respectable 0.65%.

> Jeffrey Hirsch of The Stock Trader’s Almanac follows and tracks many interesting seasonal patterns. One that we find very interesting states that how stocks perform the first five trading days of a new year could indicate how the full year will go. Now, we’ll be the first to admit no one should invest based only on this adage, but the results have been quite compelling.

> We did some research and found that when S&P 500 returns in the first five trading days of a new year have been higher, the full-year total return for the S&P 500 has been positive 80% of the time. Compare that to returns being up only 60% of the time when the first five days have been lower, and we have something that has our attention. What about big gains? Well, when those first five days have been up more than 2%, the full year return has been positive a very impressive 16 of 17 times! Only 2018 didn’t follow suit when the first five days were up 2% or more.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/do-the-first-5-days-of-a-new-year-matter.png?ssl=1))**

> “Should you ever invest for a full year purely because of the first five days? We would emphatically say no,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But put in context, this seemingly random bit of info does have a very impressive track record. It is only a small piece of the pie, but the good news is we still don’t see any major warning signs that this bull market is over just yet.”

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, when the S&P 500 has gained more than 0.65% the first five trading days of a new year—like 2020—the full year has finished in the green 31 out of 35 times, with a very solid 17.2% average annual return. Although we aren’t expecting gains quite that large in 2020, it does help support the case for the bull for at least the rest of this year.

# ""Take my crude, please""

> Crude oil is just about as popular or maybe even less popular than tobacco these days. Sure, there was a brief spike in prices following the US drone strike on Iranian general Soleimani last Thursday night, but ever since then, crude oil has done nothing but trade lower. Just the fact that crude only managed to rally 3% in the lead up to what many thought to be a full-blown war with Iran shows just how out of favor crude is. This isn't the first time crude hasn't been able to hold onto gains either. As noted earlier this week, besides the last week, there have been two other periods of heightened tensions between the US and Iran over the last year where one would have expected prices to rally, but instead they sold-off.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/011020-Crude-Chart.png))**

> When a stock consistently opens at one price and then closes lower than it opened, it's considered a negative as it signals that investors are selling into strength. Applying that logic to crude oil confirms just how out of favor it has become. This week alone, the daily closing price has been lower than its open on all five days. The chart below shows daily streaks where crude oil closed below its opening price going back to the start of 2009. While the current five-day streak isn't anything to write home about, we would note that even before this past week's tensions in the Middle East, in late September/early October there was a streak of 13 trading days where the commodity closed lower than it opened, and that was the longest losing streak since at least the early 1980s! Before that, there was another streak of 7 trading days in July. In other words, two of the five longest streaks since 2009 where crude oil closed below its open both occurred in the last six months.

# Dow 29,000?

> By posting this, we're probably jinxing it, but the DJIA is on the verge of topping another 1,000 point threshold less than two months after first topping 28,000. While the media makes a big deal of each of these thresholds, we would note that the road to 29,000 from 28,000 is only 3.4%. That's hardly a momentous move. Since Trump became President in January 2017, though, 29,000 would be the 10th 1,000-point threshold that the DJIA would cross under his watch.

> The table below lists the date that the DJIA first crossed each 1,000-point threshold throughout history. For each level, we also include the number of calendar days that elapsed between the first cross of that threshold and the prior one, how large a percentage gain that the 1000-point threshold represents versus the prior one, and then how many times the DJIA has crossed each threshold (on a closing basis) both to the upside and downside. One of the most notable aspects of the table in our view is that even though each threshold is a smaller percentage than the prior one, there have been so few crosses (above and below) of most of the thresholds since the Dow first crossed 19,000 after the 2016 election. 19,000 was only crossed once, and six of the other nine thresholds since then haven't been crossed more than ten times. That's indicative of a market that has been rallying and not looking back.

Im sorta gay and do about 50/50 equity/options. Stock in Ibm, vz, att, hal, and dkng to spice it up. Scooped those first 4 after the march low low, now i just watch and count the dividend peanuts

The other half is the fun stuff: options spreads on mgm, aal, evri, spxs, amd, spy, vxx, qqq. 

Im starting to avoid playing options on stocks. MMs got it too easy. ETFs i find much more success predicting general short-mid movements. 

HAL, SPY, and MGM have laid golden eggs

AAL is cursed, also i have dgly calls expiring tm and i think that is the most retarded trade ive ever made 

Whats in your wallet?"

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 26th, 2020.

# **There’s a big week ahead for the market with an earnings deluge, GDP data and stimulus negotiations  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/23/theres-a-big-week-ahead-for-the-market-with-an-earnings-deluge-gdp-data-and-stimulus-negotiations.html)**
*****
> About a third of the S&P 500 companies report earnings, including Apple and Microsoft, but uncertainty around stimulus and the presidential election could loom larger for markets in the week ahead.
*****
> There is also important economic data on the calendar, with a first look at third-quarter gross domestic product Thursday. After the second quarter’s shocking 31.4% decline following coronavirus shutdowns, the economy bounced back with growth of 32.5% expected in the third quarter, according to Refinitiv.
*****
> Nearly 170 companies report earnings in the coming week, with a diverse group of blue chips among them, including Boeing, Caterpillar, Honeywell, and Merck. There is also a big showing from large tech names. Microsoft reports Tuesday, and Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook all report in a small window just after the market close on Thursday.
*****
> “For some of these stocks that have run a long way, the bar for those stock to respond to good earnings is higher,” said Julian Emanuel, head of equities and derivative strategy at BTIG.
*****
> So far about 85% of S&P companies that have reported earnings beat estimates, about 20 percentage points more than the long term average. Companies have been reporting earnings more than 16% above estimates, and the expectation is that earnings overall will be down about 18%, based on actual results and forecasts, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.
*****
> The Dow Jones Industrial average fell 0.95% for the week, breaking a 3-week win streak as coronavirus fiscal negotiations dragged on and tech shares declined.
*****
> “We’ve offered compromises, the speaker on a number of issues is still dug in,” said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Friday. “If she wants to compromise, there will be a deal. But we’ve made lots of progress in lots of areas, but there’s still some significant areas that we’re working through.”
*****
> His comments knocked stocks down a bit midday Friday.
*****
> “It’s been a muted reaction to earnings overall,” said Leo Grohowski, chief investment officer at BNY Mellon Wealth Management. “So I’m disappointed, in a way, as a fundamentally focused chief investment officer, that the stimulus saga seems to be what it’s all about day in and day out, hour by hour. It’s the stimulus saga, the election looming and the Covid resurgence. Those three things have sort of made earnings a page four story.”
*****
> With a week to go before the Nov. 3 election, the market could be a bit more volatile, especially if the outcome looks increasingly less certain.
*****
> “The market is going to focus on the state of stimulus. It’s going to focus on whether the polls are tightening or widening with regard to the probability of having an unclear outcome, contested outcome or both,” said Emanuel.
*****
> Former vice president Joe Biden’s lead has narrowed slightly but he is still ahead in swing state polls.
*****
> “We are experiencing a little bit of the calm before the storm here. I do think we are going to get some 1%, 2% daily moves depending on the news...I think you could see a 3% to 5% down opening the following day [after the election] pretty easily,” said Grohowski. “I think the market has grown increasingly comfortable with a cleaner result, even if the cleaner result is an all blue result, which potentially would result in a higher tax regime.”
*****
> Strategists say the market began to focus more on the possibility of a Democratic sweep, where Democrats take the White House and Congress. That could mean a bigger stimulus package, and some strategists believe tax hikes would be delayed until the economy is on more solid ground.
*****
> “As we get closer to the election, we’re likely to see more volatility no matter what the outcome,” said Grohowski.
*****
> Emanuel said investors are not adequately hedged for an uncertain outcome. “Active managers have the most net long positions they’ve had in a number of years because they’re fearful of missing a year-end rally,” said Emanuel. “The options market in no way, shape or form is telling you people are hedged right here. The market is discounting a slight volatility, not expected to be persistent into year end.”
*****
Emanuel said the options market indicates investors do expect some volatility but not through year end, as some investors began hedging for several months ago.
*****
> “What we see by and large is again the bump in volatility. It’s really only anticipating a 2% or 3% move in the market either way, after the election, and then the expectation is to likely moderate after that,” Emanuel said.
*****
> The final trading day of October is on Friday, so there could also be some added volatility as fund managers readjust their portfolios between bonds and stocks. In the past week, Treasury yields broke out of a four-month range. The 10-year yield rose above 0.80% for the first time since June, and while it could move higher, strategists expect its move to be contained.

> # Nasdaq vs. Dow Outperformance

> You may not realize it, but while the Tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is up a ridiculous 28% so far in 2020, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is still in the red on the year.

> Below is a table showing the Dow and Nasdaq's annual percentage change since 1972 when the Nasdaq came into existence. Were the year to end now, the Nasdaq would be outperforming the Dow by 28.65 percentage points. This would be the third strongest outperformance for the Nasdaq on record and the strongest since 1999 when the spread was 60 percentage points!

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/dowavg.png))**
> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/downazpctchg.png))**
> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/spreaduse.png))**

> Below are all years since 1972 in which the Nasdaq outperformed the Dow by at least ten percentage points. The Nasdaq has posted an annual gain of 20%+ in seventeen different years, but never in a year when the Dow was in the red. Probably the year that most resembles 2020 in terms of the performance spread is 1979 when the Nasdaq rose 28.11% and the Dow rose just 4.19%. Following that year in 1980, both the Dow and Nasdaq surged again and the Nasdaq outperformed by another 18.9 percentage points.

> Interestingly, of the twelve years where the Nasdaq outperformed the Dow by more than ten percentage points, the Nasdaq went on to beat the Dow again in the next year eleven out of twelve times. The only time we've seen the Nasdaq crumble versus the Dow in the following year was in 2000 after 1999's outperformance. In 1999, the Nasdaq beat the Dow by a humongous 60 percentage points. After that large gap, though, the Nasdaq ran out of gas in 2000 and underperformed the Dow by 33 percentage points when the Dot Com Bubble finally burst.

> # Leading Indicators Show Slowing Pace of Economic Recovery

> The Federal Reserve’s (Fed) Beige Book presented qualitative data that suggested the pace of the economic recovery had been tapering, as we discussed in the LPL Research blog, Beige Book Shows Pace of Recovery is Moderating, but now we have quantitative data that is confirming the survey data. The Conference Board’s Leading Economic Index (LEI) increased 0.7% month over month in September to beat Bloomberg consensus expectations of 0.6%, but slowed after rising 1.4% in August and 2% in July.

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the leading indicators are still growing, but at a slower rate than the blistering pace seen in the initial months after emerging from lockdowns.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10.23.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> Growth in the LEI in September was primarily driven by the improvement in jobless claims, as well as continued strength in building permits for new private housing—a trend that matches the behavioral shifts to accommodate work from home conditions during the pandemic. The pullback in stock prices last month and manufacturers’ new orders were the lone detractors from the LEI in September.

> “It comes as no surprise that growth began to level off after the surge over the summer, and the softer LEI print is suggesting the economy could be losing momentum heading into the fourth quarter,” said LPL Chief Investment Officer Burt White. “However, despite the slowing momentum, we still expect solid economic growth in Q4, just not quite at the same rate in Q3.”

> The decline in manufacturers’ new orders is likely in relation to election uncertainty, which should prove transitory. However, the recent rise in COVID-19 cases in both Europe and the United States may cause business activity to slow, even if no additional lockdowns are mandated. As we head into the fourth quarter, we will continue to monitor real-time data for any additional clues about the pace of the economic recovery.

> # Halloween Trading Strategy: S&P 500 Up 85% of the Time

> Next week provides a special short-term seasonal opportunity, one of the most consistent of the year. The last 4 trading days of October and the first 3 trading days of November have a stellar record the last 26 years. From the tables above & below:

> * Dow up 77% of the time, 20 of last 26 years, average gain 2.05%.
> * S&P up 85% of the time, 22 of last 26 years, average gain 2.11%.
> * NASDAQ up 85% of the time, 22 of last 26 years, average gain 2.67%.
> * Russell 2000 up 77% of the time, 20 of last 26 years, average gain 2.31%.

> Many refer to our Best Six Months Tactical Seasonal Switching Strategy as the Halloween Indicator or Halloween Strategy and of course “Sell in May”. These catch phrases highlight our discovery that was first published in 1986 in the 1987 Stock Trader’s Almanac that most of the market’s gains have been made from October 31 to April 30, while the market tends to go sideways to down from May through October.

> Recent market weakness has held off our Seasonal MACD Buy Signal so far, but it could trigger anytime now. Uncertainty abounds with surging covid-19 cases, a heated presidential election and persistently elevated unemployment. However, each day that passes is one day closer to a covid-19 vaccine. Interest rates are low and ample liquidity is available to support the market and the economy. Additional fiscal stimulus also appears to be coming soon. Debate continues on the amount, but both parties do appear to agree it is needed in one form or another.

> # ""Quitters""

> Like an old pair of ""quitters"" that keep falling down because their elasticity is shot, the market has had its own trouble staying up over the last few trading days. Today isn't over yet, but if the S&P 500 finishes around current levels it will mark the fourth straight day of finishing down at least half of one percent from its intraday high. Compared to the three days before, today's pullback from an intraday high has actually been pretty mild up to this point. Following Monday's 2%+ decline from the intraday high shortly after the open, yesterday, the S&P 500 traded down close to 1% from its afternoon high. These two reversals followed Friday's late-day sell-off when the S&P 500 finished the day down 0.75% from its intraday high.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/102120-Last-Four-Days1.png))**

> While it's disheartening to see the market erasing early gains as the day goes on, it's helpful to put the last four trading days into perspective. Over the last 25 years, it hasn't been uncommon for the S&P 500 to finish the day down at least 0.5% from an intraday high for four days in a row. The current streak, if it holds, would be the 158th such streak of four or more days. That works out to more than six a year. There have also been a number of streaks that were much longer than the current one. In fact, it was only a month ago that the S&P 500 went 11 straight days of finishing the day down at least 0.5% from its intraday high, and besides that streak, there have been five other streaks that spanned ten or more trading days.

> # October Optimism For Homebuilders

> Given housing inventories remain historically low thanks to still strong demand, homebuilders have plenty to be optimistic about. The National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) has continued to show this strength as its monthly sentiment survey set a record high for the month of October. Back in August, the index tied the previous record level of 78 from December of 1998. Over the past two months, it has only raised that bar, coming in at 85 this month; 2 points above forecasts and last month's reading of 83.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101920-NAHB-1.png))**

> The rise in the index comes on broad strength across each of the sub-indices. Present Sales, Future Sales, and Traffic all matched or made record highs in October. The only sub-index that was not higher was for Traffic, though, it was unchanged at a record high.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101920-NAHB-Table1.png))**

> As for the look across each of the four US regions, the West and Northeast both saw sizeable upticks to new records, but sentiment in the Midwest and South were actually slightly lower. For the Northeast, this is the third record in a row. Meanwhile, the West's record high in October finally surpassed the prior high of 91 from October of 2005. Finally, even though sentiment fell in the Midwest and South, both remain at higher levels now than any month other than September's record highs.

# [Dow futures are slightly lower ahead of the Fed decision](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/02/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
>U.S. stock futures were muted in morning trading Wednesday as investors awaited a decision from the Federal Reserve on its move to start withdrawing the support it has been providing.
*****
>Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dipped 51 points. S&P 500 futures were about flat and Nasdaq 100 futures rose slightly. All three major averages closed at record highs on Tuesday.
*****
>Lyft jumped nearly 13% in after hours trading on better-than-expected third-quarter results. Zillow fell more than 11% after announcing it will close its home buying and flipping business. Shares of Bed Bath & Beyond rose on a partnership announcement with Kroger but the nearly 70% after hours surge that followed was likely fueled by a short squeeze.
*****
>Activision shares tumbled, falling nearly 12% after it said the launch of two games would be delayed. The company also issued a weaker holiday outlook thought it did beat profit estimates for the quarter.
*****
>Investors are focused on the Federal Reserve, which is expected to announce the timeline for a gradual reduction in its bond-buying program Wednesday at the conclusion of its two-day meeting. They’ll also be listening for clues on when the central bank plans to raise interest rates.
*****
>Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to stress that the reduction process known as tapering does not equate to tightening policy. Traders are pricing in a more aggressive path of interest rate hikes than the Fed is anticipating, so Powell may try to talk the market down.
*****
>However, the Fed also will have to show that it is not ignoring the rise in inflation that has taken price increases to their fastest in 30 years.
*****
>“With the S&P 500 up 13 days in the past 15 ahead of the Fed beginning the process of draining the punch bowl, there certainly is a lot of confidence that strong earnings will overcome everything,” said Peter Boockvar, Bleakley Advisory Group’s CIO. “That said, global monetary tightening is taking place, not just with the Fed, and that should not be ignored either.”
*****
>Equities rose Tuesday as companies continued to deliver strong earnings reports. Of the S&P 500 companies that have reported so far this earnings season, 83% of them have beat consensus expectations, according to FactSet. That’s despite ongoing supply chain disruptions, labor challenges, commodity inflation, central bank policy and Covid risk.
*****
>“Stocks are like the Energizer Bunny, as they continue to soar to new highs and show no signs of tiring,” said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist for LPL Financial. “We understand all of the worries out there, but the bottom line is earnings continue to come in way better than expected and are helping to justify stocks are current levels.”
*****
>In regular trading on Tuesday, the Dow rose 138.79 points to 36,052.63. The S&P 500 added 0.3% and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.3%. All three major averages closed at records for the third session in a row. The small cap Russell 2000 rose slightly and closed at an all-time high.
*****
>Those highs are making a potential year-end rally more conceivable to investors.
*****
>“The primary market trend appears higher,” said Keith Lerner, co-chief investment officer at Truist. “In the eight periods since 1950 where stocks were up more than 20% through October, as they are this year, the S&P 500 tacked on additional gains by year end 100% of the time with an average gain of 6.2%.”
*****
>Investors also will get a look at the jobs market when payrolls processing firm ADP releases its report on private employment at 8:15 a.m. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect the report to show that companies added 395,000 positions for October.

A pandemic is not going to suddenly get people to be interested in getting a netflix subscription, people will just do more of their usual hobbies like reading, painting, shitposting or whatever, it literally make 0 sense that netflix will get more than 100 subs out of this shit.

#[4 things to know before the stock market opens Friday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/15/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-friday-oct-15.html)

*****

> # 1. Wall Street on track for a winning week on strong earnings

> * Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rose more than 150 points Friday, one day after the 30-stock benchmark broke a four-session losing streak with a surge of 534 points, or nearly 1.6%. While the Dow on Thursday had its best day since July, the S&P 500′s 1.7% increase was its best day since March. The Nasdaq Composite rose more than 1.7% for its best day since May. The three stock benchmarks were headed for weekly gains. U.S. oil prices rose to a fresh seven-year high, topping $82 per barrel. The 10-year Treasury yield ticked higher to about 1.54%. Dow stock Goldman Sachs rose more than 1% in the premarket ahead the bank’s latest quarterly report. Bank earnings this week have been strong.

*****

> # 2. Retail sales out before the bell after this week’s hot inflation data

> * Following two key inflation reports this week that showed sticky price pressures on the wholesale and consumer levels, the government is set to report retail sales at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists polled by Dow Jones expect September headline retail sales to have dipped 0.2% after a 0.7% increase the prior month. Retail sales, excluding autos, are forecast to have risen by 0.5% compared with an August advance of 1.8%. The data will follow the release of the Federal Reserve’s September meeting minutes. According to minutes from its September meeting, the central bank could begin tapering its Covid-era bond purchases as soon as mid-November, as the economy recovers. The Fed’s next meeting is set for Nov. 2-3, with this year’s final meeting scheduled Dec. 14-15.

*****

> # 3. FDA panel to meet on J&J booster after recommending Moderna

> * The Food and Drug Administration’s vaccine advisory committee is set to meet Friday to consider a booster shot of Johnson & Johnson’s one-dose Covid vaccine and data on mixing and matching shots. The panel on Thursday unanimously recommended giving a booster of Moderna’s two-dose Covid vaccine to people 65 and older and other vulnerable adults. The nonbinding decision would bring guidelines for Moderna in line with a third shot of Pfizer’s vaccine. A final FDA decision on Moderna boosters could come within days after consideration from the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

*****

> # 4. Virgin Galactic sinks 20% after delaying commercial service

> * Virgin Galactic is delaying the launch of its commercial space tourism service until the fourth quarter of 2022. Shares of Richard Branson’s space company plunged 20% in the premarket. Virgin Galactic will start this month refurbishing and improving its spacecraft and carrier aircraft, rather than carry out its next spaceflight test. The company’s enhancement process, which is expected to take eight to 10 months, makes mid-2022 the earliest for the Unity 23 spaceflight. Last month, the Federal Aviation Administration cleared Virgin Galactic to return to flight after an investigation into the July spaceflight that carried Branson.

# [Stock futures are little changed as investors digest earnings results](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/19/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> U.S. stock index futures were little changed on Wednesday, after the S&P 500 on Tuesday posted its fifth straight winning session as strong earnings numbers lift sentiment.
*****
> Futures contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 7 points. S&P 500 futures were flat and Nasdaq 100 futures were about unchanged as well.
*****
> Fundstrat’s Tom Lee said the market could still rally more than 6% by the end of the year despite the “jagged year of progress” it’s had. He upped his S&P 500 price target 100 points to 4,800, citing current price rally, a signal of a strong risk-on environment, as well as declining Covid cases and economic resilience.
*****
> “We believe a strong risk-on environment is underway,” Lee said in a note to investors late Tuesday. “We do not think consensus is that bullish. We already know that investors got very pessimistic in September... However, the improvement in market technicals, such as clearing the 50-day moving average, is actually suggesting that underlying trends are getting stronger.”
*****
> Netflix posted its hotly-anticipated third-quarter earnings report on Tuesday after the market closed, with the streaming giant adding 4.4 million subscribers during the period. Wall Street analysts were expecting 3.84 million additions, according to estimates from StreetAccount. However, the shares, which are up 20% in the last three months, were down 2% in premarket trading.
*****
> Deutsche Bank downgraded Netflix after the report, saying its stock valuation was hard to justify with revenue growth set to slow next year. The firm also said strong fourth quarter subscriber additions are already baked into the stock.
*****
> United Airlines also posted quarterly results after the bell on Tuesday, with the company beating analyst expectations on the top and bottom line amid an ongoing rebound in travel demand. United shares were higher by about 2% in premarket trading.
*****
> Biogen shares rose 2% in early morning trading after reporting its quarterly results. The company beat analyst estimates on earnings and revenue and raised its full year guidance.
*****
> Ford shares up 2% in premarket trading after Credit Suisse upgraded the auto company on its EV shift and predicted a 30% rally in the stock.
*****
> More than 70 S&P 500 components report earnings this week. On Wednesday Verizon, Biogen and Canadian Pacific Railway are on deck before the opening bell. IBM, Tesla, CSX and Las Vegas Sands are among the names set to report after the market closes.
*****
> So far investors have largely cheered results from the batch of third-quarter earnings that have hit the market since the banks kicked things off last week. Of the S&P 500 components that have reported thus far, 82% have topped expectations, according to FactSet.
*****
> However, Jeff Buchbinder, equity strategist for LPL Financial, said investors shouldn’t expect the beats that companies posted as they emerged from the depths of the pandemic.
*****
> “We have used most of the superlatives we know to describe corporate America’s stunning performances over the past two earnings seasons,” he said. “We expect solid earnings gains during the upcoming third-quarter earnings season, but upside surprises will be smaller. Unfortunately, we won’t need as many superlatives.”
*****
> The Dow advanced nearly 200 points, or 0.56%, on Tuesday for its third positive session in the last four days. Johnson & Johnson had the most positive impact on the 30-stock benchmark, while Procter & Gamble was the largest drag.
*****
> The S&P 500 added 0.74%, while the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.71%. Both saw their fifth straight day of gains, the longest daily winning streak since late August.
*****
> With stocks’ Tuesday advance, the major averages are approaching their all-time highs. The Dow is 0.49% below its record, while the S&P and Nasdaq Composite sit 0.58% and 1.78% below their highwater marks.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

# **Stocks will likely hit new records in the week ahead if earnings keep topping expectations  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/19/stocks-go-for-all-time-highs-next-week-as-the-earnings-season-continues.html)**
*****
> Stocks will try in the week ahead to break the all-time highs set earlier in the year as a slew of S&P 500 companies get set to report.
*****
> The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average are both around 1% below their all-time highs while the Nasdaq Composite is about 2% away from its record. The indexes got a lift this after a big chunk of this week’s reporters posted better-than-expected results. They were also boosted by improving sentiment around Brexit and U.S.-China trade negotiations.
*****
> The all-time highs could be tested as about 120 S&P 500 companies, or around 24%, are scheduled to release their quarterly results in the week ahead. Some of those companies include Caterpillar and Boeing, both of which are expected to report Wednesday before the bell. Amazon, Intel, McDonald’s and Chipotle Mexican Grill are also on deck for the week.
*****
> “You’ve got the potential for a combination of things that drive us to new highs,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. “At the same time you’re getting better micro data in the earnings, you’re getting better news on the macro hurdles facing us.”
*****
> More than 14% of S&P 500 companies have reported through Friday, FactSet data shows. Of those companies, 81% posted earnings that beat analyst expectations.
*****
> J.P. Morgan Chase’s report on Tuesday sent the stock to an all-time high while Citigroup and Bank of America also got a boost from their earnings releases. Netflix, meanwhile, briefly rallied around 7% Thursday before ending the session up 2.5%. Morgan Stanley advanced 1.5% on earnings. Coca-Cola climbed more than 1% on Friday after releasing its quarterly numbers.
*****
> To be sure, the companies are being rated on a very low bar this earnings season. Analysts polled by FactSet expected third-quarter earnings to have fallen by 4.6%.
*****
> “Earnings can be a positive catalyst to the extent that expectations are pretty low,” said Dan Russo, chief market strategist at Chaikin Analytics. “The bar has been lowered to the point where companies can jump over it.”
*****
> But investors might have a harder time digesting the week’s reports.
*****
> Companies such as Caterpillar are heavily affected by the U.S.-China trade war given their exposure to overseas markets. Boeing and Intel also have overseas exposure. Meanwhile, reports from companies such as Amazon, McDonald’s and Chipotle will be heavily scrutinized as investors look for clues on how the consumer is doing.
*****
> “Trade frictions and the global economic slowdown have clearly affected 2019 earnings growth thus far,” Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said in a note. “The third-quarter earnings reporting season will likely confirm that those negatives continued to pour over into last quarter’s results.”
*****
> The good news for investors is recent trade talks appear to have yielded some progress. President Donald Trump announced Oct. 11 the U.S. and China had reached a “very substantial phase one” deal. Multiple reports this week said China wants additional talks before signing off on the first phase, but National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow said Thursday there is “a lot of momentum” to finalize the deal.
*****
> John Augustine, chief investment officer at Huntington Private Bank, said the “narrative” around trade had gotten “so one-sided to the negative side, there may be a better chance than not that a phase-one deal is signed.”
*****
> Meanwhile, preliminary figures on consumer sentiment showed a slight increase in October from September. The final consumer sentiment numbers for the month are scheduled for release on Friday.
*****
> “If corporate earnings show signs of resilience, especially by the U.S. consumer, then a run to new highs is by no means out of the question,” Tom Essaye, founder of The Sevens Report, said in a note.

# The Calendar Could Have Bulls Smiling

> “History doesn’t repeat itself, but it often rhymes.” — Mark Twain

> Stocks have continued their surprising strength in October, thanks to a potential thaw in the U.S.-China trade dispute. And remember, the S&P 500 Index has been lower in October during a pre-election year only once since 1987. Additionally, over the past 20 years, October has been the third-best month on average for the S&P 500. October has had a bad rap due to some spectacular crashes, but the truth is the month usually is pretty good for stocks.

> “The calendar could be about to turn into a bull’s best friend, as late October has been when stocks historically started their end-of-year rally,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “No two years are ever the same, and we all remember last year’s sell-off. However, a better than expected earnings season, coupled with positive steps on trade and one more Federal Reserve rate cut this year could allow bulls to smile the rest of 2019.”

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, we are very near the historically strong end of year for equities. Whether you look at the average year or a pre-election year, stocks have tended to deliver an upward bias starting soon.

# Buy in October, and Get Yourself Sober

> Folks have become fixated with “Sell In May” but forget to “Buy in October, and Get Yourself Sober.” Our Best Six Months MACD Buy Signal that triggered last Friday, October 11th, initially appears to be timely. Friday’s Alert detailed several trades that were deployed Monday and updated in a follow up Alert on Monday. In addition to the Seasonal Sector ETF trades and the Tactical Seasonal Switching Strategy Portfolio trades in DIA, SPY, QQQ and IWM we released a New October Stock Basket yesterday!

> As you can see in the chart below of the S&P 500 the MACD “Buy” indicator trigger in the lower pane, highlighted in the yellow box with the black arrow, came in strong below the zero line. In the upper pane resistance at 3010 still persists. Aside from this resistance technically things look encouraging. We held support last August above 2815 and have been making higher lows since then, riding the 200-day moving average higher. The 50-day moving average has also constructively turned higher.

> As we have been monitoring all year, seasonal patterns for the Pre-Election remain on track, though the October dip came early. Save some truly negative news, the low for the year is likely in. With the market tracking this seasonal pattern so closely all year that suggests the pattern is likely to continue, which means some backing and filing around S&P 3000 through late November before additional new highs toward yearend.

# Bonds Bounce Back In Fund Flows Data

> The week ended October 9th saw relatively large inflows into bond funds and relatively large outflows from equity funds. Across all mutual and exchange traded funds, equity flows were in the 7th percentile of all readings since 2013, with outflows of $11.5bn. Of that total, $5.8bn was ETFs, with the lion’s share of equity fund outflows coming from domestic funds. As has so frequently been the case lately, bond funds were the exact opposite situation. Total bond fund flows across mutual funds and ETFs meant $5.8bn of new cash on the week, which is in the 64th percentile of all periods. ETFs were relatively stronger, with bond funds drawing $1.9bn of inflows, higher than more than 81% of periods since 2013. Within both ETF and combined mutual and ETF flows, municipal bonds were the standouts, with total flows in the top 10% of all periods. Since 2013, $152bn has flowed into mutual funds and ETFs that own municipal government bonds, with more than $90bn of that coming since the end of 2017. Those flows are very likely being driven by tax-advantaged buying incentivized by the changes to the tax code at the end of 2017 which ended a variety of popular state and local tax deductions.

# ISM Offsides, If Not Utterly Incorrect

> This week’s manufacturing activity releases from the New York Fed and Philly Fed showed a slightly weaker but generally upbeat assessment of economic activity. The numbers from these two regional surveys may not be fully representative of the aggregate national economy, but they’re usually a pretty good indicator. As shown in the chart below, they’ve been a decent guide to what the ISM Manufacturing index says about national activity since the Empire State manufacturing index started its releases in 2001.

> Unlike these two indices, which have shown a general uptick in activity over the last few months, the ISM index shows a different route. But that data isn’t backed up by the average results across the five Fed districts that survey their manufacturers. The size and scale of the divergence is so big that one of these indices is almost certainly wrong, but which?

> For a tiebreaker, Markit’s manufacturing survey suggests conditions are at multi-month highs and picking up, more consistent with the data from Fed surveys than ISM. Markit’s sample size is bigger and the index is more representative of the whole sector than ISM only; with all five regional Fed surveys in the mix, they also have a sample size advantage over ISM. Hard data of late (including manufacturing production, exports, and hiring) has all sided against ISM and is showing data more consistent with the Five Fed or Markit surveys. For now, it looks like the brutal ISM results are a bit overstated.

# Nasadaq - One Downtrend Down, Another To Go

> In a post yesterday, we discussed the seemingly never-ending rangebound trading pattern for the STOXX 600. It's not just Europe either. Seemingly everywhere you look these days, there's a major equity index stuck in some sort of range. The Nasdaq is just one example of many. At a level of around 8,140, the Nasdaq is at the same level it was at exactly six months ago and also all the way back in August of last year.

> Last week at this time, things were looking good for the Nasdaq as the index had bounced off of support at its 200-DMA and broke its short-term downtrend from the September lower high. This week has seen further gains with the Nasdaq rising more than 1%, but that rally looks to have stalled out yesterday right at another downtrend from the July high. A meaningful break of that downtrend would come into play at around 8,200 which is just over half of one percent above current levels. Using our Trend Analyzer tool, of the 100 stocks in the Nasdaq 100, heading into today, 43 were overbought and just five were oversold, so it may take a few days of 'rest' for the index before a meaningful break of that downtrend can occur.

# Rangebound on Both Sides of the Atlantic

> Everyone here is well aware of the fact that equities have been stuck in what seems like an endless trading range where the S&P 500 has failed to break out meaningfully to new highs. What some investors may not be of cognizant of is the fact that over in Europe, the benchmark STOXX 600 has also been stuck in a trading range of its own. While the index peaked at higher levels in 2015, it subsequently fell over 25% during the global sell-off in late 2015/early 2016. From those lows, the STOXX rallied more than 30% for the next 15 months. Since May 2017, though, the index has been stuck in a range and unable to meaningfully break out to new highs.

> This year's performance for the STOXX 600 has been a continuation of the holding pattern that the index has been stuck in since 2017. Earlier today, it looked as though we were getting close to a breakout as the index hit a 52-week high, but late in the European session equities sold-off nearly 1% from the intraday highs finishing near the lows of the day. Oh well. Maybe tomorrow.

> What bulls in Europe are hoping is that today's late-day sell-off isn't a repeat of what happened on July 25th. Back then, we saw a similar-looking breakout, but like today, the gains didn't hold and the STOXX 600 reversed over 1% and finished near the lows of the day. From the high on the day of that failed breakout in late July to the August lows, the STOXX 600 went on to fall nearly 9%.

# S&P 500 Sector Valuations

> The S&P 500's trailing 12-month P/E ratio has ticked up to 19.62 recently, which is close to its highest level of the past year. For valuations to stop expanding on any breakout higher for the S&P, we'll need to see earnings (the ""E"" in P/E) keep up with price. That's going to be a tough ask for corporate America this quarter, so we may be heading into 2020 with valuations at more concerning levels.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/spxpe.png))**

> Below are one-year charts of P/E ratios for ten S&P 500 sectors. These charts are included in our weekly Sector Snapshot report sent to Bespoke Premium members. Consumer Discretionary has the highest P/E ratio at 24.15 followed by Technology at 23.38. Tech's P/E has really jumped a lot recently to new 52-week highs. The Financial sector has the lowest P/E of the major sectors at just 13.27.

# Open Season For Small Caps

> There’s been chatter for many moons about the under performance of small cap stocks recently. True they have been under performing since the Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks hit its all-time high close over a year ago on August 31, 2018. However, the trend of under performance tracks the historical small cap seasonality quite well.

> With the Russell 2000 up a fraction today as the major U.S. large indices were down a bit from our historical seasonal pattern perspective this looks like the beginning of the bottom of small cap under performance and the beginning of the new “Small Effect.”

> As you can see in the accompanying chart the R2K has been tracking the pattern quite well since July and looks like the small fry are coming out of hibernation just in time for small cap stock hunting season.

> See page 110 of the Stock Trader’s Almanac 2019 and page 112 of the soon-to-be released 2020 edition for deep background.

# October Back on Track – Earnings Season Ramps Up

> After a bumpy start, the market is back on track at the mid-point of October. DJIA, S&P 500, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 are slightly above average at this point in the month compared to the last 21-year historical average. NASDAQ is comfortably above average and continues to lead. Negative headlines have given way to more upbeat news. Trade headlines are now featuring some progress even though tariffs remain in place and third quarter earnings season is underway with a solid report from JPMorgan Chase (JPM) today. Provided economic data and corporate earnings hold up, the market is likely to continue its run toward all-time highs and October could end with above average gains.

Seems more and more bears are getting recruited every day not only in the mainstream media, but even in this mentally-degenerative subreddit.

I'm firing all next week in just as the second wave is peaking. I believe that 401k re-balancing came to meet the second wave of rona this week and spooked the market. We've already had a reasonable correction, and states have made adjustments. 2nd wave is baked in. We've got trillions in the economy ready to fire and bonds and CDs won't even beat inflation, the market is the only place to be for natty gains.

We could get stim pack 2.0, vaccine news, police reform, infrastructure deal, and better reopening numbers from states that did it right, all within the next 2 weeks. Market is dying for good news. Bulls don't flake on me now, if you bought the panic dip in March you caked it. There's a whole lotta fish out there who are awfully scared to have exposure, and they're gonna miss out. Needless to say fading whatever moves the public makes is usually a good call, and there's no reason that should change now.

$VFC hammer buy - great value and only premo brands

$VZ hammer buy and paid to wait - 5G future

$PLNHF play weed de-listing & reopening - holding to $100

$CAKE hammer buy - flip to $40 and sell

# **After virus scare, markets look to Fed rate policy to keep stock rally going  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/24/after-virus-scare-markets-look-to-fed-rate-policy-to-keep-rally-going.html)**
*****
> With stocks coming off their first losing week of the year, investors will be looking for the Federal Reserve to soothe markets by reaffirming its position that interest rates will be low for a long time into the future.
*****
> The outbreak of the coronavirus in China in the past week took the steam out of a market that has been repeatedly rallying to new highs since December. The S&P 500 fell just about 1% for the week, amid fears the virus could lead to slower growth not only in China, but across the globe.
*****
> Those concerns could continue to spook markets in the coming week, but stocks should be buffeted by the Fed’s anticipated commitment to low rates and its current Treasury bill buying program. The Fed meets Tuesday and Wednesday. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to emphasize that the Fed remains on a neutral policy path and that would only change if there was a significant change in the economic outlook.
*****
> There are also some major earnings reports, including from Apple, which hit an all-time high Friday morning before closing lower with the broader market. It could have a big impact on sentiment and help influence trading across the technology sector.
*****
> Stocks were choppy in the past week, and Treasury yields have been sinking on worries about the new virus. The 10-year yield sunk to a Nov. 1 low of 1.68% and investors drove gold prices higher in a flight-to-safety trade.
*****
> “It’s overshadowing everything, and what the market is looking for is that the Chinese are containing it, and the spread is minimal,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. “The derivative of all of this is what does it do to growth? Traders and investors are hoping the stimulus that has been introduced into the Chinese economy is going to take hold, and this is not going to halt that turnaround.”
*****
> Krosby said the market has been looking for an excuse to pull back. The S&P 500 ended the week at 3,295, off 1%, but it is still up about 2% for the year so far.
*****
> “You could see going into the weekend the 10-year Treasury yield is down, gold is higher, the market is in a text book defensive state,” said Krosby. “We had a market that was poised for a bout of profit-taking and this is it.”
*****
> # Earnings roll out
> There are more than 135 S&P companies reporting earnings in the week ahead, with a heavy focus on technology, industrials and consumer stocks. Apple reports Tuesday, and Microsoft and Facebook are Wednesday. Boeing and General Electric report Wednesday, while McDonald’s releases results Wednesday. On Friday, big oil reports with ExxonMobil and Chevron expected.
*****
> Earnings reports so far have been mostly better than expected, with 68.2% of companies beating earnings per share estimates, according to Refinitiv. Earnings are expected to be down about a half percent for the fourth quarter, based on actual reports and estimates of companies yet to report.
*****
> “Coming into any earnings season with stocks at all time highs is fraught with peril,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. “It’s precarious because you have the opportunity for outsized moves if you miss earnings, revenues or guidance.”
*****
> Hogan said companies may be able to give a better indication of the future, now that there’s a first phase trade deal between the U.S. and China. He said markets will also be looking for guidance from China and elsewhere on whether the virus appears to be containable or not.
*****
>#  Fed is big story but won’t say much
The Federal Reserve is not likely to say much has changed in its outlook, except that it’s last three interest rate cuts may have helped the economy and financial conditions.
*****
> “The big news is just talk on the balance sheet. I think that’s going to be the key messaging,” said Jim Caron, portfolio strategist at Morgan Stanley Investment Management. “I think the data has been okay. There’s really nothing new there. The only thing that’s really new or interesting is going to be what’s going on with the balance sheet.”
*****
> The Fed has been buying about $60 billion in Treasury bills each month to expand its balance sheet, ending a program where it was shrinking the balance sheet. The Fed is adding reserves to end a problem in the repo market, which is basically the plumbing of the financial markets where institutions go to get short term cash.
*****
> Many traders believe the program is adding liquidity to markets, and therefore driving investors into stocks.
*****
> Mark Cabana, head of short rate strategy at BofA Securiteis, said the Fed is not changing its benchmark fed funds target rate, but the fixed income market has been expecting the Fed to make a technical adjustment to another rate. He said the fed funds rate, trading at about 1.55%, has come to the lower end of the Fed’s target range of 1.5 to 1.75%.
*****
> For that reason it is likely to raise the interest rate on excess reserves by five basis points. “The intent is to affirm the bottom end of the Fed’s target range, ” he said.
*****
> Besides the technical move, they “may be will provide a little more guidance on what it would take to vote rates one way or the other,” he said.
*****
> # Economic data
> There’s an important data calendar in the coming week, including the first look at the fourth quarter’s gross domestic product on Thursday. Personal income and spending data is Friday, and that includes the personal consumption expenditure inflation deflator, watched by the Fed.
*****
> New home sales could continue the string of positive news in housing, when they are released Monday, and there are durable goods Tuesday.

# February Almanac: Weak Link in Best Six Months

> Even though February is right in the middle of the Best Six Months, its long-term track record, since 1950, is rather tepid. February ranks no better than sixth and has posted meager average gains except for the Russell 2000. Small cap stocks, benefiting from “January Effect” carry over; tend to outpace large cap stocks in February. The Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks turns in an average gain of 1.2% in February since 1979—just the sixth best month for that benchmark.

> A strong February in 2000 boosts NASDAQ and Russell 2000 rankings in election years. Otherwise, February’s performance, compared to other presidential-election-year months, is mediocre at best with no large-cap index ranked better than seventh (DJIA and S&P 500 since 1950, Russell 1000 since 1979).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9e34d983528dd8ba9318507afe5ab487/adc248f00c22c241-e9/s400x600/89582e679e67bdacb47f14034f5988f808a89164.jpg))**

# Solid January Starts Not Rare, February Could Be Tepid

> Bullish sentiment is running high and why not. A new decade has begun, January has been bucking the recent trend of volatile performance and the market is trading at or near all-time record highs. Big round numbers like 29000, 3300 and 9000 are also emotionally satisfying. Our Santa Claus Rally and First Five Days indicators were both positive and the market is well on its way to completing a historically bullish January Trifecta. A positive January Barometer is all that remains to complete the January Trifecta.

> As of yesterday’s close DJIA was up 2.3% year-to-date. S&P 500 was up 2.79% and NASDAQ stood at 4.44%. Although these gains are above average, they are actually not all that uncommon by the thirteenth trading day of the New Year. Since 1901 (119 years), DJIA has been up 2.3% or more on the thirteenth trading day 33 times before this year. DJIA’s largest gain on the thirteenth trading day was 11.4% in 1976 (+17.9% for the full-year). S&P 500 has equaled or exceeded 2.79% on the thirteenth trading day 26 times since 1930 while NASDAQ has bested 4.44% 15 times since 1971. Depending on index, gains equal to or greater than this year come about approximately once every 3.3 to 3.6 years. 2012 was the last election year where all three indexes were up more on the thirteenth trading day than this year.

> In the following Seasonal Patten Charts of DJIA, S&P 500 and NASDAQ, we compare 2020 (as of yesterday’s close) to All Years and Election Years. Here it is clear that the market has gotten off to a solid start with well above average gains so far. Throughout 2019, the market tracked its historical patterns quite closely which suggests some mean reversion could occur this February as the month has been historically tepid for DJIA and S&P 500.

# Another Look At Election Years

> Last week in our LPL Research blog, we took a closer look at how stocks have performed during an election year. We found that since 1940, the S&P 500 Index hasn’t been lower during an election year when an incumbent president has been up for reelection.

> We’ve had many requests to look more into election years, so we thought we’d take another look at this impactful year.

> The S&P 500’s track record for reelection years has been impressive, but its average path during these years has been quite interesting, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day. In ten reelection years since 1950, the S&P 500 on average has barely budged from February through June, before breaking out in the second half of the year.

> “Stocks actually have traded in a tight range from February through June during election years, with the big rally taking place during the second half of the year,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/reelection-012220.jpg?ssl=1))**

> From a quarterly view, the S&P 500 has historically posted modest returns in the four quarters of an election year, but the benchmark has been higher an impressive 82% of the time in the fourth quarter of all election years. That’s one of the best track records of any quarter in the four-year presidential cycle.

# Recession Watch Update

> As the economic expansion caps its first decade, we thought it’d be a good time to check on LPL Research’s leading indicators in our Recession Watch Dashboard.

> As you can see in our latest update and in the LPL Chart of the Day, the overall view hasn’t changed much. We believe we are in the later stages of this economic expansion, but we still see little threat of imminent recession. The current expansion is the longest on record, at 126 months, but the economy has grown at a slow and steady rate. We believe this measured pace, along with supportive fiscal policy, has contributed to this cycle’s continued durability.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/012120-recession-blog.png?ssl=1))**

> In the fourth quarter, the needle moved in different directions for two of our five forecasters:

> We removed the U.S. Treasury Yield Curve from On Watch status as the spread between the 3-month and 10-year yields moved back into positive territory. The spread between the 2-year and 10-year yields also climbed to an 18-month high following the Federal Reserve rate cuts. Going back to 1955, a yield curve inversion (long-term yields falling below short-term yields) has preceded each of the nine recessions. It’s important to note, however, that parts of the curve flickered between positive and inverted territory several times before the actual recession occurred.

> We added Market Valuations to On Watch status, as the S&P 500 Index trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio rose near cycle highs. The P/E ratio is now comfortably above our 2020 target of 18.75. With the S&P 500 surpassing the upper end of our year-end fair value target of 3,300, we are watching closely to see if earnings growth is strong enough to justify these elevated valuations. The low interest-rate and inflation environment continue to be strong tailwinds for market valuations.

> “We remain optimistic of continued, albeit possibly slower, economic growth in the United States in the coming year, bolstered by recent progress on the U.S.-China trade deal,” said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. “While we continue to monitor the indicators closely, at the present time, we see only a modest chance of recession starting within the next year.”

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/wallstreetbets."
Can someone explain,16,82jkma,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/82jkma/can_someone_explain/,30,2018-03-07 04:43:33,How does Gary Cohns resignation affect the stock market? Why does an event like this cause people to sell off U.S stocks?

--------------------------------------------------------------

Apple Inc. $AAPL-


said its quarterly profit fell 27%. Revenue fell for a second straight quarter, along with sales of its flagship smartphone.


While the company reported strong sales of the smaller iPhone SE launched in March, overall its current models have failed to meet the booming sales of its first batch of large-screen iPhones, sapped in part by cooling demand in China and U.S. customers holding on to handsets for longer because of changes in carrier contracts.


The results, and Apple’s expectations for the current quarter ending September, were better than what Wall Street feared, and the stock rose more than 6% in after-hours trading. 


A bright spot was Apple’s revenue for services, including subscriptions to Apple Music, fees from Apple Pay and sales of apps. The company said services revenue rose 19% to $5.98 billion.
While iPad revenue increased 7% because of its pricier iPad Pro, unit sales fell for a 10th-straight quarter, down 9% to 9.95 million.
Sales of Mac computers fell 11%, marking a third-straight quarter of decline.

Apple shipped: 

-40.4M iPhones

-10M iPads 

-4.3M Macs 

-gave strong guidance for FQ4

-Tim Cook also expects services to be ""the size of a Fortune 100 company by next year,"" with major growth in the App Store, Apple Music and the iCloud.

-------------------------------------------------------------------


Twitter inc. $TWTR - 


fell short of expectations with a $107 million net loss on $602 million in sales. At a 20% gain year-over-year, this is Twitter’s slowest quarter of revenue growth since it went public. Shares dropped by 10% in after-hours trading. Investors were forecasting $682 million in sales for the third quarter.


Twitter's user base increased about 1 percent to 313 million average monthly active users in the second quarter from 310 million in the first quarter.


Earlier this year, Twitter laid out a long-term strategy to turn around its business, focusing on five areas: its core service, live-streaming video, the site's ""creators and influencers,"" safety and developers.

-------------------------------------------------------------------


The Coca-Cola Co. $KO -


released its Q2 earnings results on Wednesday morning. Revenues came in below Wall Street consensus expectations. 


Coke said it earned 60 cents a share, outpacing analysts' estimates of 58 cents a share, but revenue fell 5 percent, coming in at $11.54 billion in the latest quarter, shy of Wall Street's expectations, which called for $11.6 billion, on average. Second-quarter sales fell in each of Coke's regional units, except in North America.


Coca-Cola, PepsiCo Inc. and Dr Pepper Snapple Group have faced declining sales volumes as consumers turn to healthier alternatives. To combat the long-term decline in soda consumption, Coca-Cola has broadened its portfolio of products. The company took a stake in L.A. Aloe LLC, an aloe water-maker, last month. It also invested in Suja Life LLC, an organic-juice maker, in August, with an option to buy the balance of the company after three years. Coca-Cola previously bought a stake in energy-drink maker Monster Beverage Corp. and Keurig Green Mountain Inc.


-Some governments are turning against soda, too. Last month,Philadelphia became the first major U.S. city to pass a tax on diet and sugar-added beverages. 

-The United Kingdom is introducing a sugar tax in 2018.

-Coca-Cola has spent almost $50m in the last four years on research to develop new lower and no sugar drinks.

----------------------------------------------------------------


Comcast Corporation. $CMCSA-


second quarter was stronger than Wall Street had expected as the company narrowed the loss of video subscribers and revenue took off. For the period ended June 30, Comcast Corp. earned $2.03 billion, or 83 cents per share. A year earlier the Philadelphia company earned $2.14 billion, or 84 cents per share.


Comcast lost 4,000 video customers, which was the best second-quarter number in more than a decade, according to the company. 

At the same time, the company booked an increase in residential high-speed internet customers and small business customers. It added 220,000 high-speed internet customers in the period, the best performance for the quarter in eight years.


-------------------------------------------------------------------


T- Mobile US. $TMUS -


T-Mobile on Wednesday said Q2 revenue rose nearly 13% to $9.2 billion as it added 646,000 postpaid phone subscribers -- topping the 173,000 added by Sprint (S) and the 86,000 added by Verizon Communications (VZ). AT&T lost 160,000 postpaid phone subscribers.


T-Mobile reported earnings of 25 cents per share vs what Wall Street was looking for 20 cents per share. 
Revenue of $9.22 billion for the period, beating estimates of $9.03 billion. In the second quarter T-Mobile added 1.9 million net new customers.

It accomplished this feat by giving away company stock, movies, car rides and pizza. To help it compete against wireless behemoths AT&T and VerizonWireless, T-Mobile forged partnerships with ride-hailing service Lyft and Domino’s Pizza to woo potential new customers with vouchers for free rides and free pizza. The company also promoted giveaways of T-Mobile stock.

T-Mobile raised its year outlook for adding branded postpaid customers to a range of 3.4 million to 3.8 million, up from the prior range of 3.2 million to 3.6 million.

It now sees Ebitda of $9.8 billion to $10.1 billion, a narrowing of the prior range of $9.7 billion to $10.2 billion.

Companies with high debt that stay liquid will be biggest winners,17,hmo8a9,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hmo8a9/companies_with_high_debt_that_stay_liquid_will_be/,15,2020-07-07 10:36:28,"The current policy of QE (brrrrrrrrr) according to most economic theories would mean that inflation will eventually happen, but will likely be delayed until the economy begins to reopen and spending recovers. 

To avoid crowding out non-government debt, the Fed has stepped into risky bond markets and started buying those bonds to increase liquidity, this has some effect of delaying inflation but that balance sheet will unwind slowly.

Anyway, if we assume that inflation will rise at a higher level that we saw in the last few years, the real winners will be people and companies with huge amounts of debt that are able to maintain enough cash flow to pay those obligations.  Their debts will be eroded by inflation, and taking on enormous amounts of debt will likely result in windfall profits assuming what they financed with debt appreciates at the same level of inflation (think share buy backs).

""the proportion of buybacks funded by corporate bonds reached as high as 30% in both 2016 and 2017, "".[1]. So, by taking out loans to buy stock, which will keep pace with inflation, the companies that have participated in this behavior will stand to make huge returns, at the expense of the debt holders (at this point the fed and anyone with a savings account). 

So, what are some companies that stand to benefit from this?  Any company with a huge amount of debt, little cash on hand, a large number of repurchased shares, and a strong enough business model to not default on debt. 

These are the stocks I think would fall into that category.  It's important to note that companies like MSFT and APPL sitting on mountains of cash may be forced into share buybacks to avoid inflation, thus further driving up their stock prices as well.

United Parcel Service (UPS)
Charter Communications (CHTR)

Verizon Communications (VZ)

Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)

Oracle Corp. (ORCL)

IBM Corp. (IBM)

Ford Motor Co. (F)

I'd be interested what your thoughts are? 

Tldr; inflation goes up. Companies with debt that don't default will be rewarded. Companies that might default probably bailed out and rewarded also. Companies with lots of cash will have their value eroded. Calls.

Bulls on Parade! Pretty lines on a chart that show we’re still going UP UP UP!!,43,jx8wsv,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jx8wsv/bulls_on_parade_pretty_lines_on_a_chart_that_show/,9,2020-11-20 00:33:04,"Good news everybody! The market has experienced two Browning Slopes since mid-September. 

**The Fuck’s a Browning Slope?**

A Browning Slope is a nerdy complicated math thing that I won’t explain because you don’t actually care and won’t understand it anyway. What matters, and what you should care about, is that when these typically innocuous events are followed by a few sideways or slightly red weeks (what I call a “Slight Slide”) they start to indicate the market is setting up a pretty damn bullish scenario. 

When we see *two* of these Browning Slope + Slight Slide cycles *within a 3 month window* they are almost *always* followed by a nice solid growth period lasting a few months. How can I be so sure? Well, guess what dingus? IT ALREADY HAPPENED ONCE THIS YEAR. After the 'Rona crash we saw two of these cycles and the July/August rally came right after. I drew a picture for those of you who ate the scratch n sniff books as a kid:

[\(Insert random \\""this is not investment advice\\"" disclaimer here.\)](https://preview.redd.it/szxv21crt8061.jpg?width=1276&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bdd6c5f1e2aa39461d60486693a0d640b24573e9)

**What does it mean for me today?**  
It means we are currently 3/4 of the way through the setup to a bull’s dream. If another Slight Slide happens, we should be on the train to Tendie Town. Now, if you’ve made it this far you might have actually done a little bit of your own research and Googled “Browning Slope” and realized it’s just that: BS. I made it up. Anyone can draw red and green lines connecting candles and claim it’s a crystal ball. But it’s not. It’s a bunch of horse shit. These people are predicting all sort of events and they’ll *eventually* be right but like my deaf uncle says “Even a blind squirrel nuts every once in a while.” The truth is that no one really knows what is going to happen next until it's already happening. And anyone claiming they do is usually trying to sell you something, like VZ FDs.

The Nasdaq, as of Monday’s close, was almost 7.3% away from its latest record close Sept. 7, inching nearer to a correction. The S&P 500 was 5.2% from its Sept. 2 record high.

> # 2. U.S. faces recession if Congress doesn’t act on debt limit , Yellen says

> * Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told CNBC on Tuesday she believes the economy would fall into a recession if Congress fails to address the borrowing limit before an unprecedented default on the U.S. debt. “I do regard Oct. 18 as a deadline. It would be catastrophic to not pay the government’s bills, for us to be in a position where we lacked the resources to pay the government’s bills,” Yellen said on “Squawk Box.” On Monday, President Joe Biden urged Republican senators to “get out of the way” on the debt ceiling. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell has said Democrats should use their majorities on Capitol Hill to act without GOP votes.

> # 3. Oil prices rose to around 7-year highs after OPEC, allies moves

> * U.S. oil prices, as measured by West Texas Intermediate crude, rose modestly Tuesday morning to around seven-year highs near $78 per barrel. WTI jumped roughly 2.3% on Monday as international oil producers decided to keep a cap on supplies. Despite pressure from the U.S. to ramp up output, OPEC and its allies were concerned that a fourth global wave of Covid infections could slow a demand recovery, a source told Reuters just before Monday’s vote. U.S. oil prices have surged more than 60% in 2021, bringing major energy companies along for the ride. Exxon has gained nearly 50% this year.

> # 4. Facebook whistleblower to testify; platform outage fixed

> * Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen is set to testify at Tuesday’s hearing of the Senate Commerce subcommittee on consumer protection. After recent reports in The Wall Street Journal based on documents she leaked raised a public outcry, Haugen revealed her identity in an interview on the CBS program “60 Minutes,” which aired Sunday night. She insisted that “Facebook, over and over again, has shown it chooses profit over safety.” Shares of Facebook rose 1% in Tuesday’s premarket after closing down almost 5% in their worst session in nearly a year.

> * Facebook and its Instagram and WhatsApp services are back online after a massive global outage. Facebook said late Monday that “the root cause of this outage was a faulty configuration change.” The roughly six-hour incident marked the longest stretch of downtime for the social media company since 2008, when a bug knocked the site offline for about a day, affecting around 80 million users. The company’s platforms currently have billions users.

> # 5. Tesla must pay ex-worker $137 million over hostile workplace, racism

> * A San Francisco federal court decided that Tesla must pay a former contract worker, Owen Diaz, around $137 million after he endured racist abuse working for the company, his attorneys told CNBC. The jury awarded more than attorneys had asked for their client, including $130 million in punitive damages and $6.9 million for emotional distress. Diaz told the court that colleagues used epithets to denigrate him and other Black workers, telling him to “go back to Africa” and leaving racist graffiti in the restrooms and a racist drawing in his workspace. Diaz’s lawyers said the case was only able to move forward because their client had not signed one of Tesla’s mandatory arbitration agreements.

I hope everyone on this subreddit made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning July 29th, 2019.

# **The Fed is about to cut rates to protect the economy, even though most signs are strong  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/26/fed-to-cut-rates-for-first-time-since-2008-jobs-data-should-be-strong.htmll)**
*****
> The Fed is expected to cut interest rates for the first time in more than a decade Wednesday, a pre-emptive move as concerns rise about the impact of the trade wars and a slowing global economy.
*****
> Friday’s July jobs report should show that the U.S. economy is still strong, with 170,000 nonfarm payrolls being added and an extremely low unemployment rate of 3.7%, according to Refinitiv. That follows this past Friday’s report of second -quarter GDP, which grew at a better than expected 2.1% but showed clear signs of impact from tariffs and trade friction.
*****
> Stocks gained in the past week, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq hitting new highs, as investors anticipated a Fed rate cut, and also a better-than-expected earnings season. Earnings growth is slightly positive so far this quarter, but that could improve with another big wave of earnings in the week ahead, when nearly a third of the S&P 500 report.
*****
> Apple, Exxon Mobil, Procter and Gamble, Merck, General Motors and Verizonare among companies reporting. Beyond Meat, the hot IPO with a market cap bigger than a quarter of companies in the S&P 500, reports Monday. Seventy-five percent of companies have beaten estimates so far and 60% beat revenue expectations.
*****
> It will be the Fed though that will likely have the most market impact, and strategists are looking for the central bank to signal it is open to future cuts but not necessarily promising them. Economists mostly expect anywhere from one to three rate cuts this year, but there is near consensus that this first cut will be a quarter percentage point.
*****
> “The market is pricing in a 25 basis point cut,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist with Prudential Financial. “We already know of two Fed presidents who don’t think we need it, so there’s obviously going to be a discussion, with the strong data. The chairman, who is in the camp that we need to have an insurance cut, is going to make the case that while the economic data are all gaining strength, they are still worried about weakening conditions, due to uncertainty regarding trade and tariffs.”
*****
> The strains of the trade war and tariffs showed up in a reduction in gross private domestic investment in second quarter GDP of 5.5%, the worst decline in that category since 2015. Within that, exports fell 5.2%. The decline in business investment wiped a full percentage point from the final GDP number.
*****
> The Fed has boxed itself into moving rates, says JP Morgan US chief eocnomist
*****
> In the last several weeks, as the Fed meeting edged closer, economic data began to show signs of improvement from a soft patch this winter and spring. Consumers, who comprise 70% of the economy, strengthened in the second quarter, with consumption up 4.3%, its best reading since the fourth quarter of 2017.
*****
> The Fed “will signal they’re’ going to go on if conditions warrant it. It’s clear the chairman and his cohorts are not looking at incoming data in the sense that they are data dependent. They made it clear they want to inoculate the economy,” Krosby said.
*****
> Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpoint, said he expects the Fed to cut rates just once and then stop.
*****
> “They’re not going to say that we’re done. I think it would be too much of a leap for the market. My sense is they’ll leave the door open, but their aim is not going to be locked in for the next meeting. It’s clearly a function of how the data play out,” Stanley said. “I’m just more optimistic than they are about the how things are going to evolve.”
*****
> Investors will also be watching for headlines on trade in the coming week, as the U.S. delegation returns to China for the first round of face to face talks since May.

# Next Week's Economic Indicators - 7/26/19

> The Chicago Fed's National Activity Index kicked off this week's busy macroeconomic data slate on a disappointing note with a still negative reading that was below forecasts. Weak data continued to come in on Tuesday with FHFA home price growth slowing to 0.1% and the Richmond Fed Manufacturing index reaching a multi-year low. Existing Home Sales also came in weaker. Preliminary Markit PMIs released on Wednesday came in below estimates and weaker than the previous month while the services portion saw the opposite results. The release of preliminary Durable Goods and Capital Goods on Thursday came in much stronger than both expectations and the May release. Meanwhile, weekly labor data once again came in at a multi-month low. We ended the week with stronger than expected GDP data, but it still showed the economy slowed versus the first quarter. Overall, economic data didn't have the greatest of weeks with over half of the indicators released weakening or coming in below estimates.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/072619-Eco1.png))**

> Next week is a busy one when it comes to macroeconomic developments. The week starts off quiet with only the Dallas Fed's Manufacturing Activity Index out on Monday. It is expected to rebound to -5 off its multiyear low of -12.1 from its June release. Things pick up on Tuesday with the release of personal income and spending data which are forecast to fall 0.1%. PCE data, Pending Home Sales, and consumer confidence will also be out that day. Ahead of Friday's Nonfarm Payrolls report, which is expected to show 170K added jobs in July, on Wednesday ADP will release their own employment data. Also on Wednesday, there will be an FOMC rate decision followed by a presser by Fed Chair Powell. Markets are anticipating a 25 bps cut in this meeting. After digesting the results of this meeting, on Thursday ISM will release their manufacturing report for July. In addition to the NFP report, the release of the June trade balance, factory orders, and the University of Michigan's sentiment data will all round out the week on Friday.

# The Bespoke Report -- Global Macro Outlook

> This week we're outlining how we see the global economy at present, along with its influence on US interest rates, credit, commodities, and equity markets. One of the topics we discuss in detail is the strong performance of US GDP in Q2, which in addition to upward revisions from 2014-2018 also showed newly-reported Q2 growth that was far stronger than analyst estimates. Smaller-than-expected headwinds from trade and inventory and a massive surge in consumer spending helped push growth above expectations despite weak investment. With the Fed set to join the global central bank easing party at its July meeting, it's part of the reason to expect that the global backdrop is set to improve.

# Financials Appear Poised For a Strong Second Half

> After a disappointing start to the year, financials were the top performing sector in the second quarter.

And technical analysis suggests they may have more room to run.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/2Fva1zL.png))**

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, Financials Outperformance May Mark a Change in Trend, the relative performance of financials versus the S&P 500 Index has broken a downtrend, which we see as a bullish technical signal. This tells us the technicals may now be aligning with our optimistic fundamental outlook for financials, which we highlighted in our Midyear Outlook 2019.

> Financials’ strong performance has continued a few weeks into July, with the S&P 500 Financials Index and KBW Bank Index both outpacing the market thus far. Defensive areas of the market, including the utilities, real estate, and healthcare sectors, have all lagged the S&P 500 since the end of the first quarter. We think cyclicals’ outperformance could continue if economic fundamentals improve.

> “The rotation from defensive stocks, which have led for much of the past year, to more cyclical areas of the market, is not only healthy for the bull market, but should favor active managers who can overweight these sectors,” according to LPL Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch.

> While we don’t anticipate broad market performance to be as strong in the second half of 2019, we believe that an overweight to financial stocks may offer an opportunity for suitable investors based on attractive valuations, a potentially steeper yield curve, and an improving technical picture.

# August: Better in Pre-Election Years, But Still Not Great

> Money flows from harvesting made August a great stock market month in the first half of the Twentieth Century. It was the best month from 1901 to 1951. In 1900, 37.5% of the population was farming. Now that less than 2% farm, August is amongst the worst months of the year. It is the worst DJIA, S&P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 month over the last 31 years, 1988-2018 with average declines ranging from 0.1% by NASDAQ to 1.1% by DJIA.

> In pre-election years since 1950, Augusts’ rankings improve modestly: #7 DJIA, #8 S&P 500, #10 NASDAQ (since 1971), #9 Russell 1000 and #10 Russell 2000 (since 1979). Average performance in pre-election years is positive except for Russell 2000 which is unchanged.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b2c259751b53bc3c3005d4c266dd9fac/b4aa95c4256eed3a-ce/s400x600/345335a8152d24b9b10af91f813c9bf07af456fe.jpg))**

> Contributing to this poor performance since 1987; the shortest bear market in history (45 days) caused by turmoil in Russia, the Asian currency crisis and the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund debacle ending August 31, 1998 with the DJIA shedding 6.4% that day. DJIA dropped a record 1344.22 points for the month, off 15.1%—which is the second worst monthly percentage DJIA loss since 1950. Saddam Hussein triggered a 10.0% slide in August 1990. The best DJIA gains occurred in 1982 (11.5%) and 1984 (9.8%) as bear markets ended. Sizeable losses in 2010, 2011 and 2013 of over 4% on DJIA have widened Augusts’ average decline. A strong August in 2014 of S&P 3.8% and NASDAQ 4.8% preceded corrections of 7.4% and 8.4% respectively from mid-September to mid-October.

*****

# Second-Half Pre-Election Year Blues Absent…So Far

> A little over one week ago, we posted updated charts of historical pre-election year performance with 2019 overlaid for comparison. Like then DJIA, S&P 500 and NASDAQ are still comfortably above average for this time of a pre-election year when compared to historical data. Thus far earnings have supported a continuation of the rally. A 100% probability (according to CME Group’s FedWatch Tool as of today) that the Fed will cut rates at least 0.25% is also aiding. And now it appears the debt ceiling is going to be raised eliminating another market headwind. 

> It would seem the market has nearly everything going its way. Almost, sentiment is running on the frothy side. According to Investors Intelligence, bullish advisors have reached 58%, a new high for 2019, while bearish advisors are down to just 16.8%. Historically these levels have been an early warning. Combined with the historically meager gains in the second half of pre-election years (visible in the charts below), the rally appears to be increasingly prone to faltering. If the market does take a pause and consolidate some of its gains so far this year in August/September/early-October, it would likely improve the possibility of a respectable fourth quarter rally.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 22nd, 2019.

# **Earnings and data could be proof that slowdown fears were overblown  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/19/earnings-and-data-could-be-proof-that-slowdown-fears-were-overblown.html)**
*****
> Earnings season shifts into a higher gear in the week ahead, as investors also watch for fresh economic data that could show that the economy is pulling out of a temporary rut.
*****
> Amazon, Boeing, Microsoft and ExxonMobil are among more than 140 S&P 500 companies reporting quarterly results. According to Refinitiv, 74% of the companies reporting so far have beaten expectations. Based on forecasts and actual reports, earnings for the S&P 500 as a whole are expected to decline 1.7%, the first negative quarter in three years. Some forecasters had projected an earnings decline of 4% or more.
*****
> The equivalent of the economy’s first-quarter report card will be released Friday, with the first reading of GDP. The outlook for first-quarter growth has suddenly shifted upward, after a series of better data releases later in the quarter. CNBC/Moody’s Analytics Rapid Update survey shows economists’median forecast is now tracking at 2.4%, way above the 1% expected earlier in the quarter, when severe winter weather and the government shutdown were stifling the economy.
*****
> At the same time, investors are feeling better about global growth and far less fearful of a recession in the near term. One reason is that China’s data has also been picking up. This past week, China reported first-quarter GDP at 6.4%, slightly better than the 6.3% expected by economists.
*****
> “I think a lot of this is leveraged on economic activity. I think investors have kind of gotten past this notion of global downturn. The China number was pretty good earlier in the week. I do think next week is going to be important for earnings. We’re going to get a great cross section of industries,” said Jack Ablin, CIO at Cresset Wealth Advisors. On Wednesday, China’s first quarter GDP
*****
> U.S. trade talks with China could be also important in the week ahead, with negotiations continuing and investors awaiting news of a summit between President Donald Trump and China President Xi Jinping.
*****
> Dan Suzuki, portfolio strategist at Richard Bernstein Advisors, said he still sees deteriorating fundamentals for both earnings and the economy, even though data appears to be improving.
*****
> “I think it’s a function of expectations were probably dropping too quickly, and I think recent data is telling you that growth isn’t collapsing but it’s slowing,” he said. “I think that’s very important. That’s probably going to be the most important dynamic. That’s probably going to continue.”
*****
> That could make for a choppier market at some point, he said. Suzuki said he could see stocks ending the year higher than current levels but he expects to see the market pull back first.
*****
> The market shrugged off Thursday’s release of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report on the Trump campaign and Russian election interference.
*****
> “This type of thing firmly falls into the category of it can move the needle for the market on a daily or weekly performance basis, but it’s not going to be a longer term story for the market,” Suzuki said. Analysts have said the economy’s performance is more important for Trump’s reelection than the report at this point.

# Pre-election year Mays: Just 10th overall DJIA and S&P 500

> May officially marks the beginning of the “Worst Six Months” for the DJIA and S&P. To wit: “Sell in May and go away.” Our “Best Six Months Switching Strategy,” created in 1986, proves that there is merit to this old trader’s tale. A hypothetical $10,000 investment in the DJIA compounded to a gain of $1,008,721 for November-April in 68 years compared to just $1,031 for May-October. The same hypothetical $10,000 investment in the S&P 500 compounded to $757,335 for November-April in 68 years compared to a gain of just $9,079 for May-October.

> May has been a tricky month over the years, a well-deserved reputation following the May 6, 2010 “flash crash”. It used to be part of what we called the “May/June disaster area.” From 1965 to 1984 the S&P 500 was down during May fifteen out of twenty times. Then from 1985 through 1997 May was the best month, gaining ground every single year (13 straight gains) on the S&P, up 3.3% on average with the DJIA falling once and two NASDAQ losses.

> In the years since 1997, May’s performance has been erratic; DJIA up ten times in the past twenty years (three of the years had gains in excess of 4%). NASDAQ suffered five May losses in a row from 1998-2001, down – 11.9% in 2000, followed by eleven sizable gains in excess of 2.5% and four losses, the worst of which was 8.3% in 2010. Since 1950, pre-election-year Mays rank poorly, #10 DJIA and S&P 500, #7 NASDAQ, #6 Russell 1000 and #5 Russell 2000.

# Liberate Your Portfolio Sell Passover

> Much like the ancient Hebrews’ exodus out of Egypt, springtime and the Passover holiday are often an excellent time of year to consider major portfolio moves.

> Some may remember the old saying on the Street, “Buy Rosh Hashanah, Sell Yom Kippur.” Though it had a good record at one time, it stopped working in the middle of the last century. It still gets tossed around every autumn when the “high holidays” are on the minds of traders as many take off to observe the Jewish New Year and Day of Atonement.

> The basis for the new pattern, “Sell Rosh Hashanah-Buy Yom Kippur-Sell Passover,” is that with many traders and investors busy with religious observance and family, positions are closed out and volume fades creating a buying vacuum. Actual stats on the most observed Hebrew holidays have been compiled in the table here.

> We present the data back to 1971 and when the holiday falls on a weekend the prior market close is used. It’s no coincidence that Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur fall in September and/or October, two dangerous and opportune months. We then took it a step further and calculated the return from Yom Kippur to Passover, which conveniently occurs in March or April, right near the end of our “Best Six Months” strategy.

> Perhaps it’s Talmudic wisdom but, selling stocks before the eight-day span of the high holidays has avoided many declines, especially during uncertain times. While being long Yom Kippur to Passover has produced 55% more advances, half as many losses and average gains of 7.2%. It often pays to be a contrarian when old bromides are tossed around, buying instead of selling Yom Kippur – and selling Passover. From Passover to Yom Kippur DJIA averages just 1.6% and is littered with nasty declines.

# Individual Investors Remaining Neutral

> Last week, bullish sentiment as indicated by the AAII's weekly survey of individual investors came in at the second highest level of the year at 40.29%. Declines this week seemed to have weighed on bulls as the percentage of investors reporting as bullish fell to 37.56%. That is back below the historical average of 38.2%, though, it is also not far away from where bullish sentiment has stayed for much of the year. This week's level deviates slightly from the Investors Intelligence survey which saw bearish sentiment unchanged while optimism rose to the highest levels since October.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/041819-AAII-Bullish-Sentiment.png))**

> The bearish camp seems to have borrowed from the bulls as 21.83% of investors reported bearish sentiment versus 20.38% last week. This is a fairly small movement relative to what could be observed in the past couple of months. For example, last week and in the final week of March, bearish sentiment fell by over 7%. In other words, bearish sentiment seems stable around the lower end of the range from the past few years, now several percentage points below the historical average of 30.31%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/041819-AAII-Bearish-Sentiment.png))**

> While bullish and bearish sentiment remains high and low, respectively, neutral sentiment is also very elevated. At 40.61%, the percentage of investors reporting neutral sentiment is now slightly over one standard deviation above the historical average. The last time this happened was in late July of last year.

# Mortgage Applications Hit Nine-Year High

> This morning the Mortgage Bankers' Association (MBA) reported mortgage application volumes for the week ending April 12th this morning. Refinancing volumes dropped over 8% after an 11.4% WoW drop last week. Refinancing is still running at a strong pace (roughly twice the pace where they finished last year), but the more economically relevant result was the strong purchase application data. Applications for purchase are a leading indicator of home sales, so the new cycle high in purchase application volumes posted this week is a good sign that the housing market remains in a much better position than where it stood last year.

> Weekly data can be tricky to seasonally adjust, so it's also worth taking a peek at weekly data without seasonal adjustments. As shown, we're right near the typical seasonal peak for application volumes, and as-of this week, only two weeks since 2009 have recorded stronger purchase application volumes. That confirms the basic message of the seasonally adjusted index, which is that mortgage applications are running at a very strong pace.

> On a YoY basis, purchase application volumes are not extremely strong, but it's pretty clear there's a healthier trend than the period in the second half of last year. Since week-to-week applications can be pretty volatile, it helps to smooth things out with a rolling 4-week average. Using this approach, the 4-week average of purchase applications is up 8.2% YoY, the best pace since the week ended February 9th of last year.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week ahead?

Have a fantastic rest of you Easter weekend everyone and a great trading week ahead r/wallstreetbets!"
Don't Look Down Upon Boomer Stonks,4,j3b5i8,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j3b5i8/dont_look_down_upon_boomer_stonks/,8,2020-10-01 21:19:55,"I know this is r/wallstreetbets and not r/investing, but remember guys boomer stonks can actually make you money instead of spending it all in some call options.

Here's a good list if you are interested(from my watchlist) that does have some growth(including dividends) and OK balance sheets to help you keep YOLOing your money.

$ABBV

$ASML

$BAC

$BRK.B

$BLK

$GD

$[MC.PA](https://MC.PA)

$NEE

$NESN.ZU

$NTDOY

$O

$[OR.PA](https://OR.PA)

$PEP

$PG

$PYPL

$[SIE.DE](https://SIE.DE)

$SMSN.L

$ULVR.L

$VZ

$WMT

These are some stonks that I like that may not be as hot or in the news as some other stocks but are expected to provide a good and predictable return. You may have many others to suggest and I would be glad to hear what stocks you guys come up with as I have ignored so many that I am tempted to include at least 20 more.

&#x200B;

Edit: I guess I should have tried to make it a little clear. I didn't choose these stonks based on dividend or if it is a tech stonk or not. They are there because they are kind of less talked about yet have good growth potentials, in other words, they are likely to help you grow your portfolio while keeping your portfolio relatively safe(thus being boomer stonk).

That's why I haven't chosen oil or tobacco stonks and still included stonks like $PYPL and $ASML."

#[Today's Top Headlines for Thursday, January 9th, 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/09/dow-indicated-at-record-trump-war-powers-vote-and-tesla-new-high.html)

* U.S. stock futures were pointing to more gains on Wall Street after Wednesday’s turnaround that saw the S&P 500 and Nasdaq log new intraday highs. The Nasdaq also closed at a new high, and indications this morning point to the Dow joining the record run on an easing of fears about a possible escalation of U.S.-Iran hostilities. The projected gains for the Dow would be enough for it to set a new intraday high at the open. It needs a little less than 128 points. (CNBC)
* On today’s economic calendar, the Labor Department is out with its weekly report on initial jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. ET. Additionally, Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, New York Fed President John Williams, Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans and St. Louis Fed President James Bullard all have public appearances today. (CNBC)
* Lighting company Acuity Brands (AYI) is among the few companies issuing quarterly earnings this morning, while home builder KB Home (KBH) and lubricant producer WD-40 (WDFC) issue numbers after the closing bell.
* For the first time, Tesla’s (TSLA) stock market value has eclipsed the combined values of General Motors (GM) and Ford (F). The electric car maker’s stock jumped nearly 5% on Wednesday, closing at a record $492.14 per share and elevating its market capitalization to almost $89 billion, or $2 billion larger than the sum of GM’s and Ford’s respective market caps of $50 billion and $37 billion. (Reuters)
* The House will vote today on a resolution to curb President Donald Trump’s power to take military action against Iran. Nancy Pelosi said some members of Congress have “serious, urgent concerns” about Trump’s strategy, which the administration did not assuage with a briefing or its “insufficient” notification of the strike to Congress under the War Powers Act. (CNBC)
* Trump pulls back from more military action in Iran crisis, promises new sanctions (Reuters)
* GOP Sen. Mike Lee: Iran briefing from Trump administration was ‘insulting and demeaning’ (USA Today)
* Two rockets reportedly hit the Green Zone in Iraq’s capital of Baghdad, a day after Iran launched missiles at bases housing U.S. and other coalition forces in Iraq. The rockets were fired several hours after Trump declared that Iran appeared to be standing down from military conflict with the U.S. (CNBC)
* A Ukrainian International Airlines plane that crashed shortly after leaving Tehran on Wednesday, killing all 176 people on board, was reportedly on fire before impact, according to Iran’s civil aviation authority. The plane’s trajectory indicated it strayed from its route and was on its way back to a nearby airport at the time of the crash. (CNBC)
* Here are the unanswered questions about the deadly plane crash in Iran (CNBC)
* China’s Vice Premier Liu He, head of the country’s negotiation team in China-U.S. trade talks, will sign a “Phase One” deal in Washington next week. No version of the text has been made public, and Chinese officials have yet to publicly commit to key points such as increasing imports of U.S. goods and services by $200 billion over two years. (Reuters)
* A federal appeals court allowed the Trump administration to move forward with plans to use billions of dollars in military construction money to build a long-promised wall along the border with Mexico. (WSJ)
* Following a secretive escape last week from Japan to Lebanon, former Nissan chief Carlos Ghosn publicly defended himself Wednesday against accusations of financial misconduct and misuse of corporate resources. Ghosn adamantly denied all charges against him and defended his decision to become an international fugitive by fleeing Japan as a necessity to receive a fair trial and “escape injustice.” (CNBC)
* Lebanese investigators finish questioning Ghosn, file referred to prosecutor: judicial source (Reuters)

Market and Options Summary for October 12 -,13,ja5tp7,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ja5tp7/market_and_options_summary_for_october_12/,5,2020-10-13 09:08:10,"Daily Synopsis - 

* The S&P 500 increased +1.61% today while the NASDaq outperformed by (+3.12%). The Russell 2000 advanced (+0.67%). The Dow ended in positive territory at (+0.89%)
* The best performing sector was Information Technology(+2.73%) while Materials(-0.17%)was the worst performer.
* Briefly recapping the latest on stimulus, House Democrats and Senate Republicans rejected the $1.8 trillion offer from the White House for different reasons. Based on the relatively broad-based advance in the market, investors presumably remained in agreement that a deal will eventually be reached, either under the current administration or new leadership in 2021. 
* The financials sector (+1.1%), undeterred by the lack of deal, had a solid outing ahead of earnings reports from several big banks tomorrow morning. Elsewhere, PepsiCo (PEP 142.13, +3.69, +2.7%) was upgraded to Buy from Neutral at Citigroup, and Twilio (TWLO 329.72, +23.48, +7.7%) agreed to acquire Segment for approximately $3.2 billion in stock. 
* With the U.S. Treasury market closed for Columbus Day, commentary mainly focused on the bullish price action in equities. Consequently, it’s reasonable to believe that a fear of missing out on further gains was another factor that fueled the positive momentum in the market. The S&P 500 closed within 1.5% of its all-time high. 
* Investors did not receive any economic data on Monday. Looking ahead, the Consumer Price Index for September, the Treasury Budget for September, and the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for September are scheduled for Tuesday. Note, the September Treasury Budget is often delayed to allow more time for fiscal year end reconciliation.

Today’s Bullish Activity

Gapping up to an all-time high this morning is Target Corp. (TGT + $14.34 to $125.19) after the retail giant reported Q3 earnings of $1.36 per share ($0.18 beat) on revenue that increased 4.7% to $18.41B (below the $18.45B consensus estimate) as comparable same-store sales increased 4.7% year-over-year. Q3 comparable digit channel sales increased 31% with same-day fulfillment services accounting for 80% of Target’s comparable sales growth. The company raised full-year 2020 EPS guidance to a range of $6.25-6.45 (vs. prior guidance of $5.90-6.20 and the $6.17 consensus estimate). Calls are outnumbering puts nearly 2:1 with the November 22nd 125.00 call seeing the most action from traders (volume is 11,040).

Also trading to the upside this morning is Lowe’s Companies Inc. (LOW + $6.09 to $119.50) after the home improvement retailer reported Q3 earnings of $1.41 per share ($0.06 beat) on revenue that fell 0.2% year-over-year to $17.39B (below the $17.69B expected) as comparable same-store sales increased 3.0% year-over-year. The company raised full-year 2020 EPS guidance to a range of $5.63-5.70 (from a prior view of $5.45-5.65 and vs. the $5.67 consensus estimate) on revenue that is expected to increase 2.0% year-over-year to ~$72-74B (vs. the $72.53B consensus estimate). Calls are outnumbering puts roughly 3:2 with the November 22nd 120.00 call topping the most actives list (volume is 2,835).

Lastly, shares of Paycom Software Inc. (PAYC + $14.39 to $253.88) are gapping up after Raymond James upgraded the payroll and HR administrator  specialist to “Outperform” from “Sector Perform” and increased their price target to $278.00 from $230.00. Calls are outpacing puts roughly 2:1 but the January 2020 250.00 put is the most actively traded contract (volume is 301).  

 

New 52-week highs (142 new highs today): Amgen Inc. (AMGN - $0.21 to $224.29), Global Payments Inc. (GPN - $2.40 to $179.32), Lumentum Holdings Inc. (LITE - $1.73 to $67.52), NASDAQ Inc. (NDAQ + $0.40 to $105.47)

Notable Call Activity

Some unusual call activity (~12:1 over puts) is being seen in Emerson Electric Co. (EMR - $0.19 to $73.09) which is primarily being driven by activity on two contracts:

January 2020 75.00 call (volume is 5,505 vs. open interest of 12,831): the activity on this contract mostly consisted of three large blocks (1,997, 1,007, 1,006) that were bought at the ask price of $1.45
November 22nd 73.00 call (volume is 1,175 vs. open interest of 162): the activity on this contract mostly consisted of various-sized blocks that were being bought at the ask prices of $0.50 and $0.55
It’s likely that the large block trades on the January contract are new positions given the expiration date but we can’t be sure given the open interest figure.     

Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ - $0.20 to $59.30): Calls are outpacing puts roughly 9:1 which is primarily being driven by a 10K block that was bought on the March 2020 62.50 call for $0.79 when the bid/ask spread was $0.76 x $0.80 (open interest is 4,867). We know this block is a new position given the open interest figure and we can assume the intent is bullish in nature since the trade took place above the midpoint of the bid/ask spread.  

Today’s Bearish Activity 

Several stocks are trading lower following quarterly earnings results:

PagSeguro Digital Ltd. (PAGS - $4.53 to $32.23): The Brazilian payments processor reported Q3 earnings of BRL 1.18 per share, excluding non-recurring items (BRL 0.02 miss) on revenue that rose 30.3% year-over-year to BRL 1.46B (below the BRL 1.5B expected). Total payment volume increased 45.0% to BRL 29.4B while active merchants increased 1.2M to 5.0M year-over-year. Calls are slightly outnumbering puts but the December 20th 32.50 put is the most actively traded contract (volume is 543).

Pinduoduo Inc. (PDD - $8.20 to $32.52): The Chinese e-commerce site reported a Q3 loss of RMB 1.44 per share, excluding non-recurring items (RMB 0.92 miss) on revenue that rose 122.8% year-over-year to RMB 7.51B (below the RMB 7.58B expected) as gross merchandise volume (GMV) increased 144% to RMB 840.2B. Average monthly active users increased 85% to 429.6M year-over-year. Mods are gay for banning me. Today’s ~20% drop puts the stock below its 50-day SMA for the first time since July. Calls are slightly outnumbering puts with the December 20th 35.00 call leading the way (volume is 6,866).

Urban Outfitters Inc. (URBN - $3.70 to $25.09): The retailer reported Q3 earnings of $0.56 per share ($0.01 miss) on revenue that rose 1.4% year-over-year to $987.47M (below the $1.00B expected) as comparable same-store sales increased 3.0% year-over-year. Today’s ~13% drop puts the stock below both its 50-day SMA ($27.80) and 200-day SMA ($26.67). Puts are slightly outnumbering calls with the November 22nd 26.00 put seeing the most action from traders (volume is 3,884).
 

New 52-week lows (149 new lows today): Big Lots Inc. (BIG - $0.33 to $19.00), Carrizo Oil & Gas (CRZO + $0.05 to $6.49), Chart Industries Inc. (GTLS - $0.19 to $53.31), Fossil Group (FOSL - $0.45 to $6.86), Sina Corp. (SINA - $0.85 to $31.73)

Notable Put Activity

Some unusual put activity (~7:1 over calls) is being seen in Analog Devices Inc. (ADI - $2.01 to $109.70) as option traders primarily target the November 29th 110.00 put. Volume on this contract is 2,406 (vs. open interest of 20) which mostly consisted of a 1,221 block that was bought for $2.80 when the bid/ask spread was $2.55 x $2.85. We know this block is a new position given the open interest figure and we can assume the intent is bearish in nature since the trade took place above the midpoint of the bid/ask spread. The positioning comes ahead of the company’s fiscal Q4 earnings report which is scheduled to be released next Tuesday (November 26th) before the market open.  

Gap Inc. (GPS - $0.36 to $16.42): Puts are outpacing calls better than 5:1 which is primarily being driven by activity on the December 20th 14.50 put. Volume on this contract is 8,953 versus open interest of 58, so it’s likely that this is all new positioning. The majority of the activity on this contract consisted of various-sized blocks that were being bought for $0.40 and $0.41, which suggests bearish intent.

Volume Signals     

Quanta Services Inc. (PWR + $0.30 to $42.31): Option volume is running at over 30x the daily average of 240 contracts which is primarily being driven by activity on the January 2020 43.00 call. Volume on this contract is 6,424 (vs. open interest of 2) which mostly consisted of various-sized blocks that were being bought at the ask price of $1.05 (suggesting bullish intent).

Axsome Therapeutics Inc. (AXSM + $1.44 to $31.87): Option volume is running at roughly 3x the daily average of 1,631 contracts which is primarily being driven by activity on the December 20th 25.00 put. Volume on this contract is 4,284 (vs. open interest of 848) which mostly consisted of a 3,789 block that was bought for $2.45 when the bid/ask spread was $1.40 x $2.50, suggesting bearish intent.

iShares Russell 2000 Index (IWM - $0.16 to $158.95): A 14,000 block was bought on the January 2020 164.00 call for $1.63 (open interest is 3,311). We know this block is a new position given the open interest figure and we can assume the intent is bullish in nature since the trade took place above the midpoint of the bid/ask spread.  

Gauging Volatility

The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX + 0.36 to 13.22) has been on both sides of the unchanged line today (intraday range is 12.61-13.73) as equity markets are firmly lower around the mid-day mark today (DJI - 183, SPX - 17, COMPX - 57).

#[Today's Top Headlines for Tuesday, February 4th, 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/04/what-to-watch-dow-to-soar-delayed-caucus-results-trumps-big-speech.html)

* Despite ongoing concerns about the spread of the coronavirus, U.S. stock futures were pointing sharply higher this morning as stocks continue to chip away at last Friday’s losses. Monday’s rally put the S&P 500 back into positive territory for 2020, and the projected gain for the Dow at the Tuesday open should do the same. Dow futures are currently projecting a 300+ point gain at the open. The Dow needs about 460 more points to erase that Friday slide. (CNBC)
* The lone economic report out today comes at 10 a.m. ET, when the government issues December factory orders. Though a busy morning for earnings will see the latest numbers from Centene (CNC), Clorox (CLX), McKesson (MCK), Ralph Lauren (RL), Royal Caribbean (RCL) and Sirius XM (SIRI), among others.
* Dow component Walt Disney (DIS) grabs the after-the-bell earnings spotlight, with Ford Motor (F), Aflac (AFL), Allstate (ALL), Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), Gilead Sciences (GILD), Match Group (MTCH), Seagate Technology (STX) and Snap (SNAP) also among those releasing quarterly numbers. (CNBC)
* Google parent company Alphabet’s (GOOGL) shares slid 3% the premarket despite beating earnings estimates for the fourth quarter, as the company came in light on revenue. The tech giant did break out numbers for its YouTube and cloud businesses for the first time, though the disclosure was limited in scope. (CNBC)
* Google still isn’t telling us about a key metric for YouTube and cloud: Profits (CNBC)
* Shares of Tesla (TSLA) soared nearly 20% in Monday’s trading after Argus Research raised its price target and short-sellers scrambled to catch up to the stock. The move was the biggest one-day jump since May, 2013. In Tuesday’s premarkets, Tesla stock was trading up nearly 3.4%. (CNBC)
* Results from the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucuses were delayed until later today as the state’s Democratic Party said a “reporting issue” caused “inconsistencies” in some data. The top 2020 contenders (including Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg and Elizabeth Warren) will now focus on the New Hampshire primary one week from today. (CNBC)
* Buttigieg claims victory in Iowa caucuses, though no results have been released (CNBC)
* President Donald Trump will be unleashing “relentless optimism” during his third State of the Union address tonight, a speech designed to pivot from his impeachment to his drive for reelection. The theme of his speech: “The Great American Comeback.” (AP)
* The Republican-led Senate is poised to acquit Trump in a vote tomorrow afternoon. Yesterday’s closing arguments offered Dems an opportunity to leave the viewing public with two final thoughts: Trump’s actions were craven and corrupt, and that Trump still presents a clear danger to both national security and the integrity of the 2020 presidential election. (CNBC)
* Hong Kong’s Hospital Authority told CNBC that a 39-year-old man died this morning in the city’s first death related to the coronavirus outbreak. This would be the second known death outside of mainland China. Chinese health officials said earlier that in mainland China the total now sits at 425 deaths and 20,438 confirmed cases.
* No, garlic won’t protect you from coronavirus: WHO pushes back on rampant misinformation (CNBC)
* Coronavirus will likely become a pandemic, warns ex-FDA chief Scott Gottlieb (CNBC)
* Goldman Sachs (GS) is in talks to offer small business loans to merchants on Amazon’s (AMZN) sprawling e-commerce platform. The deal, if closed, would mark the second tech giant using Goldman as a back-end provider of bank-regulated services. (CNBC)
* The FTC said it plans to sue to block Edgewell’s $1.37 billion acquisition of shaving start-up Harry’s, citing competition concerns in the consumer shaving space. The deal, announced last May, would give Edgewell access to Harry’s data and subscription base. For Harry’s, it would provide a platform through which to expand beyond its nine factories. (CNBC)
* Influential right-wing talk radio host Rush Limbaugh announced on his program that he has been diagnosed with “advanced lung cancer.” Limbaugh, 69, said he will take time off his normal broadcast schedule to seek treatment. Last night, Trump tweeted about Limbaugh’s diagnosis, calling the host “a great guy & fantastic political talent,” and wishing him “a speedy recovery.” (CNBC)

#Trading Update

•   Market update – once again, there isn’t much to talk about overnight. China’s trade
numbers were the big macro headline but those figures are hardly changing the broader
macro narrative (exports fell slightly short while imports were inline). Otherwise the wires
were largely void of major headlines. Asia was mixed, Eurozone stocks are rallying nicely
(although are on track to end the week lower), and US futures are up a few points.

•   Calendar - for Friday investors will be watching US Dec PPI/retail sales (8:30amET), US
Michigan confidence for Jan (10amET), one Fed speaker (Harker), and earnings (BAC, BLK,
FHN, FRC, JPM, PNC, and WFC pre-open).

•   Eurozone stocks – the main Eurozone indices are seeing solid gains (up ~60-70bp). Most
major sub-groups are trading higher but tech, fin services, banks, media, and healthcare are
outperforming. Fiat Chrysler is rebounding as investors view its emissions scandal as less
severe than the one that hit VW although Renault is weak as Paris prosecutors open a probe
into its emissions. Technicolor is the weakest stock in the SXXP after cutting its outlook.
 

•   FX – the DXY is in the red again so far Fri morning (the DXY is tracking for a ~1% dip this
week). The USD is weak vs. the GBP and EUR and is flattish against the JPY. Investors are
looking forward to the Brexit speech on Tues from PM May.

•   Asia – the major Asian bourses were mixed: Japan (TPX +0.62%, NKY +0.8%), HK (Hang Seng
+0.47%, HSCEI +0.66%), mainland China (SHCOMP -0.21%, Shenzhen -1.55%), Korea (KOSPI -
0.5%), Australia (ASX 200 -0.79%), and India (flattish for the major indices). China’s trade
numbers were the big headline out of Asia (exports were a touch light while imports were
inline). The Bank of Korea decision was largely consistent w/expectations. In India, INFY
and TCS are both trading lower despite OK earnings from both. Taiwan didn’t trade very
badly despite the underwhelming TSMC guidance.

•   Japan – it was an extremely quiet and relatively uneventful trading session. Focus has
begun to turn to earnings with Retail +2.3% bouncing from recent weakness following Fast
Retailing +1.1% and Seven&i +8.6% earnings beat. Downside was led by Nintendo -5.8%,
trading close to 10% of total TPX turnover, as its 'Switch' presentation failed to impress -
especially with their $299.99 pricing (street was modeling more around $250~$275).
Otherwise, dispersion across sectors was low and larger moves were driven more by microheadlines:
Takata traded at limit high (+16.47%) after headlines saying the co and the US
Justice Department may announce a settlement as soon as Fri over air bags, SMM -4.7% got
hit after Nickel's weakness overnight, while Screen -4.0% traded lower on TSMC's weakerthan-
expected guidance for 1H '17.

•   Hong Kong - sector wise Coal outperformed +3.75% together with Chinese OEMs +2.8%
while Chinese Railways were down 0.4%. In the Chinese property sector, Vanke was well bid
+5.7% after China Resources Holdings has agreed to sell 15.3% of total shs out to Shenzhen
Metro Group at 37.2b yuan. In the Auto sector, Great Wall Motor spiked 2.7% after
announcing a positive profit alert; the rest of the sector traded higher. Despite a pullback of
the commodity complex, Steel +3% and Coal pushed higher driven mainly by further NDRCdriven
expectations of SOE reform/consolidation, China Shenhua +4.1% Angang Steel
+2.5%. The bounce in oil prices triggered a rally in Energy names, Sinopec putting on a
+3.57%, Petrochina +2.6%.


•   South Korea – the KOSPI ended off 0.5%. Samsung Electronics slumped ~3.45% following
tech weakness in the US on Thurs (note that Samsung did a lot worse than TSMC). Hynix
finished down ~0.59% (JPMorgan has a Hynix note this morning and recommends booking
profits instead of chasing the rally).

•   Taiwan – the TAIEX ended off 0.33%. TSMC fell 1.63% after its downbeat guidance
(although the local TSM did a lot better than the US ADR on Thurs which fell ~3%). The rest
of tech didn’t trade too badly despite TSM (MediaTek -0.92%, Hon Hai -0.12%, etc). On the
upside, outperformers included Advantech +1.5%, Quanta +0.79%, Pegatron +0.96%,
Innolux +1.17%, and AUO +1.16%.

•   US equity macro update - the multi-month rally has been underpinned by two main
developments: 1) improved nominal growth (which predated the election by a few months
and is largely politically agnostic for the near-term) and 2) GOD EMPEROR Trump enthusiasm. One of these
factors remains in place (growth) while the other is increasingly dubious (the political
optimism – see below). However, the market isn’t anticipating instant action out of
Washington and in fact the ’17 numbers (~$127-128) don’t really require any political/policy
changes (the problem is more w/the 2018 numbers where the tentative ~$145 EPS forecast
needs some assistance from Washington). Therefore investors may give the benefit of the
doubt to GOD EMPEROR Trump and Congressional Republicans until at least the end of the summer. This
faith though is finite and will likely wind up being disappointed as investors appreciate the
insurmountable complexity and tradeoffs of tax reform and realize that no government,
Republican or Democrat, can provide much added impetus to a full-employment economy
facing the twin structural headwinds of tepid labor supply and productivity growth.
 

#Top Headlines for Friday

•   China Dec trade numbers; slight export miss and inline imports – exports came in -6.1% (vs.
the St -4% and JPM -3.3%) while imports rose 3.1% (vs. the St +3% and JPM +3.4%).
Takeaways from JPMorgan’s Grace Ng - While December export growth, in over-year-ago
US$ terms, came in below expectations, in sequential terms, exports still rose 1.9%m/m sa,
adding to the notable gain at 3.3% m/m sa in November. Besides, imports came in line with
expectations, up 2.1% m/m sa in December, following the surge at 7.8% m/m sa in
November. Commodity imports came in rather mixed in December, although that followed
the notable broad-based gain in November. Looking ahead, the expected modest
improvement in global growth going into 2017, along with CNY’s trade-weighted adjustment
over the past year, would likely be moderately supportive for China’s external trade,
although uncertainty regarding potential US-China trade tensions poses notable risks.
http://bit.ly/2imQ8xz

•   China vs. US – a Chinese newspaper, the Global Times, said blocking Chinese access to its
islands in the South China Sea, an idea endorsed by Rex Tillerson during his confirmation
hearing, would require the US to “wage war”; ""Tillerson had better bone up on nuclear
power strategies if he wants to force a big nuclear power to withdraw from its own
territories” – Reuters http://reut.rs/2jDzLgS

•   China currency bears remain despite recent CNY strengthening – Reuters notes that the
PBOC may have tempered near-term cautiousness and given pause to short-term traders
but sentiment around the yuan is still very gloomy. http://reut.rs/2iri3zz

•   OPEC unlikely to deliver fully on cut pledge – Reuters notes that some cheating is inevitable
and OPEC apparently would be happy if compliance stays within a 50-80% band; OPEC
sources say compliance “is never 100%” and the cartel would be content so long as the
overall rate is north of 50% – Reuters http://reut.rs/2j7gPs0

•   Yellen spoke Thurs night although her remarks weren’t very incremental; Yellen said the
US economy doesn’t face any serious short-term obstacles. “Unemployment has now
reached a low level, the labor market is generally strong and wage growth is beginning to
pick up,” Yellen said Thursday in a meeting with educators. “Inflation has moved up from a
very low level, and it’s a little bit under our 2 percent objective, but it’s pretty close.”
Bloomberg http://bloom.bg/2in61nE

•   Fed unity – the WSJ notes how Fed officials, including hawks and doves, are expressing
remarkable unanimity in their policy outlooks. A slew of Fed officials spoke over the last few
days and most think the FOMC will hike rates 2-4 times this year (most appear comfortable
w/the current three hike outlook expressed by the median 2017 dot). WSJ
http://on.wsj.com/2jeH3Lk

•   Monetary vs. fiscal policy - the Fed continues to clearly warn Congress/GOD EMPEROR Trump that any
material fiscal stimulus would likely result in a faster withdrawal of accommodation (“Evans
Thurs morning became the latest in a series of Fed policymakers to quietly warn that this
may not be the best moment to launch a major fiscal plan or throw too much stimulus into
the economy” http://reut.rs/2j4IZUl).

•   US fiscal outlook weakens – the US had a deficit of $580B/3.1% of GDP in C16, up from 2.6%
in C15. The 2016 figure follows 6 years of shrinking deficits and the numbers are set to
worsen in the years ahead. WSJ http://on.wsj.com/2jcMomt

•   Tax reform/border taxes - Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) on Thursday defended the House
GOP border tax proposal and called it ""a little offensive"" that some U.S. companies are
criticizing it. ""This is not controversial, and quite frankly, it's a little offensive that some of
the major American companies that are importers who do business worldwide are even
raising concerns of this plan, because I don't see them going to Germany or Mexico or China
to raise these concerns” – The Hill http://bit.ly/2jLoQ9a
 

•   Border taxes - Larry Kudlow speaking on CNBC (at ~1:15pmET Thurs afternoon) is
vehemently against the idea of border taxes and worries that this issue could doom the
entire tax reform effort given how controversial it is. Kudlow at one point was being
considered for an economic job in the GOD EMPEROR Trump team (it isn’t clear where that consideration
stands now). GOD EMPEROR Trump hasn’t explicitly addressed the Ryan border tax blueprint.

•   Paul Ryan conducted a town hall on CNN Thurs night although there weren’t many
materially incremental headlines out of the event. Ryan reiterated a desire to pass ACA
replace legislation at the same as the repeal bills are approved. Ryan said Republicans are
moving ""as quickly as they can"" to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, but said he
doesn't yet have a date, and it will take ""a little bit of time"" to do so (CNN
http://cnn.it/2in0HR5).

•   Healthcare - the NYT details how GOD EMPEROR Trump’s healthcare promises will be difficult to achieve
(http://nyti.ms/2jLkQFK) while the WSJ discusses the bipartisan healthcare problem: “the
sick are expensive and someone has to pay” (http://on.wsj.com/2j7eIUU). The head of the
conservative House Freedom Caucus predicted Thursday that the GOP's ObamaCare
replacement plan is “likely to fail” in the Senate (The Hill http://bit.ly/2jqElzM).

•   GOD EMPEROR Trump’s team calls on Republicans to make childcare more affordable – GOD EMPEROR Trump aids are
instructing Congressional Republicans to incorporate measures into upcoming tax reform
legislation to make childcare more affordable. Proposals would allow parents to deduct
certain child care costs. Politico http://politi.co/2irsanV

•   Don’t Let the Dollar Inhibit Growth. A soaring currency could slow exports, fueling populist
anger. Time for another Plaza Accord? WSJ editorial. http://on.wsj.com/2iOJGjY

•   Int’l company-specific news update from Fri morning. The Infosys (out Thurs night US/preopen
India) and Tata Consultancy (out after the India close Thurs) earnings were decent but
both stocks are getting hit in India trading Fri morning. In Europe Fiat Chrysler is
rebounding as investors view its emissions scandal as less severe than the one that hit VW
although Renault is weak as Paris prosecutors open a probe into its emissions. Technicolor
is the weakest stock in the SXXP after cutting its outlook.

•   US company-specific news update from Thurs night. It was another pretty uneventful
evening. DOV provided F17 guidance – the top line was fine but the EPS guide was a bit
below the St. Pandora (P) published an upside preannouncement for CQ4 (the co also
announced restructuring actions). Finally, RYI said that it anticipates seasonally lower
revenue for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2016 due to fewer
shipping days.

#Calendar of events to watch for the week of Mon Jan 16

•   Bottom Line – the big focus during the week of 1/16 will be on earnings, US eco data (US CPI
for Dec Wed morning 1/18), the ECB decision (Thurs 1/19 – this should be a non-event),
China eco data (Dec IP/retail sales and Q4 GDP all out Thurs night/Fri morning), and two
Yellen speeches (she will take part in a discussion Wed 1/18 at 3pmET and speaks at
Stanford Thurs 1/19 at 8pmET). Also GOD EMPEROR Trump’s inauguration is Friday. Keep in mind Mon
1/16 is a holiday in the US (MLK Day).

•   Mon 1/16 – US markets are closed for MLK Day. BHP is scheduled to give its Q4 production
update Mon night.

•   Tues 1/17 – this day should be pretty quiet w/no major eco numbers and only a few
earnings (CMA, MS, and UNH pre-open and ADTN and CSX after the close). In addition, two
Fed officials will be speaking (Dudley, Williams), Chinese President Xi gives a keynote at the
Davos conf., and UK PM May is expected to give a “major” speech on Brexit.

•   Wed 1/18 – the big focus on Wed will be the US CPI for Dec at 8:30amET w/investors
watching inflation numbers closely. Also Yellen will participate in a discussion (3pmET) and
 
a bunch of earnings are due (AMTD, ASML, Burberry, C, FAST, GS, NTRS, SCHW, and USB
pre-open and NFLX, PLXS, PTC, and SLM after the close).

•   Thurs 1/19 – the ECB decision (7:45amET statement, 8:30amET press conf.) should be a
non-event. The other events include Yellen’s speech at Stanford (8pmET) and earnings
(BBT, BK, CHKP, KEY, PPG, UNP, and WBS pre-open and AXP, IBM, and SWKS after the
close).

•   Fri 1/20 – this day will be dominated by China’s eco data (Dec IP/retail sales and Q4 GDP
out Thurs night/Fri morning), earnings (CFG, COL, GE, KSU, RF, SLB, STI, and SYF pre-open),
and two Fed speakers (Harker and Williams). GOD EMPEROR Trump’s inauguration (he becomes president
at 12pmET) shouldn’t be all that important (although many are fearful of investors booking
profits on the “GOD EMPEROR Trump Trade” following this event).

#Catalysts for 2017 – big events to watch for 2017 (preliminary list – additional events likely to be
added)

Jan 24.

of the 2017 Market Classification Review in June 2017.
