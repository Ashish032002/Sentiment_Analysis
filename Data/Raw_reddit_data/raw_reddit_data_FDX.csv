"Prognosis ER , freight me FDX down below , see chart",24,1fh1cfl,https://i.redd.it/0d9dvrsnmvod1.png,25,2024-09-15 07:04:08,"FedEx is set to report its earnings for Q3 2024 on September 19th, following the market close. The current consensus for earnings per share (EPS) is projected at $4.87, with expected revenue reaching approximately $21.93 billion. As always, market participants will be closely watching the company's guidance to better gauge future performance, as clarity here will be essential for setting expectations moving forward.

While I don't possess the ability to predict outcomes with certainty, I can offer insights based on a technical analysis of the chart.

For instance, consider the price action on December 19, 2023, a Tuesday, when FedEx stock reached a high of $285. Despite the initial upward momentum, the market found no acceptance at that price level, leading to a breakdown following the earnings report. Similarly, on March 22, 2024 (Friday), the stock surged upward, once again testing the $285-$289 range. However, as the auction process failed to establish sustained acceptance at this level, the price declined shortly afterward.

Most notably, the earnings report on Tuesday, June 25, 2024, left a significant gap on the chart. According to technical principles such as gap theory, it’s likely that the price action in upcoming sessions will aim to retest the lower levels and potentially fill the gap that was created."

FDX Earnings on 06/25,19,1dnx1qv,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1dnx1qv/fdx_earnings_on_0625/,30,2024-06-25 09:34:02,"As I've mentioned in my YOLO posts there are several bullish things to consider for the FedEx earnings report tomorrow. I promise I'm not here to just serve you purple and orange kool-aid like some fucking 7 year old on the street corner of a walmart parking lot. Here's a list of the negatives and positives

1. FedEx has reduced costs by eliminating daily overtime and double time

2. Weekly guaranteed minimum pay for non-driving positions has been eliminated

3. The 5B share buyback plan is only halfway completed. This meaning that FedEx still has $2.5B to buy back

4. FedEx is implementing a new wave of AI cameras in the contractor trucks. Everyone knows that AI is bullish.

5. FedEx has closed many stations over the last year, with many more likely to come. These closures included layoffs. Both of these are bullish

The negatives

1. The loss of the USPS contract will decrease yearly revenue by $2B. However the contract was not that profitable and FedEx will be able to reduce expenditures on the extra mail flights that will be eliminated


As you can see FedEx is primed for a good earnings call tomorrow and will likely be more profitable as a result of the factors listed above"

For earnings this week there really isn’t much going on except the one stock most people on here joined because of. And there are some other good plays like Cintas (CTAS) which is a great company that I’m bullish on but options are very expensive.

So this is my prediction. McCormick and Company (MKC) will go up for two reason only. We passed the holidays where people made turkeys and to make a good turkey you need seasoning and who makes seasoning. MKC. That means it has to go up. Secondly MKC own Franks Red Hot and I really love franks red hot so it will go up.

Nike might be all about ""Just Do It,"" but I'm here to tell you to just short it. Why? Because Nike's been riding high on hype for too long. Their recent shoe releases? Meh. The market's saturated, the shoes suck nowadays. So, short the swoosh.

Going Long on FDX (FedEx)

Now, onto the tendies. FDX, baby! FedEx is the ultimate underdog ready to take flight.

With the holiday season past us, we're talking about packages flying off the shelves faster than Elon's tweets. And guess who's cashing in on that? That's right, FDX. Plus, they're expanding their footprint internationally, so we're not just talking domestic tendies here – it's global, baby.

So, buckle up, fellow autists. It's time to make some money. Short NKE and long FDX."

1.	Diversion of Cargo: During port strikes, cargo that would typically move through seaports may be delayed or disrupted. Businesses looking for reliable alternatives will likely turn to air freight or other logistics solutions (more on alternative solutions in reason 2) to avoid the bottleneck at the ports. FedEx, being a major player in air and ground transportation, is well-positioned to absorb some of this rerouted volume.	

2.	Alternative Transport Routes: As ocean shipping faces challenges due to the strike, businesses may explore alternative methods for shipping goods, such as through trucking or rail, both of which FedEx offers through its Freight and Ground divisions. This can drive additional business to the company. 

3.	Enhanced Competitive Positioning: As some of FedEx’s competitors, such as ocean freight carriers or other logistics companies dependent on ports, may struggle to maintain normal operations, FedEx has an opportunity to strengthen its competitive position. This could lead to increased market share in logistics and supply chain solutions.

As the title says I have a trading bot which I spent a long while developing.

There are two batches of codes which I run alongside each other.

Batch 1 and Batch 2.

Batch 1 uses some of the judgement of myself and calculations to gather stock.

Batch 2 is just purely calculations which release values which say if it’s worth doing a call, or not worth doing a call.

Past few days the top picks with NVDA, and a small cap  I can post this daily if you guys are interested.

This the data which I have acquired on Sunday (NY) 10th of January 2021, based on the close of the last business day.

Here’s an update to my trading bot. QS looks tempting but I think I can hold off until tomorrow a better company I understand comes on sight.

Only invest in companies you know and have a understanding of and can see they have a future, to lessen any potential losses via trading.

&#x200B;

**Key:**

* Pharma companies are very risky.
* Meme/Hype stocks are very risky.
* Companies that you don't know how they work are very risky.
* Follower companies are very risky because they join the hype train (what NKLA is to TSLA).
* I have a very low amount in options (less than $500), and I have 100k+ in shares and cash.
* When doing options have a lot of collateral, so you don't hit margin call.
* Take the ""Calls"" as very discounted, and ""Potentially A Call"" as somewhat discounted.
* Old money companies are slow. While tech companies are fast-paced.
* Only invest in companies that you do know and see potential in.
* You don't have to invest every day, only when you see the potential.

EDIT 2: I’m not charging anyone for this data and no you cannot buy it - I worked too hard to get it right. I’ll be giving daily updates for it.

Edit 3: My goal is to do 400 successful trades with minimum losses before I say everything perfect.

Edit 7: No I don’t have a paid site where you can get this data. Please do not sell this data to anyone it’s free information. I know there’s discord/telegram admin of paid groups who would try and monetise it. Please do not.

Edit 8: Over 100 people have seen this, I feel like it’s my birthday. I love you guys. I just want everyone to be well off and have money.

Edit 9: 168 upvotes I just can’t imagine I would’ve ever got this, you guys are amazing. But please just invest in companies you know and are confident about. That’s all I ask, I’m waiting for a big tech company to be discounted enough to show up that’s where I would drop 20-40k into it. Only invest in the things you are personally confident about. I’ll be posting this everyday, stocks are a waiting game keep in mind.

Edit 10: 200 UPVOTES WHAT THATS CRAZY!!!  Thank you so much for all the awards, you guys really don’t have to, please spend that money on stocks and such. It’s very expensive.

Edit 11: 453 upvotes I just don’t know what to say you guys are amazing I’m trying to perfect everything for you guys, but please don’t rush to do trades everyday only trades which you are confident on. Thank you WSB I will be a loyal member to the community.

I don’t want you guys to lose money and PLEASEEE AWARDS ARE EXPENSIVE DONT WASTE MONEY ON ME PUT IT TOWARDS STOCKS INSTEAD HAHAHA BUT HONESTLY THANK YOU GUYS.

Edit 13: Tomorrow I’ll update the tickers to companies which have a larger market cap and doesn’t go sideways half the time. This includes removing boomer companies. As some of the companies are pretty obsolete in today’s market, to the point its likely not in view of many others and I. I’ll revolve it more around myself.  I’ll remove many of the SPY500/boomer companies next update so expect the list to be shorter. With batch 2 it’ll be hard but batch 1 it can be done fairly easily.

My (ALMOST) Invincible Call Credit Spread Strategy,728,1bgg3f3,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bgg3f3/my_almost_invincible_call_credit_spread_strategy/,229,2024-03-17 02:34:38,"I got a shit ton of interest on a different thread and in my DMs, so I'm going to post this. I should be selling this, really. I'll probably delete this later.

Let me caveat by saying this: I am working on a degree in mathematics and my father taught me how to paper trade when I was only 6 or 7, I've been doing this for 20 years, but I only created this strategy a couple months ago. I say created because every formula I use to calculate my shit is self-made. My math isn't perfect yet. I'm also **NOT** a financial advisor. Please don't take this as advice.

TL;DR. Basically, I sell call credit spreads way out of the money on earnings week on stocks that aren't really great based on traditional technical analysis. If you don't know how this works, or how to do technical analysis, that's a completely separate chunk of information. Some may call this ""picking up pennies in front of a steamroller"" but I wouldn't call what I'm making "" pennies."" and I wouldn't call stocks like Dollar General, Dollar Tree, and Ulta Beauty ""steamrollers"", but ok.

Ok, ready? Good. I'm gonna post this picture - my model - and explain what each line means. Then, I'm gonna explain how I use the info.

[Call Credit Spread Model - 3\/18 - 3\/22](https://preview.redd.it/v8hqq7br2roc1.png?width=1770&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e7df34d32489cad27bfb99cece56395fde66c91)

1. Line 1-3: Stock Info. This should be self-explanatory. The O/price avg is the sum of the at the midpoint of the at the money (ATM) call and ATM put. I use this to calculate the Implied movement (IM) in line 8.
2. Line 4-7: Credit Spread Info. This is info on the actual credit spread I'm potentially going to sell. SL=Price of the Short Leg; LL=Price of the Long Leg; Premium = how much premium I expect to get for selling the spread. SL Delta = Delta of the short leg. SL Delta is important because, for many mathematical reasons, it tells you the rough probability of your buyer being successful. ex. LULU 585/595 the buyer would have a 4% chance of being successful. I use the short leg because if the price of the stock goes above my short leg, I start to lose money, and that's no bueno.
3. Line 8-11: Stats. These are where I start to use my own formulas to determine whether I actually think it's a good idea. Gain = % portfolio gain expected if you sell the spread and win. IM = Implied Movement of the stock during earnings week. % to loss = how much the stock has to go up to cross the short leg and lose money. IM/Loss Ratio = how many times more than the IM the stock would have to move to cross my short leg.
4. Line 12-14: My Scores. My safety score is calculated using by weighing the Delta and IM/loss ratio, taking into account the width of the spread as a percentage of the stock price. It's not out of 100, but the higher the better. My Risk/Reward Score is based on the mathematical concept of fair wagering based on the odds of loss. ex. if a wager is 50/50, the winner should receive back 200% of their wager; however, in a 90/10 wager, The one with a 90% chance to win should receive back only 111.1% of their wager. I use the inverse of the delta to determine the ""ideal"" reward (options are never ideal) and compare it to the actual reward for selling the spread. This one IS out of 100, So that LULU 585/595 spread is 71.7% of ideal.
5. Misc. If you really want to know what this is, you can probably figure it out. I use it more in my put selling model. Also, I have META listed as a control, since sometimes earnings stocks can be weird, just to make sure my model is working correctly.

Ok, so every weekend, I compile my list, then, I take the ones with the best ""Dave Score"" (I wasn't planning on posting this, so I didn't get too creative) and go look at the stock. Generally, If I am actually bearish on a stock, I'll pull the trigger Monday at open. If I am generally bullish on the stock, I pull the trigger as close to the closing bell before they report earnings. Why? If a stock has bullish momentum, the IV is gonna skyrocket exponentially until the report, and the stock is likely to go up pre-earnings too. So, it's better to wait.

You might ask: Why do you use a bearish strategy even if you're bullish? Simple. People are regarded. They pay way too fucking much for options the week of earnings. If someone is willing to pay for call options 30% out of the money on an overvalued company, who am I to deny them? 1 or 2 out of 100 times, they win. That's why I use that analysis to decide which ones are most likely to win for me. And indeed, I have won. All of them. About 25 total trades in a row out of 70-ish that I've analyzed. ONE of those 70 would have lost (DELL). But my model saw it coming, so i stayed away. I've made anywhere from 3-15% per week depending on how many of these I run per week. I started almost 3 months ago.

This is how my model looked when it was just a baby about a month ago - before I optimized it and did primarily earnings.

[My first real model](https://preview.redd.it/fqtodglqeroc1.png?width=697&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2bb1e0a934bff298fec5dd2bf008be27c07db9d)

[My Model V2.](https://preview.redd.it/93j46bdleroc1.png?width=878&format=png&auto=webp&s=893cd64409e29c65408b917f7b3a41644ae73acf)

[If any of you are planning on buying these LULU calls from me, I suggest not doing it.](https://preview.redd.it/aw65n4b89roc1.png?width=1417&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e0d66a08af156234074f9aadd7ee086e68a0253)

Why call credit spreads and not put credit spreads? Because people are generally bullish on literally everything.

Will this eventually fail? Mathematically, yes. Over a long enough timeframe and enough samples, anything will fail. That's why I made the model, to keep me as far away from failure as possible until I have enough money to have financial freedom. Hopefully I only have to do this a couple more months. It's not sustainable forever. Should you do it? It's not guaranteed, but sure, I don't care. If you want to use my model this week, go ahead.

If you have questions, DM me. If you want me to make a course so you can buy it from me, DM me. I'm not gonna make a course, but it will make me laugh.

Good luck and happy trading.

"$$$ FDX DELIVERING YOU TENDIES...massive upside going into ER, FULL DD inside",72,m2d4sh,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m2d4sh/fdx_delivering_you_tendiesmassive_upside_going/,64,2021-03-11 05:44:36,"TLDR: Fedex earnings is approaching March 18th, stock is down over 10% from its last ER when it reported its best quarter ever. This quarter will blowout expectations, the stock has completely flown under the radar on low volume, options are dirt cheap and average price target is $327 representing over 25% upside, 500%+ for March options assuming the price moves back to where it was right before last earnings. Positions at the bottom.

EDIT: One day after my post Goldman Sachs upgrades FDX to $356 price target with buy rating [https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/FDX/?RegistrationCode=SocialMedia-direct&utm\_source=GeneralSocialMedia&utm\_medium=Social&utm\_campaign=SocialMedia](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/FDX/?RegistrationCode=SocialMedia-direct&utm_source=GeneralSocialMedia&utm_medium=Social&utm_campaign=SocialMedia)

Below are bulletpoints for DD on FDX, delivering you massive tendies going into their ER next week. My last DD was buying puts on $snow that was trading near $400 and now $230 today, resulting in 200%+ put profits ([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kina26/snow\_massive\_dilution\_incoming\_easy\_put/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kina26/snow_massive_dilution_incoming_easy_put/)).

* Fedex reports earnings next Thursday, this quarter includes:
   * Record Black Friday shipping
   * Record Cyber Monday shipping
   * Vaccine shipping and just inked deal to deliver J&J vaccine
   * Record Holiday season shipping
      * This was extended from normally  Jan 1st to Jan 19th, almost 3 more weeks of extended excessive shipping
   * Huge 5% surcharge on all packages that started on January 4th that will be permanent, this will help offset increased costs ([https://www.freightwaves.com/news/most-recent-fedex-pricing-surcharges-feel-permanent](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/most-recent-fedex-pricing-surcharges-feel-permanent))
      * Many retailers complaining during earnings that they saw a significant uptick in shipping costs
   * Increased global footprint and TNT efficiency gains with workforce reduction, FDX should be handling most global vaccine deliveries too
   * Inked a massive deal with Walmart to handle their returns, this bodes well for future revenue steams ([https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walmart-wmt-unveils-returns-called-151303675.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walmart-wmt-unveils-returns-called-151303675.html))
* FDX is INSANELY CHEAP. Forward P/E of 13.79, that is roughly HALF of the SP500 with a very low P/S of .9 and attractive PEG of .99
* Yes it is a bit of a boomer stock, the benefit is that there is low volume that is keeping options cheap and stock price low. A blowout earnings should move the stock up very quickly like we saw in q2 and q3 last year.
* Current stock price target is $326 representing over 25% upside in the stock and easily 200%+ for options depending on expiration and strike.

https://preview.redd.it/vfsecceedam61.png?width=962&format=png&auto=webp&s=577a34e60172a58d4bb5f2623afaa1fa4f158c69

* The above sets up Fedex for a MASSIVE beat on earnings next week and analyst estimates are VERY low. On the last ER call, the CEO noted it was their best quarter ever, first time surpassing $20B and this upcoming quarter will be even better.
   * Here is the kicker, with this massive amount of good news I just mentioned, the stock has gone DOWN over 13% since the last ER.
   * More so, the average Q3 estimate was $4.01 and FDX beat at an incredible $4.83 with massive surprise. Q4 average estimate is lowered by almost 20% to $3.33 when this is expected to be their best quarter ever. This lowered analyst estimate is due to expectation of costs rising but the amount of added revenue should offset the cost which means the earnings surprise this quarter should be even bigger
      * Why did FDX sell off since last blowout ER? This was because they offered no guidance and the market punished FDX unnecessarily for it.

https://preview.redd.it/alnqw0ydcam61.png?width=476&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0869a63479bb1a95c804f407d0874c9090e23f0

* Ecommerce shipping volume is up significantly, isn't stopping anytime soon and many analysts underestimate the double-ship benefit FDX gets from online retailers standardizing free return shipping.
* I suspect this will run up into earnings next week, March 19th $270 are only $6, that represents a bit more than a 5% move from now to after earnings. This should run to that right before ER if not more, then if ER is a blowout you should see the stock gap back up to $300 where it was in Q4. If so, that would be almost a 500% profit. My positions are below, I gave it a bit more time to play out.
* Positions june 300c and 320c

Fed up with losing?

I am actually liking the current chart set up quite a bit. First of all, see in the chart below, it is approaching a resistance which has stood since the start of the year. Though the stock has not quite broke through the resistance yet, I do believe that it has the strength to do so based on the current set up and most recent ER. FDX is currently on a short term uptrend on high volume from a pretty good earnings. FDX missed on EPS by a little over a percent but crushed on revenue earning nearly 200 million more than what was expected by analysts. The overall sentiment for the ER can be summed up by how quickly the stock recovered after initially dumping on ER. Additionally, on the 4 hr chart, the MACD is still pointing towards further appreciation and the RSI has not yet reached the overbought portion of its range.

[4hr chart for FDX](https://preview.redd.it/208vvden2vo81.png?width=1304&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d35507e580b482b258bf994a1529531f7c3d0ea)

Looking at the chart on a much smaller timeframe (30min), FDX is actually forming a wedge. On this timeframe, MACD also is pointing towards price appreciation and RSI is not yet overbought. the pattern resembles an inverse head an shoulders which is bullish and could breakout in the next couple days.

Once again, this is just my opinion on the stock and how I think itll move in the next couple days, there are many other ways to interpret the chart.

Thanks and good luck to all this trading week.

I've heard stories from the aircraft mechanics who work on commercial passenger and freight planes. The cost of flying and maintaining these has gone way up, good mechanics are 1 in a thousand, and the global supply chain is still FUBAR on top of that.

Possible explanation for obvious manipulation of FDX. ER and Walmart Plus.,32,istkbb,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/istkbb/possible_explanation_for_obvious_manipulation_of/,42,2020-09-15 02:08:07,"So FDX was $240+ at premarket. Tanked at open to $235 where it stayed flat for almost the whole day. Then it dropped to $233 where it stayed flat for a couple hours and even dropped to $232 (lower than yesterday's close). Then suddenly, in the last 30 mins  it shot up to $237.

Words through the grapevines are saying that FedEx has an exclusive deal with Walmart Plus tomorrow and it will be announced during their earnings. FedEx has demolished and popped after their last 2 earnings and people are expecting the same again. Their drivers have been busier than ever and the now rumored Walmart+ exclusive deal can lead to another pop at earnings.

It's possible that it'll dump after ER cus that's what a lot of stocks have been doing. But it's strange that the MM would pin the stock all day if they wanted it to dump after ER. If anything, they woulda let it run as high as it could to dump on people after ER. But instead they pinned it flat for the whole day, almost as if they wanted to shake out the weak hands so they could get more positions.

Anyways, I'm hoping for it to pop tomorrow. I might sell tomorrow at open if it's $250 or so at open. My UPS calls are killing my FDX gains right now. I'll probably break even if FDX doesn't pop tomorrow or after earnings. Will hold through earnings if it opens red tomorrow.

Positions: FDX $237.5c 9/25 and UPS $170c 9/25

$UPS VS $FDX,7,10f61vz,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/10f61vz/ups_vs_fdx/,8,2023-01-18 17:49:35,"$UPS and $ FDX are both large shipping and logistics companies that provide a wide range of services such as letter and package delivery, transportation, logistics, and related services. **UPS has a larger focus on domestic ground package delivery** and has a larger fleet of ground vehicles, while **FedEx specializes in global air express freight and has double the airplanes as UPS.** Both companies are very well established, $UPS was founded in 1907 and $FDX in 1973.

  
Due to the **pandemic, shipping services have had a higher demand than ever,** leading to carriers expanding their supply chains to fulfill the high demand for orders.

  
**Is this the time to invest in these companies?**

  
**$UPS**

* From March 2020 until Jan 2022 $UPS was in an upward trend with 165% growth
* During covid, the stock launched to 233$ but now it is down to 183$
* Market cap 154.820B
* Revenue last year was 97.29B up 15% YoY
* P\\B 9.12
* Net Income 12.890B
* Price to FCF 15.45
* ROE 0.659%
* Debt \\Equity 1.222

**$FDX**

* From March 2020 until May 2021 $FDX was in an upward trend with 260% growth
* During covid, the stock launched to 317$ but now it is down to 193$
* Market cap 47.483B

* Net Income 3.826B
* Price to FCF 23.23
* ROE 0.138%
* Debt\\Eqity 1.46

In my opinion, although the shipping industry has vastly grown during covid and continues to grow, looking further into the fundamentals of these companies in my opinion they both are risky investments and I would keep looking for different opportunities.

$FDX looking like it’s going to run pretty hard. Buybacks already started.,1,xvtz6m,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xvtz6m/fdx_looking_like_its_going_to_run_pretty_hard/,6,2022-10-05 04:53:01,"FedEx announced $1.5 billion in buybacks by the end of their calendar year. Pretty sure they started it today after the close in a big way. Over 6 million shares have traded after the close, all in huge blocks for $159.12. Todays intraday volume was only about 4 million. I would expect to see institutional ownership continue to increase on this news. Given the current climate and fedex giving a strong dividend, I think this is a solid recession play. FedEx has a pretty small float for a large cap. It really felt like institutions were busy gobbling up a bunch of the float today. I have no idea if I’m right. But I bought my calls last week and sold half today, riding the rest for a big bag."
FDX hold to January or sell before earnings?,2,it3fwj,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/it3fwj/fdx_hold_to_january_or_sell_before_earnings/,29,2020-09-15 12:06:22,"First post here, Still fairly new to options so I could use some input.

I bought FDX call a few weeks ago with a strike price of 200 expiring January 15th with the idea to sell before earnings.  During this time the tech bubble exploded and dragged everyone down with them but then i noticed that my fdx call was still making money after the shitshow so i held onto it. and now there are rumors that walmart might partner with FDX and be announced at the meeting

So now with earnings coming up at 5:30pm should I sell before the end of the day and lock in profits or should I sit on my option for a couple of months and work through the volatility burn that comes with earnings.

TLDR: FDX 200c 1/15/21 sell tomorrow or hold"

What’s your move with FDX?,20,b2x2ik,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b2x2ik/whats_your_move_with_fdx/,30,2019-03-19 18:25:47,"FedEx (FDX) delivers packages and freight a a global network of customers. The company’s main business segments include FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, FedEx freight, and FedEx services. FedEx Express makes up 57.4% of revenue, but only 45.2% of operating income. This segment credits itself as the largest express transportation company in the world, reaching over 220 countries and territories. FedEx Ground is responsible for 29.2% of top line, which converts to 45.7% of operating income. This segment delivers to US and Canadian businesses, and can reach 100% of continental US residents. FedEx freight earns 10.8% of revenue, and includes freight services of any length. FedEx services controls 2.6% of revenue, and includes various business services to support the company’s transportation services. The business currently trades at a price to earnings ratio of 10.4x, representing a 29.12% discount to the company’s 1 year average multiple of 14.8x. The main reasons for the selloff is slower integration with the TNT Express acquisition, slowdowns in global economies, and competition from Amazon, which as explained below, is completely overblown. 

FDX acquired TNT Express, an air and delivery services company, providing FDX with exposure to a deep European and Asian network. In FY’17, FDX announced a profit improvement goal of TNT of $1.2B to $1.5B between 2017 and 2020. In the company’s 2Q’19 earnings release, management noted this goal would not be reached, but still provided positive news regarding the integration process. At the time of the 2Q’19 call, 70% of the global sales force had been integrated, and the freight products and specialty services segments are growing rapidly. One reason for failing to miss the profit improvement target is a cyber attack the company faced in 2017. The Petya attack cost FDX $300mm in earnings, but since this attack was a one-time event that was not a result of weak business, I don’t think it deserves to damage the market value of FDX. Another reason for investor worries around this integration are high integration program expenses of $1.5B through 2020, which will include $450mm in FY’19. FDX is utilizing productivity-enhancing tools (bots, analytics, AI, etc.) to reduce the number of staff positions needed between the FDX and TNT. These high integration costs will likely be the last FDX has to pay, and they might decrease depending on the amount of positions cut. Finally, the global growth slowdown is a likely reason for the lower confidence in the business, which is explained more below. 

Another reason for the extremely discounted P/E multiple is from concerns around the recent global economic slowdown. There is no denying the economic uncertainty economies around the world have been facing. Brexit has created economic uncertainty in the UK, Eurozone growth slowed from 2.5% in 2017 to under 2% in 1H’18, emerging Asian growth has slowed from 6% in 2017 to 5.6% in 2Q’18, world trade grew 3.5% in 2Q’18, compared with 5.3% growth in the same period a year earlier. Italy and Germany are dealing with slowing GDP, and the entire global economy has dealt with the trade tensions between the US and China. International revenue makes up ~33.4% of revenue, so does FXD deserve to trade at a lower multiple? Sure. But does this justify a nearly 30% discount? I don’t think so. The segment most exposed to international revenue is the FedEx Express segment, which is made up of 56.4% international revenue. Even with the global political slowdown, this segment’s revenue grew 5.8% in 2Q’18 compared to the same period a year earlier. This segment has also grown at a 1.4% compounded quarterly growth rate, showing there is still financial strength amid slowing demand. Investors also overlooked the other three segments, which have seen tremendous strength from a strong US economy, and make up over half of the company’s revenue. This growth was fueled from a 4.9% increase in General Rate Increases (GRI) for the Ground and Express segments, and a 5.9% GRI increase in the company's Freight segment. Overall I think the global economic slowdown justifies a declining P/E multiple, but not a decline as large as what FDX experienced. 

Another reason for the discounted multiple is competition from Amazon, who has expressed interest to enter the logistics business. AMZN announced a 50 plane expansion to its Amazon Air fleet, and a $1.5B operating hub scheduled to open in Kentucky in 2021 with capacity for 100 planes. The company already handles 26% of its shipment centers and 185 fulfillment centers, and some analysts think its recent growth plans will cut into FDX’s market share. I think it is a ridiculous claim to compare AMZN as a legitimate competitor to FDX, and does not warrant a declined multiple. FDX recently stated AMZN accounted for less than 1.3% of calendar 2018 revenue, and is not a significant threat. Additionally, FDX’s history is made up of a series of purchases and acquisitions to build one of the most intricate global networks. If anyone thinks AMZN becomes a serious competitor when why buy a few planes and open 1 operating hub, they’re simply crazy. AMZN will not be a significant competitor in the short run, and any uncertainty around this news is completely overblown. 

FDX is also implementing multiple initiatives to insure its multiple trades back to fair value. FDX announced FedEx Extra Hours, a service that delivers products after regular operating hours for next day delivery and local two day deliveries. Customers already include  AutoZone and Best Buy, with plans to expand to more retailers. The company is growing FedEx OnSite, a service that allows customers and FDX associates to pick up and drop off packages through a retail outlet. This service is available at over 12,000 retail locations, including 8,900 Walgreens stores, helping the company utilize the growing e-commerce market to attract customers. I am also confident FDX’s large market share, increasing efficiency measures, expanding operations, and strong financial history will help it retain its customer base and growing sales. 

For 3Q’18, analysts are expecting adjusted EPS of $3.14, representing a (15.6%) YoY decline. This value has been revised downward by (1.64%) in the last four weeks. Revenue is expected to come in a $17.7B, accounting for a 6.9% (nice) YoY increase. My overall consensus is that FDX’s multiple was unfairly sold off in 2018, and I would buy calls long term. For earnings after the bell on Tuesday (3/16), this is a literal bet. I think investors will focus on management guidance for the integration with TNT Express, and see how financials have been impacted from the global slowdown. Since the stock is trading at such a discount, I don’t think investors are looking for much, but weak guidance could still have severe impacts. I’m probably going with calls, or I might wait until after earnings to buy calls. Let me know what you guys are thinking. 

TDLR: I probably won’t play earnings, but will consider calls depending on the management call. 

Sorry there aren’t any links or sources. Wrote it up this weekend and haven’t had time to go back and find everything "
PTON & FDX: The last remaining tickers this earnings season with positive momentum.,10,ilni54,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ilni54/pton_fdx_the_last_remaining_tickers_this_earnings/,19,2020-09-03 10:54:23,"**PTON** will be reporting on 9/10 after hours and all signs point towards an earnings beat. Peloton offers great long-term financing options with monthly payments comparable to a recurring gym subscription plan. In light of the largely unchanged COVID-19 situation, it seems likely that many users ditched their local gym or offerings like ClassPass for good and replaced it with premium Peloton classes in a safe and convenient at home environment. Proud new Peloton owners are all over social media. Moms can even babysit and bike at the same time. I am looking at 9/18 $95C that could be entered on a red day (maybe tomorrow) / temporary premium drop -- no, it's not too :) Positions could be flipped on 9/10 before market close. Holding through earnings might not be advised depending on the run-up and given potential supply chain issues. Deliveries are currently still taking 8 weeks on average according to Peloton phone customer support :) 

**FDX:** Fedex is one of the last major earnings plays this quarter making it “the last chance to fomo for retail investors”. There aren’t any negative news going into earnings that should stop the run-up. FDX ground is operating at max capacity and the b2b segment is slowly coming back. The outlook going into holidays should be strong as well given the announced premium surcharges for high volume shippers. I’m looking at 10/16 $250 OTM calls that could be flipped or secured with a credit spread the day of earnings.

**TLDR:** There aren't any other tickers left for semi-responsible WSB degens to dump $$$ in this earnings season. Hold PTON and FDX calls until day of earnings.

"Iron condor on FDX, what could I have done better?",17,ectkoi,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ectkoi/iron_condor_on_fdx_what_could_i_have_done_better/,24,2019-12-19 19:31:45,"The mods at /r/options keep deleting my post for some stupid reason, so I'm asking here.

I want to start selling iron condors and the first one I traded was on FDX earnings.

1) As earnings were AFC, I calculated the 1-day implied move as IV / sqrt(365). At that time, FDX was trading at around $162.

2) I made the iron condor a little wider than the implied move, with the following trades to open:

buy 150 PUT, sell 152.5 PUT, sell 170 CALL, buy 172.5 CALL, all of them expiring on Dec 20.

I got a credit of $103, and I had a POP of a little more than 60%.

The next day FDX opened at $151, right at my lower breakeven, and went even slightly higher for a moment, but I didn't have time to close the trade because I got at might computer a few minutes late and the movement was very fast.

At this point, I am not sure whether it makes sense to roll the lower spread or to wait for expiration. Currently it's sitting at -$118.

The rationale behind this trade was to take advantage of the reduction in volatility, which happened, but the directional movement was too strong.

I am now wondering if it did make sense to make this trade (I didn't know too much about Fedex, that's why I chose a directionally neutral trade) and what could have done better.

I also read that for earnings many suggest to use expiring contracts, like I did, but I am doubting that now. If I had selected contracts that were further away in time, I would have had higher vega to take advantage of the volatility crush, and also I would have had much more time for FDX to come closer to my breakeven points.

What do you think?

P.S. I also don't quite understand why the performance profile gives -60 as the maximum loss at expiration. And yesterday it was at -96?!

Revenue actual: $17.05B


The EPS miss, as you can surmise, was an issue with expenses coming in higher than expected, leaving the lowest operating margin in quite some time (20.4%).

An 11% increase in wages drove the margin deterioration, an impact the CEO noted they expected: 

""As expected, the quarter's results were affected by our decision to invest in our team members following the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We remain committed to increasing earnings, margins, cash flows and returns this year.""

The company estimated that hiring and wage growth reduced EPS by $0.48, covering more than the EPS miss (though they also saw a $.50 EPS boost from a lower tax rate), partly driven by the TNT cyberattack. 

While the results were mixed (the EPS miss weighs more than the revenue beat) the company actually ended up **raising** full year guidance from $17.00-$17.60 to $17.20-$17.80. The company expects strong performance in FY19 (this was Q1 19 for them) on the back of parcel delivery and strong e-commerce.

It was reported last week that FedEx expects to hire ~55,000 seasonal workers for the winter holiday, up from the 50,000 they expected to hire last year and the 50,000 they expected in 2016. 


Despite the miss, FedEx also got analyst upgrades today (and some yesterday before ER):

Company|Analyst|Price Target|Date|Implied Upside (from AH price)|
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
BMO|Fadi Chamoun|$ 300|17-Sep|20.6%|
Credit Suisse|Allison Landry|$ 315|17-Sep|26.7%|

Stifel|David Ross|$ 289|10-Sep|16.2%|
Morgan Stanley|Ravi Shanker|$ 245|6-Sep|-1.5%|

FedEx trades at a 22% below peer forward P/E of 14.1x

FDX 14.1x

UPS 15.4x

Peer mean 18x

JBHT 19.9x

EXPD 22.3x

XPO 27.6x

FDX is currently trading well below its 2 year average forward P/E, touching the bottom range of its forward P/E standard deviation Reaching it's historical average would imply a $270.36 price.

Though no one here cares about dividends, FedEx has also grown their dividend 27% over the past year, 36% annual over the past two years, and 31% annually over the past five, with the after hours price drop likely pushing the dividend yield over 1%. 

With Amazon, Wal-Mart, and other giant retailers exploding e-commerce, FedEx and other logistic companies have to shift from infrastructures built for traditional big box retail to those lead by a more tech economy. FedEx expects little to no impact from US/China tariffs (China represents just 2% of their revenues and tariffs effect little of that 2%). The company is also moving to six day workdays to meet holiday demand alongside the seasonal hiring boost. 

The option market priced in a 1.5% move after earnings, but it looks like the sell off will be almost double that. That's obviously not a good sign, but when the dust settles, FedEx could be a good buy on earnings shock and optimistic outlook. "

After sitting in the car with my binoculars for three hours I counted 21 very long trucks, 42 medium sized trucks, and 7 unmarked trucks potentially carrying new Raytheon technology. I’m not sure how my numbers compare to other days because my handler said we won’t ever do that again.

That being said I think FDX 2/7 165c is a very safe bet due to the current traffic that I witnessed today."

In 2019 they added 55,000 seasonal jobs (stock was $165 this christmas season)

In 2018 they added 55,000 seasonal jobs (stock was $225 this christmas season)

In 2017 they added 50,000 seasonal jobs (stock was $260 this christmas season)

They announced they were increasing their rates in January of 2020 and UPS did as well.

When covid happened they announced a temporary surcharge on fedex express and TNT international parcel and freight shipments starting April 6th. 
Surcharges are still ongoing today, with rates being increased either 4.5x or 9x on August 9th (0.10 -> 0.45 -> 0.90 and freight shipping from China to Europe or US is a $1.60 surcharge)

On August 18th they stated-

“As the impact of COVID-19 continues to generate a surge in residential deliveries, we are entering this holiday peak season with extremely high demand for capacity and are experiencing increased operating costs across our network. We anticipate residential volume to continue to surge into the new year.” 

Then they added another surcharge and fees which are effective until Nov-Dec depending on the package. For example, in 2019 peak oversize was 37.50, in 2020 its 52.50. 

They also made their peak holiday season longer, last year it started on Oct 21, this year it starts on Oct 5th. Last year also ended on Jan 5th, this year it ends on Jan 17th.

They are now working seven days a week, delivering on Sundays to meet the demand.

Walmart, target and dicks all said online sales rose 97%, 195% and 194% respectively in their latest earnings calls 

BOA raised the price target of fedex from 177 to 235 then 235 to 255 all within the last two weeks. Berenberg raised fedex to 280 a week ago

Anyone playing FDX earnings?,5,k59ldo,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k59ldo/anyone_playing_fdx_earnings/,7,2020-12-02 19:23:04,"I worked for FedEx delivering packages for a few months this summer and everyone was saying how crazy the volume was and oh god what will peak season be like. Coincidentally a coworker at my new job still works there (yes he has two jobs) and is saying that the volume is double what it was over the summer. 

Earnings is expected 12/17, so an earnings run up combined with crazy COVID volume should drive the price up and over 300. Hell, it touched 297 yesterday on a PT upgrade from Barclays to 360. I'm thinking this is a good opportunity to get in now and get out right before they report, I only just recovered from trying to play UPS earnings.

TL;DR FedEx to the moon

Lets not forget 2 weeks ago amazon suspended delivery service that competed with ups, I know is temporary but is going to help both company  and even if this wouldn’t had happen lets not forget amazon is not the only player out there, you got target bestbuy etc.... 
target this week said that there online digital sales sky rocket to 100%. Just imagine other retailers. The world is turning digital more and more consumer are shopping online so fdx and ups are going to benefit from this. 
If you search online you have ups driver exhaust because they are saying that they are delivering as much as the holidays season so just imagine. Also remember Gasoline is cheap worldwide  that means they are benefiting from that also.
I like ups because America is there dominant revenue. But dislike there pension union obligatory. Fedex i like the fact that there workers are independent no union in the delivery business. But I don’t know the headwind outside of america and Fedex is the dominant player outside of america."

When the stock price crawled back to $114, my inner autist was like, shit this is ripe for the taking, and I bought 4/03 $98p and 4/03 $96p last Friday. Had a chance close out my positions this Monday with a 30% profit. But since I'm an autist WSB lurker, a 30% is no gain at all, and also having regretted selling at double digit gains way too many times, I decided to hold onto them. 

Come Wednesday, there's 0 volume on my puts. The puts still don't expire till next week and even though my diamond hands are getting sweaty, I ain't selling them puts. 

To my fellow autists with tremendous losses on their FedEx puts, I suggest just ride it out. There's still time and when news comes that 1 guy at the warehouse is infected with the WuFlu, the puts are gonna print. 

TLDR: Lost money, Diamond Hands.

stock has taken a hit since earnings where they beat both top and bottom line.  sure they did not give guidance but they have traditionally been conservative in forward performance.  couple of upgrades this past week as well and looks to have bottomed per the daily.

price hit a tested support level of roughly 258ish on 31Dec. this level was tested and held a couple of times since late Oct.

weeklies are cheap, sub 30 IV.  On verge of being oversold.

problem is i could see this stock going sideways for a bit, not much conviction out there... that i know of.  lacks a vol squeeze which i like to target.

Then, the top comment is inevitably “show your positions” which they never actually prove. If anything, they make some bold claim in a comment without posting a pic of the settled trades.

2 - This is a gambit to create short term hype. If you review FY21 financials they generate no free cash flow (cash from ops - capex - stock based comp). A $10 billion buyback ONLY keeps their share count flat at best. It does not reduce it. (509k -503k = 6k. 6k / 503k = 1.2% dilution. 1.2% dilution on 1.6 trillion market cap means it requires almost $20 billion free cash flow to buyback the stock comp. We know stock split means nothing in reality but it's used to pump up the market on your company.

3 - This is weird that it came out about a month and change after quarter end. Seems like management/board received draft financials and didn't like what they saw. A 5% surcharge is their ""fix"" for future quarters.

4 - $JBHT just had earnings with 33% revenue growth and huge earnings growth. Except ALL of that earnings growth is because they charge a fuel surcharge. Without it they had lower earnings than 2021.

5 - The valuation for a company growing operating cash flow 10-15% would be in the 20x -25x normally. This company hides the fact that they can't create real cash flow using stock based comp and they are granting so much that they now can't buy enough back to even stay at 0 dilution. We may see Amazon only grow high single digits (inflation rate) and the premium does not make sense. Same issue as Netflix.

6 - $TGT, $WMT, $COST and other retailers are doing a much better job of leveraging their local stores with delivery. They can share the delivery price burden with their retail store sales and absorb more costs. TGT is growing at the same revenue year over year as $AMZN as of FY 20 to FY 21.

7 - Watch $UPS earnings to get an idea of how the costs of delivery were in Q1. This will give us more insight into what to expect for $AMZN.

I am risk averse so putting like 1% of my boomer portfolio into $2500 Puts. If I am right I expect a COVID roundtrip back to $2100 by the end of the month. I expect $2400 to be the realistic initial sell-off. At $2400 you make $250-$300 into $10k so risk/reward is there. I will have a few thousand worth. Have $1k so far but will add as we get closer and likely after $UPS earnings.

Biggest risk is that I DO think AWS will continue to do well AND I think capex for AWS may be cheaper than expected (Check GPU/CPU prices dropping everywhere and becoming readily available).

For chart fiends there is NO volume between $3k and $2400.

For street cred on financials: My day job is income tax manager for 20+ billion revenue public company.

Edit: 2 new items brought to my attention. They will mark to market their Rivian loss which could trip up the algos that trade on headline #s. Also, $FDX earnings are out and guidance was not good.

2nd Edit: $AMZN just announced they are opening up prime delivery services to 3rd parties. VERY strange timing at midnight on 4/21. Why wouldn't they save this announcement for earnings call next week?"

Lucky thou are for stumbling upon my post. I have found something value and growth players can get behind. I have found one for my fellow gamers, one for the work-from-homers, one for the anti-socials and for the cocaine and hookers indulgers. **I have found CORSAIR CRSR. This is my top pick for the next six months. Stock options released yesterday. It will only take $10k to make over $100k easily.**

Here's the S-1 for the real mofuckas..mofucka mofuckaaahhh: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1743759/000119312520227100/d507744ds1.htm#toc507744\_4](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1743759/000119312520227100/d507744ds1.htm#toc507744_4)

&#x200B;

Corsair is a consumer hardware company. They make money from PC components, Xbox and PS controllers and streaming components so your daughter could show off her mosquito bitten chest for the Chad's on twitch. They basically have monopolized the power supply market for the DIY gamers and is how they've built their brand.  Their memory cards are also respectable in the field because memory doesn't compete the way AMD and INTC do for CPU performance. They also make fans, cases, headsets and mice for computers, all of which are starting to become very popular. They acquired SCUF Gaming so they  have a foot in the console space, which is going to see the growth that will be off the charts in Q4 and FY2021 as the printer brrrrs and everyone stays home.

My DD will include two of the most important things you should seek: **Catalysts and Undervalued Fundamentals**

&#x200B;

And because no one seems to give a fuck about fundys these days, we'll start with

**Catalysts:**

**Generally Speaking:**

* **Gaming is making your fatass, cant-run-a-lap-without-stopping, son cool in school. Look at all the stocks of gaming companies. Hard to find a loser.**
* **Twitch has made it cool to build your own PC**
* **25 day Quiet period expiration expires Monday**
* **Economies of scale and catch-up effect (for my econ majors)**

**Q2 2020:**

* **Two high demanding FPS's** in Call of Duty and Valorant release
* **WFH stipend** employees have been receiving for their WFH conversion; people bought herman millers and your wife's bf built her a new PC with corsair case, fans, PSU and memory cards

**Q3 2020:**

* **Nvidia's 3000 series released in September and sold out immediately.** The GPU is twice as efficient as the next best and for the same price. THIS literally makes people more willing to go big and build a new rig.
* **Valorant** was released in June, so CRSR really starts benefitting in Q3
* **Summer,** which means dad has to buy son the PC he built because that idiot got straight C's in school. I heard they hand out medals for every idiot who participates these days.
* **WFH Stipend** again, as the unemployment rate falls, the amount of money new employees receive increases, incentivizing gamers to build a new PC to watch porn at 240hz ofc.
* **Market realizes the growth in DIY computer builders because of Twitch and WoM marketing. DIY computer builders -- it has been a long time coming.** I built my first computer when I was 15, over 10 years ago. It's easy as lego's and you get more value out of each dollar spent. It is 100% the trend as well.

**Q4 2020:**

* **AMD** releases and **NVDA supply chain** improvement this quarter will make and have made a lot of people orgasm, more so than previous years. The rise of RH trading this year (increases exposure to the brand), all of which means more DIY nerds building PC's to finish the year
* **XBOX release** this year 11/10 will be huge for SCUF gaming (WHOLLY OWNED subsidiary), which makes controllers for the new console. The company's ELITE controllers are sold out online. [https://scufgaming.com/xbox](https://scufgaming.com/xbox)
   * SCUF PlayStation (11/12) controller has not been released yet for the new console
* **Stimulus is finally coming** to all the broke boys, in a lump sum fashion ($5,200-7,800 federally), which means people will SPEND.

**Q1 2021:**

* Will be an **easy quarter** to compete against because the company has been experiencing income growth starting Q2 2020, not Q1.
* **Stimulus payment effect**
* If there's still **no vaccine** by now, holding CRSR will be a great hedge against the market bc as previously mentioned, WFH stipends, PC building and console gaming

**Fundamentals, for my Buffet & Munger enthusiasts:**

**Literally cannot find a cheaper growth stock in the market.**

* 72MM in free cash flow for the first 6 months 2020, with the latter half of the year historically being even stronger. The 6 months was carried by the strong Q2 2020
* 58% YOY growth in sales in Q2 with 22.6MM in income
* Q3 2020 will generate 50%+ sales growth, 35MM+ in income and 50MM+ in FCF (Conservative)
* Q4 2020 will generate 50%+ sales growth, 75MM+ in income and 100MM IN FCF (Conservative)
* 150MM in net income and 220MM+ in FCF Trailing Twelve Month by Q1 2021
   * **I was the Math King in Kindergarten, so don't question my quantabilities.**
* **1.7 Billion market cap**, implying 11x forward p/e and 8x future free cash flow on 50%+ s.g.
   * Logitech is trading at a forward P/E of 20-25 and is worth 13.6 Billion
   * Razer is worth 2.5 Billion and doesn't put up the kinds of numbers Corsair does.
      * **PT estimate: $36-48, but could go to $60 with favorable peer and market conditions**

**TLDR: ALL-IN on corsair. Ride the wave.**

&#x200B;

**Positions:**

**Me & WSB autists:** $20-25 Bull Call spread for 12/18, 2/19 and 5/21. A ten-bagger play. If markets crash to end the year, sell 5/21 and load up on 2/19. I have been buying these, but haven't been given the volume I want from the market makers. I have been able to get in 12/18 for .45c, 2/19 at 1.15 and luckily one contract of 5/21 for .60c

**Pussy Boomers AND MM's:** 1 million shares, sell 10,000k $22.5 call contracts and use the premium to buy FD call options. If $25's don't print, roll them over.

**Optional position:** Puts on Logitech **or better yet,** ***Puts on the guy who negatively comments my post because that guy is the biggest idiot in the room. So, click on the negative commenter's profile and inverse the fuck out of that guy's positions.***

If you actually read my DD, thank you. I'll end by saying only three other times I have ever felt this confident in a play in the last few years. CMG when they were killing people for eating their food, Spotify's DL and FDX when they were trading at $105-130 in April/May this year. If you inverse me here and now, I will crush you."
19k FedEx leap calls,32,1fo4ks6,https://i.redd.it/lb487czktoqd1.jpeg,23,2024-09-24 10:18:44,"This is just my initial thought, but I’ve decided too all in. Hopefully these calls do good during holiday season. "

My thesis for this week is.

Rally Monday, with a bigger support rally Tuesday after Powell shows .75 basis hike, selloff Wed, Thu, Fri. 

The secondary option is that Jerome Powell comes out of the woodwork, BAM! 1.0 hike, and takes a steel chair to the back of every market entry whatsoever, effectively crashing the market. This could be catastrophic and he understands that, which is why he'd never risk sending the economy, and especially the housing market into freefall. After the FDX fiasco this friday, if the Federal Reserve were to issue any type of non status quo rate hike, consider it the beginning of the end.

NYC Hospitals will soon hit capacity,344,fm7f4c,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fm7f4c/nyc_hospitals_will_soon_hit_capacity/,158,2020-03-21 07:32:40,"We are not only hitting the exponential part of the curve for diagnosis boys. More and more patients with hypoxia (low oxygen) are coming in with the same profile - low/normal white cell count, low lymphocyte (that's a special type of white cell that is part of your adaptive immune system) count, high C-reactive protein (marker for inflammation), and lung changes on XRAY or CT scan. Lots of these are healthy young people who shouldn't be needing any oxygen even with the worse influenza. The big NYC hospitals have scrambled to get ICU's converted from regular medical floors and more ventilators. **But we are about to hit the exponential part of the ""critically ill patients"" curve.** 

  
Beds are so tight that we will have to cohort positive patients into the same negative pressure room soon. We are running out of N95s - using the same one for a week straight! You're supposed to use one for each visit for each patient in reality! Even my regular face mask I'm allotted to one every 3 days. What the fuck is going on?!? NYC's health system is going to be on the brink of collapse at this rate by next Friday/weekend - mark my words. I wish it weren't true. This doesn't mean we will stop taking patients. It just means that the expected outcomes for each admitted patient will be inferior to what we should be able to provide as a first world country with supposedly advanced healthcare.

I pulled out of my SPXS position for a modest 10% gain from last night today because I'm still waiting for my left nut to descend. There's no way the market will be able to rebound next week. I wish I had better than my paper hands but all my courage is being consumed taking care of these sickies at the hospital. 

Please consider donating some of your gains to help your fellow healthcare autists stay protected to continue taking care of you guys. Stay safe you SOBs."
FedEx earnings today - What do?,138,14ej61l,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/14ej61l/fedex_earnings_today_what_do/,79,2023-06-21 00:06:53,"Today, FedEx will be reporting Q4 earnings. The Air Freight/Couriers industry operates air transportation and recurring delivery services. This includes companies offering same-day deliveries, scheduled delivery and logistical services. The proliferation of e-commerce/online retail with a growing emphasis on faster delivery has expanded opportunities for this industry, and induced more competition. United Parcel Service, Inc., FedEx Corporation and Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. are some of the major companies in this industry. 

Their fiscal year ends in May, which means the coming report covers the end of its fiscal year 2023. The company typically offers financial forecasts as a fiscal year begins, so FedEx’s Tuesday report will offer investors an early look at what the logistics business indicates about how 2024 is shaping up for the global economy. 

Analysts are estimating earnings of $4.85 per share as opposed to earnings of $6.87 per share in the same quarter of the previous year. Wall Street is expecting the company to report $22.55 billion, a decrease of 7.60% over the prior year quarter. Looking at the full year, analysts are expecting a profit of $14.80 per share. In the previous year, there was a loss of $20.61 per share. On average, analysts estimate full-year revenue to be $90.88 billion, compared to $ 93.50 billion in the previous year.

Last earnings was good though, in the last earnings report on February 28, FDX exceeded expectations by reporting earnings per share of $3.41. This surpassed the estimated figure of $2.76. This positive surprise highlights the company's ability to outperform market expectations and suggests its strong operational performance.

I expect persistent demand weakness, especially at FedEx Express, to have dented performance in the to-be-reported quarter owing to lower global volumes. Increased purchased transportation rates and lower package volume are likely to have affected the quarterly performance of the FedEx Ground segment. A slowing economy has weighed on FedEx results in recent quarters.

In April, FedEx announced its [DRIVE initiative](https://newsroom.fedex.com/newsroom/global-english/fedex-announces-planned-consolidation-of-operating-companies) to consolidate its FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, FedEx Services and other operating companies into the single Federal Express Corporation under the FedEx brand. FedEx expects DRIVE to generate $4 billion in permanent cost reductions in 2025 after the transition is fully implemented in June 2024.

An Analyst from [Raymond James](https://www.raymondjames.ca/corporations-and-institutions/equity-capital-markets/equity-research/analyst-profiles) noted that the initiative will drive better margins, earnings and free cash flow in the coming years. The DRIVE transition, focus on trimming costs and capital allocation, along with a shareholder-friendly capital return program should improve returns, the firm wrote. They lowered its price target on FedEx stock to 280 from 285 but maintained the outperform rating on shares.

Meanwhile, [Jefferies](https://www.jefferies.com/ResearchandAnalysis/Equity-Research/2/75) says ""all eyes will be on"" FedEx's fiscal 2024 guidance during results this afternoon. Wall Street could react negatively to an ""overly optimistic"" earnings target from the company, Jefferies wrote in a research note early Tuesday. An EPS guidance ""materially north of $20 would be viewed as a stretch-goal,"" the firm wrote while a ""realistic range"" would be between $15 to $21 per share. Jefferies maintained its 230 price target on FedEx stock and its hold rating on the shares.

I believe a good report will launch the company up over 10% today, but it might not be in the cards. However, while my initial research was bearish but as I looked more into it, I started to believe in calls a bit more. But what does the technical analysis say? There are indications that the stock will move *both* up and down. Very indicative, right? On the bullish side, the MACD for FDX just turned positive on June 9th and we crossed above the 50-day moving average on June 16th. However, on the bearish side, the 10-day RSI Indicator for FDX moved out of overbought territory on June 16. The [Stochastic Oscillator](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stochasticoscillator.asp) demonstrated that the ticker has stayed in the overbought zone for 5 days. The longer the ticker stays in the overbought zone, the sooner a price pull-back is expected. In addition, FDX broke above its upper Bollinger Band on June 15th. This could be a sign that the stock is set to drop as the stock moves back below the upper band and toward the middle band. 

Guh. I'm going to get a strangle. I'm going to grab a FDX 6/23 240c for 4.55 and the 6/23 222.5p for 3.90. This means I can grab the strangle for $845. It'll be profitable if the stock goes down lower than ~214 (down about 8%) or up higher than ~248 (up about 7%). If it helps, FDX has moved - on average - more than 8% with earnings."

🧙Unlocking 100x Returns: The Power Big Psych Levels and Options on High Dollar Stocks,139,18nzu7t,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/18nzu7t/unlocking_100x_returns_the_power_big_psych_levels/,47,2023-12-22 04:27:35,"We know the market runs on psychological levels. AMD retesting $100? You can bet that a bunch of highly regarded degens are slinging fat bids to get in at that $100 psych level. We love nice, round numbers, and it's pretty obvious that most stocks treat big psych levels (i.e. multiples of 50, 100, etc) as important support/resistance levels.

Now combine stocks trading at big psych levels with OTM options, and you're now looking at 10-100x+ potential returns. Examples to understand how:

# Example 1: ORCL vs $100: 15x 😎

ORCL had earnings last week (December 11th). Post earnings it sold off to - you guessed it - the $100 psych level! $100 has been key for ORCL since 2021.

[ORCL vs $100 over the past few trading days. After post ER dump, it found $100 to base off of. Quickly made a move from $100 -\> $105](https://preview.redd.it/fb8qyovj9q7c1.png?width=3144&format=png&auto=webp&s=fbb7d804065c4e146fbcc89491e503aefa7425b3)

[ORCL 12\/22 $105c chart \(post ER\). Small change in underlying -\> huge change in options.](https://preview.redd.it/u85hb89o9q7c1.png?width=3242&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ad0f8e565ee8965d2bf9688b9bc83fc927f4946)

&#x200B;

In that period of time, the ORCL 12/22 $105c moved from $0.14 at the lows last Friday, to $1.90 this Monday. This is nearly a **15x** over 2 trading days, from just a 5% move in the underlying! ORCL consolidated nicely at $100 and post-ER IV crush allowed these contracts to get super nice and cheap.

# Example 2: AVGO vs $900: 1400x 🤯

AVGO has been nothing short of magic. It treated $800, $900, and $1000 all as perfect support/resistance levels. AVGO also recently had ER on 12/7, during which it sold off to $900. Now with IV crush in place, and with a sprinkle of good news ([partnerships](https://www.stocktitan.net/news/AVGO/caltech-and-broadcom-announce-quantum-research-and-development-jcv126kwus8b.html), PT upgrades), it launched off $900.

[AVGO vs $800, $900, $1000](https://preview.redd.it/35761b2r9q7c1.png?width=3306&format=png&auto=webp&s=f3f04a0e3eeabf22fd64080109a365ef125a6528)

&#x200B;

[AVGO 12\/15 $1050c](https://preview.redd.it/4fjde080aq7c1.png?width=3316&format=png&auto=webp&s=498c77ad91e881c03f3b8c8f959d8a21298727bf)

AVGO 12/15 $1050c made a move from $.05 -> $70 in just days. 1400x 🤯 What really enabled this to amplify was that the IV crush post-ER turned these contracts into pennies. That coupled with the fact that AVGO is a very high dollar stock, which enables out of the money (OTM) contracts to quickly become many dollars in the money (ITM) with a small % move in the stock.

**Tiny % changes in underlying can result in HUGE changes in options for high dollar stocks.**

# Why high dollar stocks?

These kinds of gains are very hard to find in small dollar stocks. The reason is simple: with high dollar stocks, a small % move in underlying can turn penny contracts into deep ITM multi dollar contracts. For low dollar stocks, unless your underlying sees massive moves (think 50%+ move in underlying), these returns just aren't possible. On these low dollar stocks, a penny contract very rarely turns into multi-dollar because this requires the contract to go many bucks ITM. I.e. you'll need a very large % change in the underlying.

As mentioned above, for high dollar stocks, all you need is a small % move in underlying to get penny contracts into multi buck contracts.

# Takeaways

1. Big psychological levels tend to present significant trading opportunities
2. **Options on high dollar stocks trading at these big psych levels can result in HUGE returns.** Penny contracts can quickly become multi-dollar contracts as they go in the money. This is not something you find often with small dollar stocks.
3. Post ER, options contracts face an IV crush. This presents significant opportunities if the underlying consolidates at a psych level. **Cheap contracts => amplified returns**.

&#x200B;

So fellow degens, in short, **options** on **high dollar** stocks at **big** **psych Levels** = **magic 🧙**"

"YOLO - Losses, Storytime, and Due Dilligence from a Chaotic Rabbit",380,fesd8m,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fesd8m/yolo_losses_storytime_and_due_dilligence_from_a/,112,2020-03-07 13:52:36,"Last week Friday I found myself up $325,000 at peak from my wall street reentry kicked off late November with $4k in Robinhood.  As of this Friday that position has reduced itself down into $60k most of which has been repair more than stop loss.

So First... **I'm an AUTISTIC D@#%@#\*T.**

**Rule 1:** of earnings is you take 1/2 off of the table every single time you gain more than 100%.

This is a never break rule... And I broke it.    Yes, I've had some extremely stupid plays...  Yes Robinhood was down on Monday...  None of this forgives me of breaking the number one rule which is **PAY YOURSELF.**

This isn't my first or last trip into the market... I'm staying and this post is me admitting very publicly that I broke the rules and earned the loss.  No, I'm not going to pursue Robinhood for my idiotic moves.  Last Friday at one point I had cashed out $221,000 in PUTS and sat for all of 3 minutes before putting myself into positions that the Karma Sutra would blush upon as ambitiously naive.  This was me trying to replicate historic wins... SO INCREDIBLY STUPID.

**Rule 2:**  Historical Trends are not necessarily an indicator of current conditions.

In the past I prevented such autistic losses with automatic stop losses... I forgot that net as well... and paid.  This is now baked into every trade I have.   **And here begins the healing.**

Having now recollected on my two weeks of frantic insanity (While recovering from a cold the last three days that I hope is not COVID19) I'm looking at the long game of what's happening and I've been doing some thinking into the next big plays while watching other successful autists on this board make brilliant recommendations amongst some of the horrific chaff (Including myself in that comment).

Here are some facts that I'm putting into consideration with my plays over the next 6 months. (AND THIS IS WSB not INVESTING)  So expect some absolute knife jackings to come into play.

**1) Supply chains are broken** \- Meaning goods we normally would purchase simply won't be there.  This is going to hurt any company relying on global supplies including pharmaceutical companies, car manufacturers, clothing manufacturers, cosmetics, alcohol distributors, and consumer goods.  While I could bear down a crap ton of these players... Let's be a bull for a second.  In about 4 weeks when these companies get desperate for shipments they have two people to turn to that we care about for options trading - **UPS** and FedEX **FDX.**   (April 30th UPS earnings and March 17th FedEx earnings).  Barring strange events UPS is going to get a notable lift from emergency deliveries where FedEx won't show that lift until 2nd half 2020.   UPS and FedEx can fricking charge whatever they feel like as long as it's cheaper than Delta **DAL**.  UPS ought to provide a nice surprise bump in their earnings report and I'd recommend calls on mid Wednesday this week starts to look like last week.  Delta isn't going to makeup enough on shipped goods to makeup for ticket sale losses. \*Note - I expect all of the airlines to get a bailout package.

**2) The Fed is using all of it's power to prevent a recession.** \- This is one of their key jobs and should be no surprise to any Bears out there or bulls for that matter.  What's different this time is that it appears the Fed is employing some strong level AI in the preventative measures.  I have no evidence of this, just an awareness that any corrections are being reigned in extremely quickly.  I'm treating this as the new norm and **leaving cash on the side** for any further ""GUIDING"" like what we've seen each Friday and Monday morning.

**3) Corona is real -** Please take an hour of your time and head over to the Coronavirus page on Reddit. This isn't Trump flu or Ebola... it's the first pandemic ever faced by a global economy with real time awareness.  There are going to be some extremely overpanicked plays out there and frankly WSBGod has an excellent basket of PUTS that are worth duplicating if you can on the dips.  Some plays I haven't seen deeply talked about include Starbucks **SBUX** (April 28th) and Dunkin Donuts **DNKN** (May 7th).  These two can't make up in drive through sales what in person foot traffic has driven.  They are going to be slaughtered along with any other corporation that requires social interactions or groupings to make money.

**4) Corporate Earnings reports will match the facts even if the Fed props up the market.** \- Never has it been more important to consider how earnings reports will be impacted by events.  This is a once in a lifetime chance to pick companies vulnerable to supply chain issues and social requirements and kill them with puts.  I'm personally knifing Mickey Mouse **DIS** as hard as possible with $100 strike Puts May 15th following their May 5th earnings report.  Disney has hotels, cruise ships, theme parks and movies that are all going to get mauled.  Further, movie schedules are going to get pushed out from fears by the actors, crews, and studios.   In short, the Fed can hide how bad things are regardless of the number of Covid 19 deaths right up until the first week of earnings where companies have been impacted.  I'm thinking the second week in April is where the shit hits the fan.  If things get worse on Corona I may take that into the first week of April.   This is where the bears should be ready to maul the market.  April 17th 290 and 285 SPY puts look great... once volatility drops to something realistic.  Look to May 15th if you're happier to play it safe.

**5) The Long Game -** There is nothing wrong with buying leaps for short term trades.  I got back into the game when Tesla **TSLA** dropped to $225 and insisted that some of my key contacts buy leaps for 2020 and 2021 as the price was retardedly low.  It was in fact retardedly low enough to make me come back to the market as least in an advisory position until I saw my recommendations making 300% \*LE SIGH.  That type of a win gets you out of retirement.

The same was true for Virgin Galatic... leaps for 2021 and 2022 purchased in December looked tasty.   The thing about leaps as opposed to short term puts and calls is that they give the false reassurance of value.  Think of leaps as calls/puts wrapped up in a Tiffany box with a 1 year warranty or for you degenerates... Leaps are Calls / Puts in lingerie.   You know the package is irrelevant to you... but people just can't resist the joy of unwrapping.   So buy them a g-string teddy or corset with riding crop action leap action.

So... yep... I was an idiot... Yep I blew up a $325,000 position to $60k.  Never again... I'm following my rules, looking at the once in a lifetime opportunity of a pandemic, and I'm going to shiv a cutural icon until it squeaks like Snow White.  ""I do intend to provide aftercare and calls following the knifing""

Good luck and good night you Autists... Thanks for being in the game... You've made it fun for me again."

1. TSM sold their products for more but didn't really make more business showing weakness in phone sector and geopolitical tension showing how vulnerable TSM is to even suggesting the thought of needing protection.
2. Goog barley beat but decline in YT ad could be foreshadowing, now searchGPT competition
3. NFLX adding lots of new customers, improving revenue, net income, and margin beating EPS but price has been very overpriced.
4. MU excellent guidance everything going as planned but was priced for perfection like what else could you say at start of year better than we're sold out 2024, nothing else later in the year would be exciting.
5. FDX cutting costs to improve it's infrastructure which usually gives a big pump for a quarter and then it's right back to failing usually, although some companies turn around but I see AMZN being too competitive.
6. VRT small beat and small raised guidance, still sold off and was very expensive and still kinda pricey for just 18% estimated annualized revenue growth over last 2 years.

These are some tickers have paid attention to of recent, what about you? There's nothing that's screaming of this recent earning's ""*I'm doing incredibly good buy me!"",* which is a bummer

Have you seen any earning's yet justifying actual big price movement? Long term Micron and Netflix seem like good holds based off their last earning's and guidance, but it's not so overly convincing in the short term."

# **Investors will look to the Fed to soothe the market next week, but that may be a tall order  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/11/investors-will-look-to-the-fed-to-soothe-the-market-next-week-but-that-may-be-a-tall-order.html)**
*****
> Markets are looking to the Federal Reserve to be a soothing force when it meets in the week ahead, but stocks could remain choppy if the central bank disappoints and as investors focus on the election and the economic recovery.
*****
> The Fed’s two-day meeting is expected to end Wednesday with minor tweaks to its statement and some clarity on how it plans to use forward guidance. The Fed also updates its economic and interest rate outlook, including forecasts for 2023 for the first time.
*****
> But Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at Prudential Financial, said the stock market could easily be disappointed because the Fed is unlikely to offer more clarity on monetary policy, such as plans for bond buying.
*****
> “The market is concerned the Fed is not going to give us explicit readings on their plans for monetary policy,″ she said. The Fed’s extraordinary policies have been an important factor behind the stock market’s 50% surge from the March 23 low, and it’s also seen as a major factor limiting the depth of the market’s sell-off.
*****
> Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, said the Fed is not likely to tweak much and it continues to buy $80 billion a month in Treasurys. “I don’t think they’ll do anything to the markets either way,” he said.
*****
> Stocks were volatile in the past week, falling hard, rallying, falling and rallying again. That left the S&P 500 with a weekly decline of about 2.5%, its worst week since June. The harder hit Nasdaq was down about 4.1% for the week, its worst weekly decline since March. The quadruple expiration of options and futures at the end of the coming week could add to the volatility.
*****
> Bank of America strategists said the bond market is watching the Fed for any balance sheet adjustments and the changes to its forward guidance, which includes the Fed’s recent tweak in its inflation policy. The Fed changed its policy of focusing on a target inflation rate to an average rate, meaning it may not tighten policy if inflation overshoots its 2% target.
*****
> “We see risk the rates market is underwhelmed by the guidance provided by the Fed, which would support higher back-end rates and a steeper curve,” the Bank of America strategists noted. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield slid in the past week, touching 0.67% Friday, and it could move higher, meaning bonds may sell-off, if the Fed does not clarify policy around its bond buying program.
*****
> Krosby said the stock market is hoping for a dovish Fed. “The market needs that now because fiscal policy is going nowhere,” she said.
*****
> BTIG strategist Julian Emanuel said the market could focus on the fact that Congress failed to make headway on fiscal stimulus, if the economic data begins to disappoint.
*****
> Retail sales for August are expected Wednesday morning, as the Fed meets. They are expected to rise by 1%, and that should be an important look at whether the lack of enhanced unemployment benefits, which expired July 31, impacted consumer spending. Among other things, Republicans and Democrats could not agree how to replace the $600 weekly payment to the unemployed.
*****
> “Depending on the polls and the economic data, the probability of stimulus rises and falls,” said Emanuel, head of equity and derivatives strategy.
*****
> “Our view is that next week is just going to be lots of back and forth with the potential for a further extension of the range for the downside, if the political narrative gets more inflamed,” said Emanuel. Emanuel expects the market to remain choppy and fall further into the month of October, as investors worry about the uncertainty around the presidential election.
*****
> The Fed’s meeting this week is its last before the election, and analysts expect Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to sound reassuring that the Fed will do whatever it takes to support the economy. Powell holds a briefing after the meeting Wednesday, and he is expected to also be asked about the potential for higher inflation. The Fed has said it is more concerned about disinflation, but recent inflation data has been hotter than expected, though still well below 2%.
*****
> “There is a tug of war between those who say buy chips now because inflation is moving higher, versus those why are saying deflationary forces are still weaving their way into the economy,” said Krosby.
*****
> Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex, said he expects the Fed to sound reassuring but it’s not likely to discuss a target for bond purchases or the yield curve controls some investors were hoping for. Yield curve control would mean the Fed would try to manage interest rates by targeting its purchases of specific Treasurys. For instance, it may focus on trying to keep longer duration yields lower, and buy the 10-year.
*****
> Chandler also noted the Fed’s $7 trillion balance sheet has recently declined by about $100 billion from its peak, and its bond purchases are falling behind the European Central Bank.
*****
> “My sense is the Fed is going to keep saying it’s not worried about inflation. Its bigger worry is downside risks. They’ll repeat their call for fiscal stimulus which after this week seems less likely,” he said.
*****
> Chandler said the stock market could remain choppy in the coming week, but he does not expect a sharp selloff. The dollar could decline, if the Fed sounds dovish, and that is a positive for stocks.
*****
> “I don’t think a 10% pullback [in Nasdaq] has caused enough pain to have people capitulate. This is just an ordinary correction, and we’re going to make new highs,” he said.

> # Active Managers Do an About Face

> The National Association of Active Investment Managers (NAAIM) has an index which tracks the exposure of its members to US equity markets. Each week, members are asked to provide a number that represents their exposure to markets. A reading of -200 means they are leveraged short, -100 indicates fully short, 0 is neutral, 100% is fully invested, and 200% indicates leveraged long. Two weeks ago, in our Bespoke Report, we highlighted the fact that the exposure index had moved to one of the highest levels in its 15-year history. Now, just two weeks later, these same active managers have reigned in their exposure considerably as this week's reading dropped from just under 100 to 53.1.

> This week's drop was the second-largest one week decline in the index's history and just the 10th time that the index lost more than a third (33 points) in a single week. The most recent occurrence was back in early March in the middle of the Covid crash, and every other prior period where the index saw a similar drop, the S&P 500 was also down every time by an average of 2.3%. Therefore, it's not much of a surprise to see the big drop this week given the big declines in the market. But what about going forward? Do big drops in the NAAIM Index mean a bounce back for markets or further declines?

> # The Most and Least Heavily Shorted Stocks in the Russell 1,000

> Below is an updated look at the most heavily shorted stocks in the Russell 1,000. Each of these 30 stocks has at least 15% of its equity float sold short.

> At the top of the list is Nordstrom (JWN) with 38.66% of its float sold short. With a YTD decline of 61.86%, the shorts have crushed it with JWN this year.

> With its huge portfolio of office and retail real estate, Brookfield Property REIT(BPYU) has the second highest short interest in the Russell 1,000 at 33.7%. BPYU is down 35.7% YTD.

> There are plenty of other well-known companies on the list of the most heavily shorted stocks. Examples include American Airlines (AAL), Virgin Galactic (SPCE), LendingTree (TREE), Wayfair (W), Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), ADT, TripAdvisor (TRIP), Beyond Meat (BYND), and Kohl's (KSS).

> One name that is no longer on the list of most shorted stocks is Tesla (TSLA). When we provided an update on short interest back in February (a pre-COVID world), Tesla (TSLA) had more than 17% of its float sold short, but that number is all the way down to 8.3% as of the most recent filing.

> These 30 stocks with the highest short interest are down an average of 3.01% since last Wednesday (9/2) when the S&P 500 made its last closing high. That's actually a little bit better than the 3.55% average decline for the rest of the stocks in the Russell 1,000. And year-to-date, these 30 stocks are up an average of 0.60% versus an average gain of 0.81% for the rest of the index. That's not much of a difference!

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/most-heavily-shorted.png))**

> Below is a list of the 30 least shorted stocks in the Russell 1,000 as a percentage of equity float. None of these stocks have more than 0.71% of their float sold short, and they're mostly made up of more conservative names in the Health Care and Consumer Staples sectors.

> Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) has the lowest short interest as a percentage of float in the Russell 1,000 at just 0.36%. Microsoft (MSFT) -- one of the key mega-cap Tech names -- has the second lowest short interest, followed by Merck (MRK), Eli Lilly (LLY), and Medtronic (MDT).

> Somewhat surprisingly, Amazon (AMZN) is the sixth least shorted stock in the entire Russell 1,000. While AMZN is still thought of as a high-flying momentum name by many investors, its short interest levels tell a much different story, painting it as more of a non-cyclical stock like Pepsi (PEP), Procter & Gamble (PG), or Coca- Cola (KO).

> While the 30 most heavily shorted stocks in the Russell 1,000 are up 0.60% YTD, the 30 least shorted stocks in the index are up much more at +8%. This group has MSFT, AMZN, HD, and AAPL to thank for that strong performance!

> # 5 Lessons Learned About Rising Rates

> While the direction of the 10-year Treasury yield over the last cycle was decidedly lower, as shown in LPL’s Chart of the Day, there were still six extended periods where it rose at least 0.75%, and in two of those it rose almost 2%. Looking ahead, economic growth below potential, slack in the labor market, and an extremely supportive Federal Reserve (Fed) may limit rate pressure in the near term, but with interest rates already low and massive stimulus in place, we believe the overall direction is likely to be higher.

> “Even in a falling rate period there are lessons from the last cycle about rising rates,” said LPL Financial Chief Investment Officer Burt White. “Among them: Careful when the Fed stops buying and sometimes the best defense is a good offense.”

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.9.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> While every economic cycle is unique, the last cycle highlighted these key takeaways about periods of rising rates:

> * **Careful when the Fed stops buying.**  The two drivers of rising rates last cycle were economic growth and Fed bond purchases, also known as quantitative easing (QE). The Fed buys bonds to keep rates down, but the start of Fed buying has actually been the time when rates rise—likely on expectations that the purchases would help strengthen the economy. These periods also often followed large rate declines either because markets anticipated the start of Fed buying or the economy was faltering. The takeaway: unless the economy is really taking off, any rising-rate period may pause for an extended period, or even reverse, when the Fed backs off bond purchases.
> * **Sometime the best defense is a good offense.** Lower-quality, more economically sensitive bond sectors actually performed well during periods of rising rates during the last cycle. Rate gains were largely driven by economic improvement rather than a large pick-up in inflation, and that’s typically a good environment for sectors like high-yield bonds and bank loans. The downside is that these are much riskier bond sectors and don’t provide the potential diversification benefits of higher-quality bonds during periods of stock declines.
> * **Don’t expect TIPS to provide much resilience because of their inflation adjustment.** Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) are high-quality bonds that have provided a little extra insulation against rising rates compared to similarly dated Treasuries when inflation expectations increased. TIPS prices are adjusted for inflation, but even with the adjustment, they are still very sensitive to rates.
> * **Investment-grade corporates can both hurt and help.** If credit spreads narrow when rates are rising, investment-grade corporates can post some solid gains in a rising-rate environment, but if spreads are holding steady or even widening, they can be very sensitive to changes in Treasury yields, potentially (although not often) even more sensitive than Treasuries.
> * **Mortgage-backed securities (MBS)** have not provided as much insulation as corporates, but they also have had less downside. While MBS have certainly outperformed Treasuries during periods of rising rates, they have not performed as well as investment-grade corporates. But they also have come with less downside, losing only 1.4% in their worst performing period compared to a 4% loss during the worst period for corporates.
With the Fed still providing strong stimulus and economic growth potentially poised to accelerate, we currently see an increased risk of rates moving higher. We are playing some offense with our equity exposure, which allows us to emphasize a focus on higher-quality bonds. Among bond sectors, we are emphasizing MBS and still prefer investment-grade corporates over Treasuries. History may not repeat, but if it rhymes, this positioning may help add resilience to a fixed income portfolio if rates extend their move off recent lows.

> # Best and Worst Performing Stocks Since the 9/2 High

> Since the S&P 500 and Nasdaq peaked on September 2nd, we've seen rotation out of the post-COVID winners and rotation into laggards in the value space. Below we take a look at the best and worst performing stocks in the Russell 1,000 since the 9/2 high for the S&P. For each stock, we also include its YTD total return and its percentage change from the 3/23 COVID Crash low through 9/2.

> Capri Holdings (CPRI) is up more than any other stock in the Russell 1,000 since 9/2 with a gain of 17.43%. Even after the recent gains, however, Capri -- the holding company for brands like Michael Kors, Jimmy Choo, and Versace -- is still down 52.9% year-to-date.

> Only four other stocks are up more than 10% since 9/2 -- Beyond Meat (BYND), PVH, Virtu Financial (VIRT), and Reinsurance Group (RGA). Interestingly, BYND and VIRT are also up big (~80%) year-to-date, while PVH and RGA are both down more than 35% year-to-date.

> What stands out the most about the list of winners is that only one Technology stock made the cut -- Sabre (SABR). Most names come from the two consumer sectors including cruise-liners like Carnival (CCL), Royal Caribbean (RCL) and Norwegian Cruise (NCLH), Kohl's (KSS), Williams-Sonoma (WSM), Six Flags (SIX), Foot Locker (FL), and Ralph Lauren (RL). Both UBER and LYFT also made the cut with gains of 6% since 9/2. The 30 biggest winners since 9/2 are still down an average of 20% year-to-date, while the rest of the stocks in the Russell 1,000 are up an average of 1.46% YTD.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/bestsince92.png))**

> While only one Technology stock made the list of biggest winners since 9/2, the sector accounts for two-thirds of the 30 biggest losers over the same time frame. As shown below, since 9/2, the six worst performing stocks in the Russell 1,000 and ten of the worst twelve all come from Tech. Notably, though, these 30 stocks that have all fallen more than 12% since 9/2 are still up an average of 5.6% YTD. Were it not for the horrid YTD performance of the Energy stocks that made the list, the average YTD gain would be even higher.

> # Typical Early September Weakness Recovers Mid-Month Sells Off Month-End

> As of yesterday’s close the market was down more than the historical average performance in September. DJIA was down nearly -3.3%, S&P 500 was down -4.8%, NASDAQ was off 7.9%, Russell 1000 was down -5.2% and Russell 2000 lost 3.7%. Today’s rally looks like the beginning of a textbook mid-month recovery rally However, the second half of September has historically been weaker than the first half. The week after options expiration week can be treacherous with S&P 500 logging 23 weekly losses in 30 years since 1990. End-of-quarter portfolio restructuring, and window dressing can amplify the impacts of any negative headlines.

#Trading Update
•	Market update – Eurozone equities and US futures were both flattish for most of the early morning but staged a rally around 5:30amET (there wasn’t any headline that crossed the wire at that time).  There isn’t too much incremental news to talk about Fri morning as markets globally begin to quietly shut down for 2016 (there are only two major macro events left – Yellen’s speech Mon 12/19 at 1:30pmET and the BOJ decision Tues morning 12/20).  The big risk for US equities remains elevated political expectations – this isn’t a subject many want to talk about at the moment but the growing opposition to the GOP border adjustment proposal could threaten to undermine the entire corporate tax reform effort (this has been showing up in the press lately, including in the FT Wed morning and on Reuters Friday morning).  It won’t be until later in Jan (at the earliest) when various committees in Congress will start drafting legislation but investors are starting to pay a bit more attention to this risk.  Other than the outlook for US taxes, there weren’t many big headlines in the last 12-18 hours (from the perspective of domestic equities).  
•	Calendar - for Friday investors will be watching the US housing starts/building permits for Nov (at 8:30amET), comments from Fed’s Lacker (12:30pmET), and a bunch of analyst meetings (AGCO, CNC, HON, and MET).  Also Obama will hold his final press conf. of the year.  
•	Eurozone equities – the major indices opened in the red but staged a rally beginning around 5:30amET and are now higher (up ~30-80bp).  Autos, tech, insurance, telecoms, and energy are all leading on the upside while banks, media, and retail lag.  Europe-specific news was pretty slow (esp. on the macro front).    
•	Treasuries – TSYs have a mild bid after the recent sell-off (2 and 10yr yields are down 1.7 and 4bp, respectively).  
•	FX – the DXY is off small so far Fri (by ~20bp) after surging Wed and Thurs.  The USD is in the red against most major crosses (the EUR is outperforming w/a 40bpbp rally).  The CNY fell further against the USD (by another 16bp).  
•	Asia – stocks saw mixed price action in Asia: Japan (TPX +0.52%, NKY +0.66%), HK (Hang Seng -0.18%, HSCEI -0.09%), mainland China (SHCOMP +0.17%, Shenzhen +0.95%,CSI 300 +0.17%), Taiwan (TAIEX -0.36%), Korea (KOSPI +0.27%), Australia  (ASX 200 -0.1%), and India (down 11-17bp).  There weren’t too many major Asia-specific headlines.  A few headlines crossed out of the China Central Economic Work Conference although none were particularly notable (a lot of the usual platitudes about holding growth in a “reasonable” range, etc.).  
•	China/HK – mainland Chinese stocks rebounded on Fri (SHCOMP +0.17%, Shenzhen +0.95%) but still suffered losses for the week (SHCOMP -3.4%).  Nothing major occurred Fri although some of the headlines from the China Central Economic Work Conference helped to sooth sentiment.  Also a larger PBOC liquidity injection helped cool the recent domestic yield spike.  The main HK indices extended their losses (Hang Seng -0.18%, HSCEI -0.09%).  Within the Hang Seng laggard groups included REITs, telecoms, utilities, and staples (a lot of the “bond proxy” groups).  Energy stocks continued to have a bid (CNOOC +0.6%) while tech did well too (Lenovo +0.42%, AAC Tech +0.44%).  AIA Group and Galaxy both climbed >1%.  Property names were hit and China Mengniu Dairy sank after neg. earnings.  China Unicom saw profit taking.  
•	Japan – the main Japanese indices extended their gains (helped by the JPY slump on Fri although the currency is flat-to-up Fri morning).  Sector moves were interestingly mixed within financial space with Banks +1.7% outperforming while Insurers -1.3% lagged. Banks were broadly strong on JGB yield surge after BoJ's Rinban gave a negative impression to bonds market as they reduced the amount of JGB purchases from last time. Within Insurers, Daiichi Life +1.6% gained, while MS&AD -2.7% got hit as JPM's Tsujino rpts her preference for lifers over P&Cs. Otherwise, commodities including Metal +2.3%, Iron +0.7%, Oil +0.8% picked up from the reversion play as coal, crude price bounced.  Nintendo -4.2%, DeNA -6.8% slumped after releasing 'Super Mario Run'. Taiyo Yuden +3.3% rose after outside broker upgraded to Neutral. Park24 -0.7% slipped as FY OP ending Oct Y21.5bn missed Nikkei preview ¥24bn.  JPM's Sakagami rpts his bullish stance for overall market with his target of NKY/TPX for 2017 at ¥21k, 1,650pts respectively.
 
#Top Headlines for Friday 
•	US taxes – border adjustment proposal faces growing opposition according to Reuters (http://reut.rs/2hB62br) – the initial post-11/8 market enthusiasm was underpinned by a cursory focus on the proposed cuts to statutory corporate tax rates.  However, investors in the last few weeks have spent more time focusing on the intricacies of the Trump/Ryan proposal and opposition to certain details, in particular the border adjustment idea, is growing.  This was the subject of a pg. 1 FT article Wed morning (“Republicans face corporate tax rebellion”) and is talked about in a Reuters article Fri morning (“U.S. tax reform proposal on border trade faces growing opposition”).  Border adjustments are a key piece of the GOP corporate tax reform agenda and rates may not be able to move materially lower w/o it (w/o border adjustments some think the whole House tax plan would “collapse”).  JPMorgan’s M Feroli wrote about border adjustments in this note (http://bit.ly/2gvBmHF) and JPM’s retail analyst Matt Boss discussed the impact of corporate tax reform on his sector in a note Fri morning (http://bit.ly/2gRoCw1).  
•	Obama warned that the US will retaliate against Russia for hacking the US election.  “I think there is no doubt that when any foreign government tries to impact the integrity of our elections ... we need to take action” – Washington Post   http://wapo.st/2hCa6Wa   
•	Larry Kudlow has emerged as a leading candidate to become head of Trump’s White House Council of Economic Advisors – WSJ     http://on.wsj.com/2gQ7ANt   
•	Trump rally - the Dow’s 8% gain in the five weeks after Donald Trump’s victory is the biggest surge following any U.S. presidential election in history; history suggests the gains could continue – WSJ   http://on.wsj.com/2gR5TRy   
•	Company-specific news update from Thurs night 12/15.  ADBE’s earnings overall were solid; the key metric is Digital Media ARR (Annualized Recurring Revs) coming in at $4.01B (vs. the St $3.97B).  The ADBE F17 income statement guide is a touch under the St but in general the result was solid.  JBL’s results were nicely ahead of the St (w/the AAPL-focused DM revs beating guidance) and the outlook was bright too (JBL saw a big after-hours rally).  ORCL continues to face the same dichotomy as before – the new cloud businesses are doing very well (non-GAAP SaaS/PaaS revs came in up ~89% CC which is nicely ahead of the 80% growth guidance) while the legacy ones suffer (legacy new SW licenses came in $1.347B vs. the St $1.44B).  PCLN announced that Glenn Fogel, the company's current Head of Strategy and Executive Vice President of Corporate Development, has been named CEO of the company and SABR has appointed Sean Menke as president, CEO and a member of Sabre's board.  Away from tech, CNC provided 2017 guidance and the EPS range 4.40-4.85 was light of the St (St is at 4.83); CNC cites increased healthcare uncertainty following the election for the subdued guide (CNC says if its Marketplace business performs inline w/’16 levels next year then EPS would be at the upper-end of guidance which is inline w/the St).  A judge has ruled that GILD must pay MRK $2.54B in hep-C royalties (per Bloomberg; GILD said it disagrees w/the decision and will appeal).  MET and TERP also had ’17 guidance metrics on the tape after the close.  DOW said it will exercise its option to convert all of the Series A preferred stock into shares of common stock (the conversion of all four million shares of Series A preferred stock, will result in an additional 96.804 million shares of outstanding Dow common stock).  GNC announced that all corporate stores will close on December 28 and reopen on December 29, when GNC will be providing customers a dramatically improved experience with the launch of One New GNC (#ONEnewGNC).

Republicans are guaranteeing that the ~20MM people now receiving coverage under ACA won’t lose their plans after the repeal takes place.  Republicans have not settled on the details or the timing of their replacement plan.  NYT   http://nyti.ms/2h7KkYK

#Macro Update
•	The same factors as before continue to exert upside influence on equity prices -Dec seasonality, a penchant to “chase” from people left behind by the post-11/8 rally, news/liquidity vacuums, Trump/Ryan fiscal/regulatory anticipation (this obviously remains the key driver of stocks), and solid nominal economic growth.  After the flash PMIs Thurs morning there really are no additional macro events left on the 2016 calendar (other than Yellen’s speech Mon 12/19 at 1:30pmET and the BOJ Tues morning 12/20) and thus the current optimism can continue propagating for another two weeks at least.  Sentiment remains upbeat on the prospects for stocks over the next two weeks into year-end (or until the inauguration on 1/20) although there certainly is evidence of rising skepticism behind the scenes and this may become more apparent once the year-end non-fundamental effects fade.  Elevated political expectations remain (by far) the biggest risk to the market and while it won’t be until early Feb when the various Congressional committees start producing rough tax reform drafts, investors are beginning to pay a bit more attention to some of the particulars of the Ryan/Trump agenda (specifically, the whole border adjustment issue, which was discussed in the Wed morning FT article “Republicans face corporate tax rebellion” and which JPMorgan wrote about here http://bit.ly/2gvBmHF, was one of the factors that weighed hard on apparel-linked names such as PVH, RL, COH, KORS, UA, URBN, JWN, TIF, etc., during Thurs trading).  The SPX is on pace to earn ~$116-117 for this year and the St pre-Trump was modeling ~$127 for ’17.  On ~$127 the current PE is elevated at ~17.8x but not ridiculous (although the ERP has compressed a lot more than the PE has risen of late given the move in TSYs – in Aug the ERP was ~420bp but that has since declined to ~300bp).  If the full Trump/Ryan agenda is implemented, it could eventually be worth ~$20 to EPS over the course of multiple years (as written about in this JPMorgan note http://bit.ly/2hmIsz9).
 
#Calendar of events to watch for the week of Mon Dec 19
•	The week of 12/19 will suffer from reduced attendance and liquidity but there are actually a bunch of earnings reports to keep an eye on, including: LEN (Mon morning 12/19), BBRY, CCL, DRI, FDS, GIS, KMX, NAV, VAL (Tues morning 12/20), FDX, NKE (Tues night 12/20), ACN, ATU, FINL, LNN, PAYX, WGO (Wed morning 12/21), BBBY, MU, RHT (Wed night 12/21), CAG (Thurs morning 12/22), and CALM (Thurs night 12/22).  In addition to the busy earnings schedule a lot of eco numbers are on the calendar, the most important of which will be US Nov PCE (Thurs 12/22 at 10amET), while Yellen is due to speak on the state of the jobs market Mon 12/19 (at 1:30pmET).  Finally, the BOJ decision (Tues morning 12/20) should be a non-event.
 
#Catalysts for 2017 – big events to watch for 2017 (preliminary list – additional events likely to be added)
•	CES – the Consumer Electronics Show formally runs from Jan 5-8 in Las Vegas but “media days” take place Jan 3-4.  
•	US Dec jobs report Fri 1/6.
•	JPMorgan Healthcare Conf.  Jan 9-13.  San Francisco.  Healthcare is one of the most hated sectors right now and this is one of the industry’s biggest events.
•	US bank earnings season kicks off Fri 1/13 (BAC, JPM, PNC, and WFC all report that day).
•	Earnings - week of Mon 1/16 is the first big one of the CQ4 earnings season.
•	World Economic Forum 1/17-20 in Davos.
•	ECB – first ECB decision of the year will occur on Jan 19.
•	Trump inauguration Fri 1/20.
•	Trump priorities – Trump will have a finite stock of political capital but a broad agenda, including tax reform (individual and corporate), infrastructure spending, deregulation (ACA, Dodd-Frank, fiduciary rule, etc.), immigration reform, trade deal adjustments, Supreme Court nominees (at least one).  What parts of the platform are prioritized and which get deemphasized?  
•	Trump fiscal specifics - what are the particulars of the tax reform bills – rates, deductions, etc.?  How will the fiscal priorities be sequenced?  Will corporate and individual tax reform get tackled separately, in which case the latter may not happen until the end of ’17 or early ’18?  Will Republicans utilize “reconciliation” to pass tax reform (which could limit the scope of fiscal stimulus given the need for any legislation passed in this manner to be deficit-neutral) or seek the support of some Democrats (which could dilute GOP priorities)?  Can Republicans secure relative unanimity in the Senate to even utilize reconciliation (the GOP will have 52 seats in 2017 but at least 8 of them could raise objections to some parts of the Trump fiscal agenda)?
•	Fed appointment decisions – Trump has two appointments to immediately make to the Federal Reserve Board.  Also, Yellen’s term as Chair ends 2/3/18 and she will likely serve until that date although speculation of her replacement should kick into high gear around the spring/summer of ’17.  
•	Foreign policy - does Trump unequivocally express support for important and historic US military alliances such as NATO?  What actions are taken in retaliation for cyberattacks waged against the US over the last several months?  Where does Trump go on his first foreign trips (these are usually seen as a signal of foreign policy priorities for any incoming president)?  Trump will quickly need to formulate specific policies w/regards to China and the South China Sea, North Korea’s nuclear program, and Russia’s behavior on its western border.  Does the recent antagonism towards China over the “One China” policy persist?  According to media reports, Obama has communicated to Trump how the NK nuclear program is the single largest foreign policy challenge facing the US.  Also it will be interesting to hear Trump’s view on sustaining the sanctions against Russia (for the unlawful seizure of Crimea) and retaining the Iran nuclear deal.  
•	Japan – there is speculation Abe could call elections in the Jan timeframe.
•	US banks – the Fed will prob. publish the ’17 CCAR/stress test criteria around the end of Jan (the criteria was released Jan 28, 2016 for the last testing cycle).  
•	Italy – Italian Constitutional Court to hold hearing on legitimacy of Italian electoral law on Jan 24.
•	Fed – first Fed decision of the year will occur on Feb 1.
•	Netherlands will have national elections Mar 15.
•	Fed meeting – first press conf./dot plot decision of the year is Mar 15.  
•	G20 Fin Min/central bank governors meeting Mar 17-18 in Germany.  
•	China’s National People’s Congress (NPC) usually takes place in mid-Mar; the gov’t will formally publish its 2017 economic objectives at this event.
•	US debt ceiling - the debt limit has been suspended since late ’15 but is due to be reinstated on Mar 16, 2017.
•	EU Leaders Summit in late Mar – this could be the forum at which the UK formally triggers Article 50 (UK PM May has said she wants to trigger Article 50 before Mar).
•	Deutsche Bank US RMBS settlement (investors assume the final settlement will happen by the end of Q1 for an amount in the ~$4-5B range).
•	WFC’s “living will” – WFC will resubmit its living will in the Mar timeframe.  Normally this wouldn’t be a major event but if WFC’s living will is deemed inadequate again the Fed could raise the company’s capital requirements.  
•	France first-round presidential election Apr 23 (run-off is May 7).
•	US Treasury publishes semi-annual currency report around Apr timeframe (investors will watch China designation closely).
•	US gov’t funding – current spending legislation will keep the gov’t funding until Apr 28
•	G7 Leaders Summit May 26-27 in Italy.  
•	Italy – new elections are likely in the June timeframe.  
•	China/MSCI - MSCI will announce the result of the China A shares inclusion proposal as part of the 2017 Market Classification Review in June 2017.  
•	G20 Leaders Summit Jul 7-8 2017 in Germany.  
•	German elections – the next German elections will be held between Aug and Oct 2017.    
 
#Trump Transition 
•	US taxes – border adjustment proposal faces growing opposition according to Reuters (http://reut.rs/2hB62br) – the initial post-11/8 market enthusiasm was underpinned by a cursory focus on the proposed cuts to statutory corporate tax rates.  However, investors in the last few weeks have spent more time focusing on the intricacies of the Trump/Ryan proposal and opposition to certain details, in particular the border adjustment idea, is growing.  This was the subject of a pg. 1 FT article Wed morning (“Republicans face corporate tax rebellion”) and is talked about in a Reuters article Fri morning (“U.S. tax reform proposal on border trade faces growing opposition”).  Border adjustments are a key piece of the GOP corporate tax reform agenda and rates may not be able to move materially lower w/o it (w/o border adjustments some think the whole House tax plan would “collapse”).  JPMorgan’s M Feroli wrote about border adjustments in this note (http://bit.ly/2gvBmHF) and JPM’s retail analyst Matt Boss discussed the impact of corporate tax reform on his sector in a note Fri morning (http://bit.ly/2gRoCw1).

I asked drivers on r/fedex for DD. Here's what they said:,217,ioicyp,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ioicyp/i_asked_drivers_on_rfedex_for_dd_heres_what_they/,82,2020-09-08 04:43:51,"Just some anecdotal Fedex DD for FDX gang.

""I'm not a driver, but I do get to see the numbers. The volume through Christmas last year experienced a 16% increase than the previous years. Since the pandemic, we have experienced a 27% increase. For reference, last Christmas FedEx experienced record breaking package volumes. Since the pandemic, FedEx has shattered that record and are projected to shatter that record with Christmas again this year. These numbers are referring to Ground and Express only""

""I use to work 8 hour days. Tops. Now its 12 to 13 hour days. Gurantee.""

""Think Christmas type volume but everyday.""

""I've been at this station 18 years and we have never had a busier summer. Crazy. My question is why only a 2% raise? Seems like a step raise would have been more appropriate.""

""The pandemic has also excelled us probably around 2-3 years for progression wise. There won't be any going back to how things are because the main thing is a lot of the older generation that weren't taking advantage of online order etc. Are now doing so and now they realize how easy it actually is to use the internet and so they won't be going back to the way they use to do things and going to the store physically to get most of their products so they will just from now on get them delivered since they now know it's so much easier for them to do and they feel more independent while doing so.""

""FXO checking in. Largely the same story with shipping, printing dropped off, but is picking back up. Xmas busy, 2% raises, shorthanded but the furloughed people are coming back I think this week...at least some of them. So I've been telling people to get the Xmas shopping sent off in November. Xmas this year is going to be an epic shit show.""

""We’ve been a lot busier forsure! But my contractor splits all the routes up so it isn’t so bad on the drivers. Before we would average 80-100 stops now it’s 160-200""

""I'm a package handler switcher on the outbound. we have been busier but we managed to stay caught up in work. I was working 70 hours during peak last year but only working 50 during the pandemic. Though they just told me I have to stay under 45 hours now.""

Seems pretty bullish.

Too poor to enjoy AMZN quarantine tendies but still hungry? UPS will deliver,168,hv6el8,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hv6el8/too_poor_to_enjoy_amzn_quarantine_tendies_but/,90,2020-07-21 17:52:48,"  

UPS has earnings on 7/30 and it should be a good tendie-ing opportunity. Obviously there has been an uptick in the parcel delivery service based on the increase in online shopping due to COVID-19. FedEx, the other big parcel delivery company, had earnings on 6/30 where they reported EPS of $2.53 vs. consensus estimate of $1.42. Revenue was down YoY by 2.5%. This caused share price to jump 12% (140 -> 158) overnight:

At the same time UPS jumped up and has been hovering around the same:

FedEx has a much lower contribution margin per package delivered as they are trying to cut prices to compete against UPS, which is approx. 3x larger anyway.  Anecdotally, I watch the UPS truck pull up to my apartment building and stay for around 30-45mins every day delivering packages, while I see the FedEx truck come maybe 2x a day where the driver will deliver one or two package.  It is my belief the UPS, as the king of logistics, has a much more efficient delivery system which allows more packages to be delivered per trip and thus increases the contribution margin of each package delivered by reducing variable costs related to vehicles and wages.  This is why UPS is going to kill earnings even harder than that guy in the FedEx costume killed that judge.

I personally have 7/31 $125 and 8/7 $125c.

TLDR: Get free money because people are scared to go outside

Edit: Down a bit but I’m not too worried. I was doing a little reading and found that UPS used a fuel surcharge to cover that cost of their business right. But it’s set for a contract period, meaning that there is a lag between fuel prices actually changing and the fuel surcharge being adjusted. I’m thinking since fuel has been cheap across the board since Covid started they are probably making extra bank on their charge. Basically if they’re charging at or near pre covid fuel surcharge but paying nothing for gas should be extra profit"

The Wild $AMZN Ride - How I Bagged $12K in Profits While Y'all Apes Struggled,52,13431x1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/13431x1,43,2023-05-01 02:37:51,"Sup fellow degenerates, gather 'round and let me tell you the tale of how I banked a sweet $12k on $AMZN shares while the rest of you paper-handed fools prob lost stacks or broke even at best. So, buckle up and let's dive into this rollercoaster of a story.

It was earnings week for the tech giants - you know, the likes of $META, $GOOG, and $MSFT. And then, the star of this post: $AMZN. I started building my position back when $FDX beat earnings in March, grabbing 500 shares at a neat $100/share, and then adding another 1000 shares on April 21st just under $107.

Why, you ask? Simple. More packages = Ecommerce boom = analysts being dumbasses. Then, $UPS missed earnings and I decided to drop 500 of my $AMZN shares 'cause your boy ain't about to lose the house over Bezos’ baby.

So, this week was wild. The market had a seizure during trading hours, but then $MSFT & $GOOG reported and it's like we hopped on a rocket straight to the moon. Tech stocks went absolutely bonkers and I caught $MSFT, but that’s for another post.

And then, our Lord and Savior, $META, crushed earnings on Wednesday. Sentiment flip-flopped like a fish out of water. Clearly, these mega-cap stocks were beating expectations and were hella undervalued.

What happened next? Well, the Nasdaq $QQQ went up nearly 3%, and Amazon shot up 4.5% to almost $110. Now, usually, I'd slap on a +5 to +10% call option, but not this time. No siree, I was going in raw hoping I won’t have 18-years bad luck the next morning.

So, $AMZN reported and it just exploded - from $110 to $122 in under 2 minutes. They beat EPS by 50% and revenue by $3 billion. Absolute madness. But, like a true WallStreetBets veteran (check my all-time hottest post), I knew what to do.

An hour later, the earnings call was scheduled. Y'know, where they get into the nitty-gritty and talk about future guidance (aka the mood killer). I figured a 22% gain in a month was more than enough tendies, so I started selling off my shares after-hours. It dipped a bit from the $122 high, but I still came out on top.

And now, the aftermath: $AMZN is sitting at $105.00 - Current position: 4 shares. Feels good, man. Proof of positions and my fat gains below👇

FedEx heading into the shits? Discussion with some DD,60,rekvn0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rekvn0/fedex_heading_into_the_shits_discussion_with_some/,78,2021-12-12 14:12:53,"**TL;DR**

I think FedEx’s earnings are going to tank because of their inability to control costs related to the labor shortages compared to their competition and that you can make tendies on puts or shorts, but this probably won’t be the next DOCU play

**Preface:**

All over the world logistics companies are facing labor shortages and increased shipping loads, on top of the ports being backed up especially a bad thing for courier companies for this quarter since Christmas shopping is in full swing and shopping for tendies online is at an all-time high thanks to covid.

**FedEx’s shipping rate hikes but why I think they mean nothing:**

Last earnings, FedEx announced an increase in rates but it would only take effect on Jan. 3, 2022, these will apply to all US domestic, US export and US import services. FedEx Ground, which delivers to businesses, and FedEx home delivery will increase by an average of 5.9%. FedEx Freight customers could see an increase of up to 7.9%.

Earlier this month starting Nov.1, FedEx also announced that a fuel surcharge will be added to certain FedEx shipments, including FedEx Express, FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight shipments. Effective Nov. 15, 2021, Item 525 Over Length and Item 530 Extreme Length surcharges will also increase.

This rise in rates are always expected due to the build-up of the end of year shipping rush, but I think these rate hikes have come too late as it will only partially offset their fuel costs.

**Labour shortages and increased hiring cost problems:**

Taking data from this news report from Convey a few weeks back:

We can see that FedEx has all along been pretty fucked in terms of their labor problems as this has making them consistently fail in their on-time deliveries. I will explain more on why I think this is relevant below.

Besides the chaos, we still have headlines of FedEx employees dumping packages probably thanks to the insane pile up of packages at this time of the year.

**Flip-side argument from Shipmatrix but why its bullshit**

[Boomer ShipMatrix reports Fedex being on time](https://preview.redd.it/x1xv2viel2581.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0d04a810f359c95c0901d5e5b462a4a83c016837)

Boomer shipmatrix.com disagrees with Convey’s reporting matrix and is instead reporting much better on-time deliveries because they use the total time in transit rather than accounting for when each individual courier receives, processes and then delivers each package.

I wont be going into the specifics here but I personally think ShipMatrix is more retarded than the average WSB autist here.

I don’t know anyone who can even agree with these bullshit numbers that they are pulling out of their ass.

A quick sub-reddit research seems that there’s more chaos over in /r/Fedexers/ vs that of UPS /r/UPSers

**Why do any of these numbers matter?**

Not being able to deliver on time had already led to them losing contracts with time sensitive meal-kit businesses, as noted during its last earnings it lost customers such as Clean Eatz Kitchen Inc. due to delays that cost the company thousands of dollars’ worth of shipments of ready-to-eat frozen meals that ended up spoiled in transit.

Next up on some meal-kit business that will lose or have already lost their contract with Fedex:

1. Home Chef - Users grumbling on facebook & reddit
2. Sun Basket – users are reporting that they have already switched away from Fedex to Courier Express (not a listed company so who cares)

A quick look into any of the meal kit subreddits or a quick google has angry customers complaining about long delays of even up to a week in receiving their meal kits. Can you imagine what happens if you let fresh foodstuff sit in a warehouse with no temperature controls for 3 days, what happens after 5? What happens if that week’s kit has seafood?

Take a look here and you can see nothing but disdain for FedEx in relation to meal kit deliveries.

How many of you personally ordered tendies but they came in late because of FedEx?

Over at the UK side, FedEx is also fucking up on passport deliveries.

**Possibly higher Labor costs vs their peers:**

I remember reading FedEx is also paying more for labor acquisitions than their peers at DHL/UPS/USPS etc but I haven't gone and dug up more about it beyond this news report.

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-04/labor-shortage-ups-union-drivers-give-delivery-service-edge-over-fedex-fdx](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-04/labor-shortage-ups-union-drivers-give-delivery-service-edge-over-fedex-fdx)

**Summary**

FedEx is reporting that they expect higher shipment volume but the increase in revenues wont be high enough to cover their rising costs since they can't even handle the current volume with the current labor shortage. They have also been lagging behind their peers in managing costs possibly leading into an earning's miss and tanking the share price further.

I will likely be picking up puts come market open after I get more allowance from cashing in my good boy points with Mommy.

\*edit\*

Fedex's share price when put against its peers UPS, DHL and Maersk also seems correlated to its poor ability to deliver.

**The Play**

Puts or shorts for potential earnings miss.

\*edit\*

IV pretty low currently so we won't be fucked on option plays

**Risk**

– Share price has already tumbled from its ATH levels of $314 earlier this year. (Currently $246)

– FedEx has other businesses under their arm and this discussion only covers the failings of FedEx Ground

– This may have already been priced into the analyst expected earnings estimates.

Hoping to hear more thoughts about FedEx and if all these are big enough to make FedEx miss its quarterly reports. Especially anyone working under FedEx who can tell me if I’m being retarded"
Time to go all in on FedEx's earnings,20,16nr9pr,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/16nr9pr/time_to_go_all_in_on_fedexs_earnings/,30,2023-09-20 23:02:46,"Guys, it's finally time. [FedEx (FDX) is set to report earnings after close **today**](https://investors.fedex.com/news-and-events/upcoming-events/default.aspx), and they better be good or the stock could be in trouble. One reason our expectations are rising is the labor negotiations at United Parcel Service (UPS) that wrapped up in late August.

Wall Street is looking for earnings per share of $3.71 from sales of $21.7 billion. A year ago, FedEx reported earnings of $3.44 from sales of $23.2 billion.

I'm with most investors and am looking for a beat. One reason is some additional volume that came to FDX from UPS as businesses looked to protect themselves from a potential UPS labor stoppage. About a week ago, UPS “effectively guided 3Q earnings per share 25% below consensus,” wrote [Citi analyst Christian Wetherbee](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-wetherbee-1824aa8a) in a recent report. Higher labor costs as well as shifting volumes were to blame.

That volume goes, partly, to FedEx, pointed out [Raymond James analyst Patrick Tyler Brown](https://www.raymondjames.com/corporations-and-institutions/global-equities-and-investment-banking/equity-research/equity-research-team/bio?id=db7e5eab6cb4412c906934707d72230d&bioListId=e0751245525e45e7a7a2db7f3877a4ce) in a Tuesday report, adding that FedEx stock has also been helped, a little, by the Yellow bankruptcy and its own cost-cutting plant.

Yellow was primarily a less-than-truckload service provider. FedEx also has an LTL business.

All those benefits have pushed up shares about 8% since the company last reported earnings. In June, FedEx reported better-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter earnings, but guidance was light. Management said they expected the company to make between $16.50 and $18.50 a share in fiscal year 2024, up from the almost $15 a share earned in fiscal year 2023. Growth compared with 2023 is positive, but at the time Wall Street was looking for about $18.30 a share.

The weaker-than-hoped-for outlook was a reason shares dropped 2.5% after the report, closing at $224.73. Shares have recovered though, closing Tuesday at just under $250 a share.

Coming into today's trading, shares are up 44% so far this year, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average are up about 16% and 4%, respectively.

The UPS volume shifting might impact one or two quarters at FedEx. Along with a solid fiscal first quarter, investors will want to see positive volume and pricing trends to keep the stock moving higher.

**So I guess the TL;DR is**

1) Increased Volume from UPS: With labor negotiations at UPS causing concerns, some businesses have moved volume to FedEx as a precautionary measure. This could potentially boost FedEx's short-term revenues.

2) Positive Prior Performance: FedEx’s shares have surged about 8% since the company last reported earnings, and its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings were better than expected, which generally signals a positive outlook among investors.

3) Industry Trends: The bankruptcy of Yellow, a less-than-truckload (LTL) service provider, could send more business FedEx's way, as FedEx also has an LTL business.

4) Cost-Cutting Measures: FedEx has its own cost-cutting plan, which could improve profitability if executed well.

5) Year-to-Date Share Growth: FedEx shares have grown 44% this year, significantly outpacing the broader market indexes like the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average. This often indicates strong investor confidence.

So I'll be grabbing 9/22 260c for $3.55 a pop. Wish me luck!"

I've added a few recommendations for earnings after spending most of Friday and Saturday doing DD for next week.**

&#x200B;

Hey y'all! As usual, been swamped with work and research.  Stock picks for last week (and the week before!) were absolute fire. Let's keep it rollin'.  I've received tons of private messages asking for advise, justifications for stock picks, etc. I will try to get to you as soon as I can, but I'm generally much better at replying to the post directly. 

&#x200B;

I usually post (about 20-25) stock picks in the Daily Discussion thread but I do so at very odd hours (usually late at night and on weekends) as I'm swamped with work at more regular hours. My stock recommendations usually rely on in-depth TA and FA, which take some time. I will try posting in the front page more often in the hopes of more tists getting a chance to see the DD. And I will continue with the tradition of posting results for the sake of accountability.

&#x200B;

As usual, I'll recommend puts and calls, and given the positive feedback and success from this weeks' earnings plays, I've devoted some extra time into DD for earnings next week.   


*FOR THE BULLS:*

* Calls: $**TWLO,** $**VRTU**, $**EBAY**, $**COF**, $**FDX**, $**XLNX**, $**OKTA**, $**LULU**, should print good tendies
* BULLISH POWER PLAYS\*\*: $**UBER**, $**SQ**, $**TRIP, $CRWD, $FVRR**
   * If you get CRWD calls, wait for a day or two - at least wait til market close on Monday. The stock will likely pull back some, but after that it will continue its voyage to the moon

*FOR THE BEARS:*

* For the bears: $**MTCH**, $**IBKR**, $**GRUB**, $**SKX**, $**AMBA**
* BEARISH POWER PLAY\*\*:  $**BIDU,** (buy late Monday or Tuesday), **$CMG** (sell before earnings for safe play, sell after earnings if you want to yolo NFLX style); **$HSY** (sell before earnings)

*EARNINGS*:

* EARNINGS CALLS: $**BIIB; $GOOGL; $PYPL;** $**FB** (easy peasy, though I would buy on Tuesday at market open); 
* EARNINGS PUTS: $**HLT;** $**BA** (don't buy tomorrow. Buy right before earnings), 

*For the broke breddas:*

* Penny stock of the week: $**OTLK**

\*\*Power plays, in my books, are riskier/less certain plays with potential to print plenty more $. Buy at your own risk, of course.

UPS all-in because... [DD],129,j50vku,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j50vku/ups_allin_because_dd/,76,2020-10-04 21:06:52,"# “Better, not bigger”

Carole Tome new CEO has stated “better, not bigger” as the new motto for UPS. Profitability is the name of the game for UPS as it’s shipping volume is already exorbitant. 

Starting August 30, price increase of 30%

for shipping out of mainland China and Hong Kong. 

Starting aug 30, US worldwide expedited surcharges will be more than double what they were in April. 

Surcharges from Tawain, Vietnam, Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, and others to the US are up 30% beginning Aug 30. 

Why that’s important? 

UPS operating profit grew 7.4% year over year largely due to international travel. 

Volume Increase of 46% out of Asia. Meanwhile, last quarter domestic profitability decreased...

**What about domestic profitability?**

Domestic profitability will increase over the following quarter. Surcharges are coming! $1 for ground and $2 for air at least. Reports for up to $4-$5 surcharges for peak shipping starting November going into January. These increases bode well for a shift to increase domestic profitability and align well with an important season. 

**Holiday season and E-commerce**

Deloitte reports an increase of 25-35% increase in e-commerce over the holiday season. I think that’s quite modest. 

A recent online survey by Redpoint Global found 62% or respondents planned to do ALL their holiday shopping online. Factor this is with the UPS surcharges and big profits are imminent. 

**UPS and EBay** 

A little under the radar, EBay and UPS announced a deal to provide discounted shipping opportunities when using UPS. eBay is trying to shift away from USPS curing many delays and elected to aim that focus on UPS. 

**Anything else?** 

The vaccine. When it’ll be ready, who knows? When it is, UPS is the only major transporter that has certified storage capabilities to transport vaccines at the necessary temperature. It’s partnership within Operation Warp Speed is bullish. Did you see what that money did to all vaccine stocks? 

UPS is in a unique position as it benefitted from COVID’s initial chaos, has continued to benefit throughout due to the e-commerce shift and strong Asian demand, and will continue to benefit from the holiday season and vaccine distribution. If you need more proof look at various retail players who benefitted off the e-commerce and Asian demand shift such as Nike. Nike showed decline nationally but gained in the Chinese market. Most importantly, Nike showed an 82% increase in Online sales. 

**Don’t believe me? Trust the analyst.** 

Keybanc recently raised to Buy with a price target of $190. Credit Suissie raised target to $192. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

***TLDR: UPS is increasing profitability.*** 

***Surcharges everywhere. EBay partnership. Plus, even more surcharges for holidays. Did we mention vaccine shipment? How about e-commerce boom?  Price analysts agree.***"

UPS calls for October 16th look S3XY,48,i98tag,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i98tag/ups_calls_for_october_16th_look_s3xy/,96,2020-08-14 03:03:57,"EDIT: HUGE CATALYST: https://twitter.com/livesquawk/status/1301256506160144384?s=21

Ok shitbags, listen up. I’m looking at UPS $200c 10/16. Did some DD on this that I can share. Earnings just happened and you saw the pop after, same story with Fedex. COVID is real good for the shipping business. You saw FDX just hit over $200 and was $170 a week ago. UPS trading around $160 and will keep climbing as well. 

- UPS is Raising rates on shipping this fall and during the holiday season. Higher rates, higher revenue. See https://abc7chicago.com/business/ups-to-add-surcharge-for-companies-shipping-large-quantities/6365412/ - they’ll be adding surcharges to keep up with shipping demand. Don’t forget about inflation happening too. 
- This particular call will expire roughly 11 days before their next earnings. Now they have not officially announced their next earnings date, but based on prior estimates, it will be around the 27th of October. Therefore if it doesn’t hit $200 before October 1, there should still be a nice run up first 2 weeks of October leading up to earnings. 
- Amazon partner (FDX is not) for shipping. Obviously we all know how amazon has been doing this pandemic. They are friendly competitors in a sense, as amazon does their own shipping yet they can’t replace UPS... yet. At some point that will come down, but I don’t see this partnership ending in the next 1-2 years. It’s kind of like having a roommate you hate, but have to live with until your lease ends. 
- calls are extremely low downside at .50. If you can’t afford a $50 call, you shouldn’t be trading. 
- IV is 56% at the moment, it has calmed down quite a bit since earnings, now is a good time to buy with lower IV.

Transportation and delivery stocks took a hit last March when the disruption of pandemic came. Almost one year later they have recovered strongly. Staying at home and working from home have created unprecedented demand for transportation and delivery of goods via vehicles on highways. As the vaccination looms and the economy reopens, the demand might drop, but the habits nurtured during the pandemic could linger for quite a while. I am still cautious about airline stocks; air travel is still far from recovering even 1/3 of what it was before the pandemic and I won’t make a move until the volume reaches about 1/2 . 

Looking at: PAG, KSU, UPS, FDX, UBER, UNP

2 More traditional/” big players” financial stocks

I have opened another post asking for advice, so I will just be copying and pasting:

Fintech stocks and ETFs are popular on the market nowadays and I’ve reaped quite some profits from ARKF, PYPL, SQ, V, virtual currency ETFs e.t.c. But now I am eyeing in on the more traditional/big Wall Street players like Citibank, JPM, Morgan Stanley, Goldman e.t.c. All flaws and blames and crooked behaviors aside, they are still the biggest players in the financial market nowadays and the establishment can’t be overwhelmed by a few Reddit short squeezes. I am trying to observe if these stocks could sort of ""recover"" from the shock and respond to the innovative trend.

There’s also another realm of more diversified asset management player such as CG, BX, BLK, NTRS e.t.c. It seems the pandemic has a very strong asset/wealth reallocation effects and the wealthiest that could afford to have their assets managed by these players are doing well. These institutions also typically have quite established footings in emerging markets such as Asia and South America in both government and private businesses. CG has recently published a pleasant Q4 2020 report and their stocks climbed. I am waiting to see if BX, BLK and NTRS would follow suit.

Looking at: JPM, BX, BLK, NTRS, CG, BAM

3 Military and Defense

The mainstream media tries hard to paint a layer of peaceful color to the new administration, but tensions around the globe won’t just disappear. The US military has quite a few major contracts for new weapon systems delivery coming up, and US arms sales to allies could increase as many of them are located at the forefronts of tensions (Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Saudi, India e.t.c).

Looking at: LDOS, LMT, GD, NOC, BA (more for its military contracts rather than for commercial airplanes)

======

4 Tech Infrastructures

With everything shifting to online platform, Tech stocks (IT, cloud computing, semiconductors e.t.c.) have done well in 2020. I am in MSFT and TSM, and I just want to take a look at stocks that offer a more infrastructural exposure to the tech advancements, such as base towers for 5G, solutions for cloud computing and online platforms, workstations, hardware production e.t.c.

Looking at: CCI, AMT, CSCO, MSI, ERIC

5 Virtual Currency

I am not a big fan of virtual currencies so far, and it might be a bit late to enter the game. but nobody could deny the soaring prices of every major virtual currency, and I certainly don’t mind to ride the bandwagon and get a few extra bucks.

**First Post:**

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kuwg1e/i\_have\_a\_discount\_trading\_bot\_which\_gives\_out/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kuwg1e/i_have_a_discount_trading_bot_which_gives_out/)

&#x200B;

**Background:**

* My discount bot to help /r/wallstreetbets. It took me almost a year to develop it to my standard.
* My private codes was used to develop it, and it's very unlikely I will sell it off to anyone or publish the code freely as it took me way too long to develop it. I rather post updates freely, at no cost to anyone than give out the code.
* I will not be posting this hourly. It just too long to load everything up maybe in the future. I will post during open though.
* Discord and telegram admins, don't try to monetize my bot suggestions to vulnerable people, when you don't even own the codes behind it.
* There are a lot of SPY500/""boomer"" companies within the bot, I thought about removing it but many people preferred that I kept it in there.
* There won't be any sell signals, as stocks only go up, so I rather just do a discount algorithm.
* Batch 1 = Algorithm/Bot + Human Judgement
* Batch 2 = Algorithm/Bot Judgement Only
* This is a one man bot.

&#x200B;

**Bot Overview**:

It's showing an opportunity that you may have missed otherwise, so you can decide for yourself if you want to pursue the discount of a stock for potential profits.

&#x200B;

**Key:**

* Pharma companies are very risky.
* Meme/Hype stocks are very risky.
* Companies that you don't know how they work are very risky.
* Follower companies are very risky because they join the hype train (what NKLA is to TSLA).
* I have a very low amount in options (less than $500), and I have 100k+ in shares and cash.
* When doing options have a lot of collateral, so you don't hit margin call.
* Take the ""Calls"" as very discounted, and ""Potentially A Call"" as somewhat discounted.
* Old money companies are slow. While tech companies are fast-paced.
* Only invest in companies that you do know and see potential in.
* You don't have to invest every day, only when you see the potential.

Greetings you filthy animals! I'm the guy who made this [Inverse Cramer Index](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uiipwu/this_is_actually_beating_the_sp_by_over_30_for/) (which is beating the S&P by 20% YTD, not to brag...). I asked what you wanted to see next in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ujt0lx/i_built_the_inverse_cramer_index_what_should_i_do/), and the top comment was a portfolio invested in stocks mentioned on South Park. So I sent my wife out for a nice date night with her boyfriend and got to work.

&#x200B;

**The Question**

Could a portfolio that invests in stocks when they're mentioned on South Park actually be a viable investment strategy?

&#x200B;

[Or is it?](https://i.redd.it/uw8lbkyqz1z81.gif)

**The Data**

I originally used the South Park Fandom site to brute force scrape every episode script in search of company names listed in the NYSE/NASDAQ database. This picked up a lot of shit and even missed a few obvious ones, like a mention of Campbells Soup in the 2015 episode Red Man's Greed. I needed a different way to get all the data. I hit the jackpot on Wikipedia when I found they have a summary of every episode, complete with a list of references made. I wrote a script to pull the ticker symbols associated with the company names, along with each episode air date. We were in business.

&#x200B;

**The Strategy**

Being mentioned in the episode was our buy signal, so we just needed to test the right time to sell. I played around with a few investment windows - 30 days, 60, 120, 360 - but nothing looked all that impressive. I decided to try a more aggressive approach, completely selling previous holdings as soon as the next company mention occurred. This makes us entirely beholden to South Park as our stock picker, which for some reason is what we want...

South Park. Fucking. Destroys. Of course it does because nothing makes sense. Our South Park strategy returned 1100% over the past 7 years, compared to 200% for the S&P 500. This boils down to a 50% CAGR over the past 7 years with a Sharpe ratio of about 1.4. Not too bad. Now, keep in mind that this strategy basically boiled down to ""buy Build a Bear and $VIAC during the pandemic."" But gains are gains and this strategy fucking worked. So cheers WSB, you're 2 for 2 on meme strats!

**Conclusion**

Idk man... I guess just go with what you feel? If this works then who am I or anyone else to tell you a strategy is dumb. If you put a bunch of time in and do your DD you'll probably lose money. If you think your bowl of Cheerios is telling you to buy Realty Income Corp (look it up) then it'll probably be a winner. Up is down, and Cartman should be hosting Mad Money (which I think he did once, right?)

Despite losing my grip on reality a little, this was really fun! Let me know what strategy I should test next!

P.S. Don't ask me where to invest in this. Find it yourself."

Not only that, but in February they are down in revenue, income, EPS, and more,

Hi, I read a lot of posts telling me I should have sold because the volatility drops or something? I did some jogging today and I saw a Fedex truck on my way out, and on my way back I saw an even bigger Fedex truck leaving a building. I thought to myself I should hold my calls it was a sign from tendie heaven. But it looks like the volatility will be going down, and I'm not sure if I can sell at open or hold, I just feel like I'm fucked. Also look at the graph of my portfolio, I never let go of them... I should have sold when it was at it's peak but I was greedy and had diamond hands... :("

On the other hand General Mills is in charge of numerous consumption products that are sold through many grocery and stationary stores across the country and the world over. However, unlike other stay at home stock it hasn't seen the same rate of growth as others, and isn't a ""sure thing"" as a result.

Both these corporations hve  earnings tomorrow and I'm wondering which you believe is the more realistic stock to choose that will most likely give a decent or greater ROI."

#Trading Update

*   What’s happening this morning? Things are pretty quiet (once again). The China Aug eco
data came in soft and that weighed on Asian equities and is placing mild pressure on
Eurozone stocks and US S&P futures (S&P futures are down only 1-2 points). Most of the
major Asian indices ended lower although there were some pockets of green: TPX -0.32%,
NKY -0.29%, Hang Seng -0.42%, SHCOMP -0.38%, Taiwan +0.2%, KOSPI +0.74%, Australia -
0.1%, and India was flattish. Korea was bolstered by tech (Samsung Electronics +1.37%,
Hynix +1.45%, LG Display +2.74%, etc.). The major Eurozone indices are trading off small;
the SXPP basic resources index is down >1% off China but otherwise there aren’t any other
major sources of softness while media and retail are upside standouts (retail is being helped
by the Next PLC news). The SNB tweaked its FX language in a slightly more hawkish
direction, calling the CHF “highly valued” instead of “significantly overvalued”. Overall the
broader macro narrative isn’t shifting dramatically despite China (in fact some see a silver
lining in the data as this could make the gov’t more inclined to pursue growth-friendly
policies). There were a ton of tax articles in the US but the outlook for that topic remains
unchanged (the GOP blueprint is due out during the week of 9/25). The week’s last major
(scheduled) catalyst hits at 8:30amET this morning (US Aug CPI) while next week’s main
focus is the FOMC decision (Wed 9/20; the messaging around a Dec hike may be more
hawkish than the market currently assumes).
*   Calendar for Thurs 9/14 – the focus will be on the BOE rate decision (7amET), the US CPI for
Aug (8:30amET), Thy God Emperor Trump ’s trip to Florida, some analyst meetings (ANSS and GKOS), earnings
(JBL and ORCL after the close), and sell-side conferences (Goldman Communacopia, Morgan
Stanley Laguna, and RBC Industrials).
o US CPI Thurs morning – the latest leg of the SPX rally has been spurred by proreflation
forces as risk sentiment welcomed firmer inflation numbers (in China,
India, Sweden, and the UK). Thus the US CPI (due out Thurs morning 8/14 at
8:30amET) needs to be at least inline (the St is modeling headline +0.3% M/M and
core +0.2% M/M) and mild upside would likely be a net positive. Too much inflation
though risks unsettling sentiment and if the Thurs CPI causes 12/13 FOMC FF hike
odds to spike back >50% that would likely be met w/equity pressure.
*   Calendar for Fri 9/15 – the focus will be on the Eurozone trade balance for Jul (5amET), the
US Empire Manufacturing index for Sept (8:30amET), US retail sales for Aug (8:30amET), US
industrial production for Aug (9:15amET), US Michigan confidence numbers for Sept
(10amET), US business inventories for Jul (10amET), and sell-side conferences (Morgan
Stanley Laguna).

#Top Headlines for Thursday

*   Economic data/monetary policy recap for Thurs 9/14 – there was a lot of data out this
morning. The China data was soft and as a result JPMorgan is revising lower Q3 GDP
forecasts for the country (see the full note: http://bit.ly/2x226Wk). IP for Aug came in at
+6% (vs. JPM and the St +6.6%), retail sales rose 10.1% (vs. JPM +10.2% and the St +10.5%),
and FAI climbed 7.8% YTD as of Aug (vs. JPM +8.3% and the St +8.2%). We revise down our
current quarter growth forecast to 6.2%q/q saar (previously 6.6%q/q saar), or 6.7%oya
(previously 6.8%oya). Meanwhile, we maintain our 4Q17 forecast at 6.2%q/q saar (or 6.6%
in yoy terms), and the full-year growth forecast stays unchanged at 6.8%. Elsewhere on the
economic front, Australian jobs data for Aug was solid although the UR held steady at 5.6%
(http://bit.ly/2jpRH3x) and Eurozone new auto registration growth accelerated in Aug to
+5.6% (vs. +2.7% in Jul). The SNB tweaked its CHF language and said the recent weakening
""is helping to reduce, to some extent, the significant overvaluation of the currency""
(previously the SNB has lamented the CHF’s “significant overvaluation”
http://bit.ly/2eXuwIC). ECB’s Jan Smets said Eurozone inflation appears to have bottomed
out (http://nyti.ms/2f8nynT). Greece said it would exceed prior primary budget surplus
targets for this year (http://reut.rs/2x2RxUq).

Thy God Emperor Trump  has displayed a willingness to work w/Democrats.
o Thy God Emperor Trump  is extremely eager for a “win” after months of failure and if that requires
him to work w/Democrats, so be it. “We learned this summer that keeping 50 or

o Fresh off striking a three-month fiscal deal with “Chuck and Nancy”, Thy God Emperor Trump  agreed
Wed night to work w/Democrats on a DACA/Dreamers compromise. Thy God Emperor Trump ’s
outreach to Dems on immigration represents a “major political gamble” as this topic
was the centerpiece of his campaign. Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa), an immigration
hard-liner and early Thy God Emperor Trump  supporter, wrote that if reports of a potential
immigration deal are accurate, the president’s “base is blown up, destroyed,
irreparable, and disillusioned beyond repair. No promise is credible” – Washington
Post http://wapo.st/2y81heI
*   Taxes – Republicans are pushing forward w/an aggressive tax timeline (a blueprint is due
out during the week of 9/25) but the overall plan remains inchoate.
o “Thy God Emperor Trump  urges quick action on tax plan that’s still in pieces” – the NYT notes that
while there is a lot of eagerness for action on the tax front, Republicans are far from
aligned on the details and a path through Congress isn’t apparent at the moment.
NYT http://nyti.ms/2jpuApI
o GOP “shudders” as Thy God Emperor Trump  courts Dems on taxes – Republican leaders in Congress

*   Russia’s war games sparks NATO alarm – Russia and Belarus are holding massive war games
in what will be the largest display of Russian military power since the end of the Cold War.
NATO and the West in general are worried that Russia is moving far more troops into
Belarus than it intends to withdraw, establishing a permanent military presence in the
country. Some are concerned that Moscow will use the exercise as cover for a more
aggressive act (such as when Russia used exercises in ’14 to prepare for its annexation of
Crimea). NYT http://nyti.ms/2vUXBLV

*   Volatility spike coming? The NYT profiles a hedge fund positioning for a large spike in
volatility. http://nyti.ms/2eWeJd5
*   Company-specific news from Thurs morning 9/14. There are a few notable items in
Europe. Next PLC shares are the top performing stock in the SXXP after raising its full-year
earnings guidance. GVC Holdings also has a post-earnings bid. GKN PLC is higher following
mgmt. changes. Autoliv shares are spiking ~8% after the co said it would pursue a split. On
the downside, Morrison Supermarkets is leading on the SXXP on the downside after
reporting while Experian is getting hit following the credit agency sell-off in the US on Wed.
Hermes shares are weak after the co warned that a strong euro would weigh on financial
results (the Hermes news was discussed in this article http://bit.ly/2y7L0q7). Munich Re is
holding in well despite issuing a profit warning related to the US hurricanes.
*   Company-specific news from Wed night 9/13. There weren’t any major micro headlines.
Munich Re (right before the US close on Wed) said the US hurricanes could cause it to post a
loss in CQ3 and miss prior full-year guidance. BZH said new home sales/closings may be
down Y/Y in its FQ4 as a result of the hurricanes but its overall tone stayed sanguine. EMR
reported Aug underlying orders up a relatively healthy 9% (although mgmt. said
Harvey/Irma had a neg. impact on business results towards the end of Aug and into Sept).
The White House formally blocked the LSCC buyout (which isn’t a shock as CFIUS had
already recommended scrapping the transaction). THC is exploring options, including a sale,
according to a WSJ article. UNFI posted small EPS upside and CDNS named a new CFO.
*   AAPL – iPhone carrier discounts muted following the 8/X introductions on Tues – wireless
carriers during prior iPhone cycles have been extremely aggressive in offering promotions
and discounts but this time around the industry is staying (relatively) disciplined. Deals for
the iPhone 8, 8 Plus and X have been pared back from the deals offered for the iPhone 7 –

*   EQT, RICE – DE Shaw is pushing for EQT to complete the RICE deal but then wants to see the
combined company pursue a break-up (this contrasts w/Jana which wants to see EQT call off
the RICE deal all together) – WSJ. http://on.wsj.com/2vVe56N
*   ALV to pursue split – the co said it aims to split into two companies under a strategic review
announced on Thursday. Reuters http://nyti.ms/2y7O8Cj

#Calendar of events to watch for the week of Mon Sept 18

*   Calendar for the week of 9/18 – the main focus will be the FOMC decision (Wed 9/20).
Balance sheet normalization is widely expected to commence coming out of this meeting
but the bigger near-term wildcard will be messaging around a Dec hike (the Fed will likely
suggest odds for a 12/13 hike that are higher than present market assumptions). The other
big area of focus will be on the data front w/the flash PMI readings for Sept from Japan,
Europe, and the US hitting Fri morning 9/22. The press will stay filled w/tax-related
articles as Republicans gear up for publication of their blueprint (the GOP is set to unveil
their tax plan during the week of Mon 9/25). The UN annual meeting kicks off in NYC on
Tues 9/19 (Thy God Emperor Trump  speaks 9/19); US officials will apparently hold talks on the sidelines of this

permits at 8:30amET), analyst meetings (AIR Canada, BA, BBY, BIG, and CARB), and earnings

*   Calendar for Wed 9/20 – the focus will be on US existing home sales for Aug (10amET), the

meetings (PPC), and earnings (GIS pre-open and MLHR after the close).
*   Calendar for Thurs 9/21 – the focus will be on the BOJ decision (Wed night/Thurs morning),
the ECB economic bulletin (4amET), US FHFA home prices for Jul (9amET), the US Leading

earnings (MANU pre-open and PSDO, YOGA after the close).

* **Historical Move v Implied Move:** We determine the historical volatility (log variance of daily gains) of the underlying asset (HV) and compare that to the current implied volatitlity (IV) of the option price. This is used to determine the Call or Put Premium.
* **Expiration:** 2023-05-26.
* **Call/Put Pricing:** How much extra you are paying for IV relative to HV. Low numbers mean ""cheaper."" High numbers mean ""expensive."" A 1 means ""fairly"" priced.
* **Efficiency:** This the bid/ask spreads and the depth of the order book relative to the price and approximates the cost of a round trip trade. Lower numbers are less efficient than higher numbers.
* **E.R.:** Days unitl the next Earnings Release.
* **Direction:** This ranges from -100 (bearish) to +100 (bullish). It accounts for RSI, trend, moving averages and put/call skew over the past 4 weeks.
* **Why isn't my stock on this list?** It doesn't have ""weeklies"", the underlying is ""too cheap"", or the options markets are too illiquid (open interest) to qualify for this strategy. 480 underlyings are used in this report and only the top results end up passing the criteria for each filter.
* **How should this be improved?** Do you have any suggestions or notice any bugs with this report?"
UPs for UPS (A WSB DD that's actually not retarded),37,jg6etj,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jg6etj/ups_for_ups_a_wsb_dd_thats_actually_not_retarded/,56,2020-10-23 00:47:40,"There is an influx of retarded DD's being posted and not too many good ones in that haystack. HAHA ,[you work for QQQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jg2uik/i_work_for_qqq/)  and the retards there tell you it's only going up. This is also not just a copy and pasted [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jg372e/pton_peloton_downgraded_short_this_shit_now/) flaired as DD. So I present to you a half decent DD that's not [shit](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jfrlfu/ko_finna_go_tits_up/)

Alright lets get straight to the point. If you listened to [My last DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hpqwqv/calls_on_tsn/) you would’ve easily hit a 5-7 bagger. So why should you listen to me again? Here’s my case for why you should go big on UPS earnings.

UPS is primed for its best quarter ever. Analysts are giving extremely conservative estimates that just make this the perfect set up for a big beat. Estimated EPS for this quarter is $1.80. That’s an estimated drop of 15% from the previous quarter! Now let’s take a look at Q3 from the previous 2 years. The EPS for Q3 in 2019 and 2018 were $2.07 and $1.82. So analysts are saying UPS will underperform those 2 quarters during the year of COVID? I’d be willing to take a bet against that any day of the week. Below is a table with the results of the last 8 earnings and the price action that followed. UPS’s stock price usually reacts pretty accurately with its earnings results. Yes the market has a mind of its own and anything can happen but previous instances say that if EPS beats the stock will positively react to it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**So what catalysts point towards a big beat?**

Let’s get the obvious out of the way first. People are stuck at home due to COVID and e-commerce has boomed because of it. No need to elaborate more on this

&#x200B;

[**Better not Bigger**](https://spendmanagementexperts.com/blog/strong-second-quarter-as-ups-focuses-on-being-better-not-bigger/) is the new UPS motto. CEO Tome has stated that profitability is UPS’s number one priority. How do they plan on doing this? Well an increase in surcharges is one way. US worldwide expedited charges have gone up 30%. why is this important? Well Asia outbound volume had an increase of 46% q/q and every other major region went up at least double digits. There will be similar volume expected this quarter. So here is the thing about that 30% surcharge. It was put in place this quarter so if volume stays the same you can expect a substantial increase in revenue.

**So here’s a bit of my own personal DD.**

I see a UPS guy at work twice a day every day. I work in Miami so we can all agree it’s a pretty prime location. Since around July they’ve been telling me every day is hectic and it’s like a pre-Christmas work day. But there’s more to this than just an increase in volume. With everyone working at home, UPS drivers can no longer step into a building and deliver their x amount of packages to every employee. Now each individual employee has deliveries made to their house. Is UPS still charging the same for the business class delivery fees? You bet your ass they’re not. Shipping rates have gone up and there are more shipments to be made.

**Value > Growth**

I’m sure you’ve heard lots of analysts including everyone’s favorite [Goldman Sachs](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/15/goldman-sachs-says-its-time-to-buy-value-stocks-and-sell-some-tech.html) mention how now is the time to switch from growth stocks to value stocks? Well with elections coming up, this is the thing many investors will do. Regardless of who wins the presidency UPS will be one of the least affected stocks. With no vaccine in site this only helps its case. Let’s take a quick look at this chart representing the average returns from growth/value stocks after election day since 1980.

**How about everyone’s favorite two earnings words…** ***FORWARD GUIDANCE***\*\*?\*\*

Well UPS is expecting its busiest holiday season ever. They plan to [hire over 100,000](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lisettevoytko/2020/09/09/ups-hiring-100000-workers-as-retailers-anticipate-whopping-holiday-shipping-season/#8c4acae63b92) workers for next quarter and will most likely see its highest revenue of all time. This holiday season will be all e-commerce. Black Friday will become Cyber Friday. There will be less holiday traveling and more holiday shipping. People will be shipping their presents they ordered off [EBay](https://www.ebayinc.com/stories/news/ebay-teams-up-with-ups-r-to-offer-new-shipping-options-on-its-marketplace/) this year. This will be the busiest quarter in the company’s history and if the new CEO keeps its promise of “Better not Bigger” UPS will once again smash earnings.

**So how should I play this?**

Before we get into that lets take a look at FDX’s last 2 earnings. On 06/30 (Q2) FDX beat estimated eps by 78% and gapped up at open 11.7% at open. Just like FDX, UPS beat its Q2 estimates eps at over 99%. UPS gapped up 10% following those results. FDX Q3 beat estimated eps by 81% and gapped up 7%. UPS is announcing its Q3 earnings next week so let’s hope for a similar result.

A realistic bullish case is an 8% swing up after earnings. Who knows what the price will be the day before, but if it stays flat ($175) we’re looking at about $190.

&#x200B;

TL:DR UPS

11/20 $180C $190C.

10/30 $185 or $190C but wait closer til earnings before pulling the trigger

04/16/2021 $200C If you want to play both earnings. (Premium is looking pretty cheap)"
"Insider Trading Weekly Update #021: Execs Dump $ADP, $NVCR, $AZO, $DDOG; Largest Trades + Sector and Market Cap Overviews From The Past Week",74,1095qtf,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1095qtf/insider_trading_weekly_update_021_execs_dump_adp/,16,2023-01-11 19:45:22,"GM,

**TL;DR** \- **Deep. Red.** Outside of \~$11M in open market purchases, the lion’s share of insider trading was sales, which are up about 300% week-over-week. The drop in buying isn’t due to lack of filings - those rose to 569 (+143%) from the week of December 30th.

Below are notable buys from insiders:

* Jack Hightower, the CEO (and 10% owner) of Highpeak Energy, Inc ($HPK / Energy), increased his stake by 4.74% with a $2.89M purchase on Jan 4th
* Roxanne Austin, a director at Crowdstrike Holdings ($CRWD / Software), **increased her ownership by 53.5%** with a $3.36M purchase on Jan 5th.
* Amy Lane, a director a FedEx Corp ($FDX / Industrials), increased her position by 22.42% with a $49.2K purchase on Jan 3rd
* Thomson Leighton, the CEO of Akami Technologies, increased their position by 20% with a $75K purchase on Jan 4th

And some notable sales from insiders:

* Carlos Rodriguez, the Executive Chair of Automatic Data Processing ($ADP / IT Sector) **sold his entire position** with a $26.3M sale on January 4th
* Asas Danziger, the CEO of Novocure Ltd ($NVCR / Health Care), **sold 93.25% of their position** with a $20.25M sale on Jan 5th
* Phillip Daniele, an Executive Vice President at Autozone Inc ($AZO / Consumer Discretionary) **sold 97.26% of his position** with a \~$10.6M sale on Jan 4th
* Alexis Le-Quoc, the President & CTO of Datadog ($DDOG), decreased their stake by 28.46% with a $4.96M sale on Jan 4th

# High-Level Stats:

* Purchases decreased from $35.8M to $10.9M (-70%)
* Sales increased from $183M to $729M (+299%)
* Transactions increased from 234 to 569 (+143%)
* Companies represented in Form 4s increased from 150 to 289 (+93%)
   * Net buyers decreased from 28 to 19 (-32%)
   * Net sellers increased from 122 to 270 (+121%)
* Insiders filing Form 4s increased from 205 to 501 (+144%)
   * Net buyers decreased from 51 to 31 (-39%)
   * Net sellers increased from 154 to 470 (+205%)

# Transaction Selection

1. **All** **Open Market Transactions** from **January 3rd - January 6th.** These are Form 4 filings with a Transaction Code of “P” or “S”. This narrows the scope to trades where insiders are putting their money on the line.
2. **Both indirect and direct** transactions are included in the reports.
3. Weekly comparisons are to transactions from **December 26th - December 30th.**
4. **No companies without a ticker** (e.g. opportunity/income/mutual funds).
5. No penny stocks or banned tickers.

# Further Context

1. Form 4 data is impacted by a concept known as **backfill** which is par for the course with transactional data. The delay between the Filing Date and the Transaction Date is **\*roughly\*** 2 days and your mileage will vary. This means that **more transactions for past dates can arrive in future filings.** That is why looking at larger trends is key.
2. To combat backfill, filings through this Tuesday are included **\*if\*** the transaction date is from the prior week. Otherwise, transactions from this week are excluded.
3. Data is sourced by algos behind [Form Fore](http://formfore.io/)

# Updates(!)

1. We are rolling out new content on our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/FormFore) page later today. At the moment this provides more granular stats from the latest week of Insider Trading. Stay toon'd.
2. As mentioned last week, the Form Fore beta is currently closed. Feel free to message me about the waitlist as ramping up accessibility is next on our roadmap.

UPS Earnings Beat?,11,jj5neu,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jj5neu/ups_earnings_beat/,64,2020-10-27 23:01:53,"Last earnings report UPS blew expectations out of the water with an expected EPS of $1.07 and reported of $2.13.  UPS gapped up ~12% afterwards.

Current estimates for this earnings are at ~$1.82.  It seems safe to anticipate a beat on that, but the question is how much?  The stock hasn't gone up much after last earnings, as it reached $160 a week after previous earnings and is now sitting at $170.  

However, I think its unrealistic to expect a large gap up at this point, everyone knows UPS is doing well now, and it will be harder for them to completely CRUSH those expectations and surprise investors.

Anyone holding through earnings?"
$COTY. Masks Off. Cosmetic Demand SOARING. Profits On. Reopening play still at a discount.,41,o7e5e2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o7e5e2/coty_masks_off_cosmetic_demand_soaring_profits_on/,45,2021-06-25 07:37:02,"**TLDR:** Mask mandates around the world are being lifted. The need for cosmetics (it expires) is going to soar as normalcy returns and women leave their homes without a mask. $COTY is number one manufacturer of fragrances and number 4 for colored cosmetics in the world amidst a massive company turn around along with early inning expansion into Asia and e-commerce. Still at 15% discount to pre-covid price and 60%+ upside from current price to recent upgrade to $15 target ($9.50 today). IE your wife's bf is going to buy her perfume and makeup so she is more tolerable to look at, Coty options are the play I own Jan 23 $10c and Jan 22 $8C, the latter I owned for awhile now. Do not buy weeklies, longer dated options aren't expensive and are the play.

I've done two DD's here in the past, one for FDX calls last ER that printed 50%+ gains ([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m2d4sh/fdx\_delivering\_you\_tendiesmassive\_upside\_going/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m2d4sh/fdx_delivering_you_tendiesmassive_upside_going/)) and the second was $SNOW puts that printed 150% plus gains ([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kina26/snow\_massive\_dilution\_incoming\_easy\_put/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kina26/snow_massive_dilution_incoming_easy_put/)).

My third DD is going to be on $COTY, a reopening play that is still at a discount, isn't a meme stock and has nothing to do with shorts or pants or squeezes.

$COTY is one of the largest manufactures in the world for the beauty industry (manufacturer all Gucci cosmetics), they are number one for fragrances and number 4 for colored cosmetics. Prior to COVID this company was an absolute nightmare. As you would expect, when COVID hit the price was crushed, it has been slowly climbing back during COVID but the best is yet ahead. Price is STILL 15% LOWER than it was pre-covid and LEAP options here are very cheap (positions at end).

Mask mandates have been lifted here in the US, most recently here in CA, people are openly out not wearing their masks. Mask mandates are now being lifted in Europe, most recently:

Spain:[https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/spain-scrap-mandatory-outdoor-masks-june-26-2021-06-18/](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/spain-scrap-mandatory-outdoor-masks-june-26-2021-06-18/)

Italy: [https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/6/22/italy-to-lift-mandatory-masks-outdoors-as-pandemic-slows](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/6/22/italy-to-lift-mandatory-masks-outdoors-as-pandemic-slows)

Switzerland: [https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/swiss-accelerate-reopening-allow-large-events-with-covid-certificates-2021-06-23/](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/swiss-accelerate-reopening-allow-large-events-with-covid-certificates-2021-06-23/)

As these mask mandates are lifted, more women will be leaving their home and be seen without a mask. All makeup expires and the demand for makeup and perfume is going to SKYROCKET as women re-enter society.

Compared to peers like Rev that are much more expensive than COTY, this is a nice play in the space. I own Jan 2023 $10C and Jan 2022 $8C, the latter I have owned since earlier this year. My personal opinion is that this should hit $15 early next year  ($9.50 today), which for options would be 200-300% returns, this is not a stock to play weeklies on.

Right prior to COVID, they hired a new CEO Sue Nabi.  She has an incredible track record of success with spending over 20 years at L'Oreal and eventually became their youngest CEO in their 110 company history. In 2009, she joined Lancome – leading the brand to three years of up-to-double-digit growth and a record turnover of $3.2B. Her team and her also have extensive digital sales experience ,which **Coty** was lacking prior but will be significant as they continue to expand their global brand presence. Prior to her, there was high CEO turnover and poor management team which was reflected in the declining stock price and creates an opportunity for more upside with the new CEO. In addition, prior to Sue they had a significant amount of debt and their brands along with margins were awful, hence the declining price before COVID. She has made it a focus now to reduce debt (big sale to KKR earlier this year), substantially improve margins, cost cutting and focusing on more prestige brands. Her transformation to enter the Asian Market and build an much better e-commerce presence leave substantial room for growth. Lastly she has been quickly changing the board to bring on more industry experts.

The four talking points below are from : [https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/4-reasons-coty-could-surprise-the-naysayers-2021-06-17](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/4-reasons-coty-could-surprise-the-naysayers-2021-06-17), this gives a bit more insight into Coty.

## 1. Costs are dropping, margins rising

Reining in expenses and boosting gross margin are both signs Coty is likely executing well on its strategic transformation, with top- and bottom-line improvements slightly lagging. Gross margin jumped 450 basis points year over year, reaching 62.2%, with CFO Laurent Mercier stating that regarding ""the gross margin improvement delivered this quarter, we are confident that approximately half is structural, and therefore, can be maintained."" Mercier also highlighted that Coty's ""fixed cost reduction program has allowed us to redirect capital to accelerate our brands and focus on profit delivery,"" with fixed costs dropping 15% year over year.

## 2. Aggressive product mix improvements

Rather than simply relying on its existing product mix to carry it forward, Coty is actively cutting support to brands failing to deliver adequate returns, while developing and supporting its profitable sectors. This process is strengthened by the fixed cost savings from improved efficiency noted above, with the company redirecting the money saved into investments in marketing. CEO Sue Nabi noted a ""virtuous circle of stepping up our media spending and reinvesting behind our newly repositioned brands.""

## 3. Other metrics look bullish

Driven in part by pandemic-related lockdowns of retail during 2020, Coty is continuing the development of its e-commerce segment. E-commerce sales jumped 30% in the fiscal third quarter, led by consumer beauty (56% year-over-year growth) but with good luxury sector sales improvements, too (20% growth). While Coty's e-commerce sales are still only 10% of the total, the company isn't ignoring this increasingly important channel, either.

While New World sales fell 6% during the quarter, Chinese sales soared by 27.7%, though they remain roughly a third of sales in the Americas, *Women's Wear Daily* reports. This again indicates Coty is successfully pushing through one of its turnaround goals, since increasing its presence in the massive China market is ""a key pillar in our strategy,"" according to Nabi.

## 4. The current CEO has a positive track record

Nabi has been Coty's CEO since mid-2020 and is an experienced beauty sector executive with past successes at turning around cosmetics and personal care brands from faltering to growing and profitable. Working at personal care company **L'Oreal SA** from 1993 through 2013, Nabi reconfigured its Lancome brand, focusing on the introduction of new luxury products to its line. These included a $350 facial cream, according to *Vogue*, and the high-profile La Vie Est Belle perfume.

According to Coty, Nabi's management raised Lancome's turnover to 3.2 billion euros during a three-year period, with positive sales growth every year, sometimes topping 10%. While no single individual is a guarantee of business success, Nabi's experience looks potentially well suited to developing the potential of Coty's other strengths.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

You will notice the price has moved 8% or so this week after Sue's presentation at Jeffries conference hit it out of the park, the slides below are from that presentation. I suspect upgrades will be coming in soon. Most recent is below from Evercore, representing a 60% plus upside in price. This is early early innings of the company's turn around aligning with the economy re-opening where the demand for cosmetics will never be higher. YoY comps are going to look incredible, especially with all the changes made during COVID. This could be a great hidden gem going into the second half of this year and into next year. Lets also not forget the demand for travel is going to be HUGE, we are already seeing it in TSA numbers. As more women travel and see family/friends, you better believe they will be purchasing makeup/perfume for those trips. As I said earlier, the play here is LEAPS, Europe was still mostly closed for this quarter which could impact the next ER. I've been buying all dips below $9 and believe we will easily retest recent $10.50 highs soon.

*Evercore just raised PT to $15.*

*Coty seen having 70% upside with Cover Girl recovery taking hold• Evercore ISI notes that sales of mass makeup skyrocketed in April as mask mandates were lifted, with Coty's (NYSE:COTY) Cover Girl posting its first market share gain in years.• Cover Girl is viewed as crucial for Coty. While the line only accounts for 10% of the company's sales, Evercore says it register multiples of that in terms of investment sentiment.• Evercore says Coty is seeing a turnaround after shelf space losses ended in Q2 last year. Cover Girl is said to be modestly regaining distribution, while increasing its productivity with retailers. In addition, new Cover Girl users come from Maybelline, e.l.f. and Revlon within Walmart and Target stores - suggesting to Evercore that competitive price points and displays, and innovation are working.• Evercore ISI keeps an Outperform rating on Coty and price target of $15 (70% upside). The 52-week high on Coty is $10.49.• The most recent bull on Coty to pop up on Seeking Alpha is Value Investor Research with its view that Coty appears materially undervalued even under conservative assumptions.*

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 16th, 2020.

# **Stocks are expected to see more wild swings, even if Fed makes big policy move  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/13/stocks-are-expected-to-see-more-wild-swings-even-if-fed-makes-big-policy-move.html)**
*****
> Now that stocks have entered a bear market, more wild volatility is expected in the week ahead as investors await a big policy move by the Federal Reserve.
*****
> The Federal Reserve meets Tuesday and Wednesday and is expected by some economists to take its benchmark federal funds target range back to zero, as the economy looks more and more like it could fall into a recession, due to the impact of the coronavirus.
*****
> In the past week, the market was sharply lower but swung wildly in both directions, including the stunning 10% decline in the Dow Thursday, the worst one-day drop since the 1987 market crash followed by Friday’s 9.3% gain, the best day in more than 11 years.
*****
> The S&P 500 ended up 9.3% Friday at 2,711, its best day since Oct. 28, 2008. The S&P is now 20.2% below its February high.
*****
> Strategists say the market purge is not over, though it could be closer to a bottom, with some expecting the S&P 500 to fall through 2,400 before it finds a floor.
*****
> “You could say we’re pricing a garden variety recession,” said Lori Calvasina, chief U.S. equities strategist at RBC. “We come up with a range of 2,300 to 2,600 as recession territory.” She said the average drop during a recession, since the 1930s, was 32%. The S&P had been as much as 29% off its Feb. 19 high.
*****
> “If [S&P] went below 2,300, it would be telling you the market is pricing in something worse than a recession, In the financial crisis we lost 57% and in the tech bubble, we lost 49%,” said Calvasina.
*****
> The S&P 500 was down 8.9% for the week, its worst loss since the week of Feb. 28.
*****
> “I think we needed to get through this week, in particular — the one where the country went into shut down and now get the second go around of policy response. If they really do bring out the bazookas we should be darn close” to the bottom, said Barry Knapp, Ironsides Macroeconomics director of research.
*****
> But strategists also point out that the coronavirus is unpredictable and it is hard to say when it will peak, even though many economists expect a bounce back in economic growth by the fourth quarter.
*****
> President Donald Trump declared a state of emergency Friday, which allows him to tap federal agencies to provide emergency funds and other responses to the crisis. The president also announced the government would buy oil to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserves and that 1.4 million test kits would be available in the next week.
*****
> Markets will also be looking for further action, which the Trump administration says could include targeted financial aid to industries that are hard hit, like airlines.
*****
> As communities around the country attempt to stop the spread of the virus, the potential hit to the economy grows. Companies have told workers to work from home, universities are shutting campuses, a handful of states closed public schools, and major sporting and other events have been canceled.
*****
> “If it indeed is declared a recession, it will really only be a three-month drop in activity,” said Knapp. “In 2008, the household sector had the highest debt levels it ever had, and the household sector was in no position to respond to stimulus. This is quite different.”
*****
> “We see where are are today is pricing in a recession. It went from a growth scare down to recession territory,” said Calvasina. She said the market is not ready to move higher yet. “I think something else we’ve got to see in addition to extreme panic ratings from the sentiment indicators, we do need to see the news flow get better on the virus.”
*****
> Investors will continue to look for more action from Washington, and in the coming week it will also be the Fed’s policy response that could drive the market.
*****
> “In light of the continued growth in coronavirus cases in the US and globally, the sharp further tightening in financial conditions, and rising risks to the economic outlook, we now expect the FOMC to cut the funds rate 100bp on March 18, a faster return to the crisis-era 0-0.25% rate than under our previous call for two 50bp steps in March and April,” Goldman economists wrote.

> The Fed on Thursday announced a significant increase in funds available for its repo operations, to provide liquidity for the short term funding markets. It also said it would purchase a broad range of Treasury securities, across maturities, with the $60 billion it currently uses to buy Treasury bills on a monthly basis.

> Economists say the Fed could announce other policy moves, like purchases of mortgage securities. Some expect it to return to a “patient” stance, showing a willingness to keep rates extremely low for a long time.

> Analysts have been watching the corporate bond market, where spreads blew out dramatically in the past week, particularly in high yield. Calvasina said she is not yet concerned.

> “We’ve got problems in energy. We have problems in some hospitality related industries. There are pockets of stress, but for me, when I look across most S&P companies’ balance sheets are in really good shape,” Calvasina said. “I don’t think this is a prolonged sort of downturn.”

# Signs Of A Washout?

> The S&P 500 Index’s historic slide continued yesterday, culminating in nearly a 10% loss for the day, and leaving the benchmark index officially in bear market territory, just 16 trading days after setting a record high on February 19. In addition, the S&P 500 has now moved more than 4% each day this week, leaving investors and professionals alike wondering when this volatility could end. While nobody knows for sure, one thing we always look for at market bottoms are signs of extremes, both from a sentiment and price perspective.

> From an anecdotal sentiment perspective, certainly fears of COVID-19 have reached the masses, with travel plans canceled and announcements of major events called off coming nearly every hour. However, investor survey data shows a similar story with the American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) Investor Sentiment Survey showing the highest percentage of bears since April 2013. In addition, the National Association of Active Investment Managers (NAAIM) Exposure Index, which represents the average exposure to US equity markets by the surveyed investment managers, reached its lowest level since September 2015. Following each of those instances, the S&P 500 rallied more than 13% over the next year.

> Another way of gauging sentiment can be from the internals of the market. While the S&P 500 is now well below its 200-day moving average, that doesn’t mean each stock in the index has moved below its respective 200-day moving average. In fact, regardless of the broad market’s trend, when less than 20% of the individual components of the index are trading below their 200-day moving averages, it is considered an extreme. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, Thursday’s sell-off left less 6% of the S&P 500 there, a number last seen in March 2009. “These are truly frightening times,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “However, it is important to remember that the signs of panic we are seeing are typically found at or near major market lows.”

# The Fastest Bear Market Ever

> The historic volatility continues, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average officially setting its fastest move from a new all-time high to a bear market (down 20% from the highs) in the 124-year history of the index. It took only 19 days for this to take place, which is far and away the new record.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Bear-market-1-1.png?ssl=1))**

> Not to be outdone, the S&P 500 Index is set to close down 20% from all-time highs today, doing this in only 16 days. Again, as of the time we are writing this blog, the S&P 500 is in bear market territory, but there always could be a chance for a late-day rally.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Bear-market-2.png?ssl=1))**

> “From major sports postponing their seasons, to travel bans to Europe, the economic impact of the coronavirus is growing exponentially with each passing day,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Markets are pricing in a potential recession and inevitable second quarter slowdown, but it is all about expectations. Should the virus be contained and the worst-case scenarios not materialize, now could be a nice opportunity for longer-term investors.”

> Last, one of Warren Buffett’s most famous quotes is, “Be fearful when others are greedy and be fearful when others are fearful.” We’ve seen many signs of extreme fear the past few days, but the CNN Fear & Greed Index hitting 1 earlier today is quite a historic level of fear. This proprietary indicator looks at multiple inputs (like put/call ratios, momentum, and volatility), but on a scale of 1-100, this morning’s 1 is the lowest level ever seen, besting the 2 it hit at the lows in December 2018. From a contrarian point of view, this could be quite meaningful.

# Perspectives on Waterfall Declines

> Volatile market action over the several weeks warrants some much needed perspective into the history of these types of waterfall declines. Fortunately, we have this research on hand and have been examining the nature of deep, fast selloffs like we have experience here in early 2020 as well as the nature of the inevitable and often sharp recoveries.

> First of all yes, this time is different – and yet it’s not. The headline causes of each of these historic waterfall declines are all different and yet investor, trader and money manager behavior remains rather similar. Fear has once again exposed the market’s overvaluation and weaknesses. This time it’s the fear of the coronavirus pandemic and price war in the oil market that spills over into the rest of the financial.

> Like the previous occurrences of waterfall declines in the table and graphs below the market reacted to fear and sold off fast and hard. It’s too early to tell if this waterfall decline is over or how fast and far the recovery will be. As we continue to analyze the current situation a thorough review of the history of waterfall declines and their subsequent recoveries should provide some much needed perspective.

# Friday 13th, DJIA Attempting to Recover & End Losing Friday Streak

> Friday is a significant day of the week because it is the last day of trading and positions held over the weekend could be at higher risk of an exogenous event or an unanticipated headline. Pages 143 & 144 of the Stock Trader’s Almanac 2020 show the difference in Friday performance during bull and bear markets. Friday’s have been weaker in bear markets.

> However today, on a Friday the 13th of all days, DJIA is fighting to recover some of its losses this week and to end its streak of down Fridays at seven. Down Friday DJIA losing streaks of seven or more, like the current streak, are actually somewhat rare in history. Prior to this year, DJIA has had just six similar or longer down Friday streaks going back to 1950. The last streak of down Fridays was in March and April of 2017. The longest streak lasted nine Fridays beginning on the last Friday of 2000 and lasting into February 2001.

 > In the above chart the 30 trading days before and the 60 trading days after the last six DJIA down Friday losing streaks of seven or more have been plotted to display the average performance before and after the last down Friday of the streak. (There are on average 21 trading days in a typical calendar month) Weakness and lower was the trend during the down Friday streak, but once the streak came to an end, DJIA was higher 60 trading days later.

# Last Stocks Above Their Moving Averages

> The massive declines over the past few weeks have left conditions extremely oversold. As we highlighted in yesterday's Sector Snapshot, breadth has been awful while there is no longer a single stock in the S&P 500 that is overbought (1 or more standard deviations above its 50-DMA). In fact, after yesterday's absolute washout, there is only a small handful of stocks that are above their 50 and 200-DMAs. In regards to the 50-DMA, less than 1% of stocks in the S&P 500 are above this average which is the first time that has happened since 2011. The only time in between that saw a similarly weak reading, although not quite hitting that under 1% requirement was back in December of 2018 when 1.19% of stocks were above their 50-DMA. As for the 200-DMA, only 5.59% are above that level. That is the lowest reading since March of 2009.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/MAs.png))**

> The average stock is now 26.56% below its 50-day and 24.5% below its 200-day. The table below shows those 22 remaining stocks that are still above their 200-DMAs as of yesterday's close and the few that are also below their 50-DMA. Of these, only Regeneron (REGN), Kroger (KR), Digital Realty Trust (DLR), and Gilead Sciences (GILD) are also above their 50-DMAs. The only other stock in the index that is also above its 50-DMA is Cabot Oil and Gas (COG), though it is 11% below its 200-DMA. While these stocks have all held above their long term moving average recently, only GILD and REGN have risen since the index's high on 2/19.

# Selloff Erases All of US Market Cap Gains Since Election Day 2016

> With the US stock market down nearly 7% yet again today, the total market cap of US companies as measured by the Russell 3,000 has fallen $11.5 trillion in less than a month. On February 19th, total US market cap was just over $35 trillion. It's at $23.8 trillion as of this morning.

> What makes this drop even more noteworthy is that $23.8 trillion was the market cap of US companies on Election Day 2016. At this point in time, all of the market cap gains seen since President Trump's election victory have been wiped out.

# Low Rates Send Mortgage Applications Surging

> Coronavirus fears have broadly sent rates lower over the past month. Currently, the national average for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage stands at 3.68%; just off the low of 3.55% from earlier in the month. With mortgage rates now basically at their lowest levels since late 2016, homeowners have been quickly enticed to jump on these lower rates.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/MRNA.png))**

> Last week, weekly mortgage applications from the Mortgage Bankers Association showed a roughly 15% surge as rates were reaching record lows. In the time since then, the Fed's 50 bps cut came into effect and yields fell even further which led mortgage applications this week to surge 55.4%. That is the highest week over week increase in mortgage applications since November of 2008 when they had risen 112.1%. Outside of that period, we've only seen larger weekly increases a few other times since 1990.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/MA-1.png))**

> The spike was driven largely by refinancing applications which rose 78.6% week-over-week. As with the composite, that was the biggest weekly jump in refi applications since the housing bubble. Prior to that, once again you would need to go back to 2001 or the 1990s to find larger weekly increases in mortgage refinance applications.

FedEx CEO says he expects the economy to enter a ‘worldwide recession’,23,xfpxu9,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xfpxu9/fedex_ceo_says_he_expects_the_economy_to_enter_a/,16,2022-09-16 17:56:37,"FedEx CEO Raj Subramaniam told CNBC’s Jim Cramer on Thursday that he believes a recession is impending for the global economy.

“I think so. But you know, these numbers, they don’t portend very well,” Subramaniam said in response to Cramer’s question of whether the economy is “going into a worldwide recession.”

The CEO’s pessimism came after FedEx missed estimates on revenue and earnings in its first quarter. The company also withdrew its full year guidance.

Shares of FedEx fell 15% in extended trading on Thursday.

“I’m very disappointed in the results that we just announced here, and you know, the headline really is the macro situation that we’re facing,” Subramaniam said in an interview on “Mad Money.”

The chief executive, who assumed the position earlier this year, said that weakening global shipment volumes drove FedEx’s disappointing results. While the company anticipated demand to increase after factories shuttered in China due to Covid opened back up, it actually fell, he said.

FedEx (FDX) CEO Raj Subramaniam said he expects the economy to enter a global recession. He also said “We are a reflection of everybody else’s business"" FDX recently reported missed earnings and withdrew its 2023 guidance. Do you agree with Subramaniam?"

#Trading Update

  * What’s happening this morning? It was another quiet night of news. Stocks in Asia were
mixed (Japan, Taiwan, and Australia saw pressure while mainland China and HK did well) but
Eurozone equities are trading lower across the board (and US futures are down small).
There were no major headlines in the last 12-18 hours, neither on the macro nor micro
fronts. Treasury yields rose Mon but are reversing that entire move so far Tues. Crude
spiked Mon morning on the Qatar news before bleeding lower throughout the day amid
worries the rift could imperil the OPEC/Russia production deal (oil is flat-to-down small so
far Tues morning; there are some indications that countries like Kuwait are working to
mediate the Qatar diplomatic crisis). Europe is being led lower by basic resources,
chemicals, retail, and healthcare (Roche is a big laggard in the last category on back of
downbeat data; in general ASCO hasn’t been kind to large caps w/BMY getting hit Mon due
to news out of the conf.). The week’s big events are coming up on Thurs (ECB, Comey, UK
election).
  * Calendar for Tues June 6 – the focus will be on Emperor Coffeve’s meeting w/Congressional GOP
leaders (the focus is on jumpstarting Emperor Coffeve’s legislative agenda), the US JOLTs report for
Apr (10amET), some analyst meetings (M, MDP, and PRU), earnings (CONN, CSIQ, FRAN,
FRED, HDS, LE, MIK, and SCWX pre-open and AMBA, HQY, KEYS, OXM, PLAY, SEAC, and
UNFI after the close), and a slew of conferences.
  * Europe – the major indices are trading down ~30bp. Autos, basic resources, chemicals,
media, retail, and healthcare are leading on the downside while staples, real estate, energy,
and utilities are outperforming. Lufthansa is rallying following pos. remarks from the
company while Roche is getting hit on underwhelming data. The EUR isn’t doing a whole
lot.
  * Asia – the major indices in Asia saw mixed price action overnight: Japan (TPX -0.84%, NKY -
0.95%), HK (Hang Seng +0.52%, HSCEI +0.09%), mainland China (SHCOMP +0.34%, Shenzhen
+0.55%, CSI 300 +0.7%), Taiwan (TAIEX -0.2%), Australia (ASX 200 -1.52%), and India (down
~35-40bp). South Korea was closed. There weren’t too many major headlines out of the
region. In Japan all the major sub-groups saw pressure; healthcare, telecoms, utilities, and
industrials fell the most. Toshiba rallied after media reports pointed (again) to a potential
AVGO bid for the memory unit. HK/China outperformed the rest of Asia; within the Hang
Seng top groups included real estate, tech, and industrials while discretionary, energy, and
staples lagged.

#Top Headlines for Tuesday

  * Economic data/monetary policy headlines for Tues 6/6. It was generally a slow morning.
Eurozone retail sales came in a touch light for Apr at +0.1% M/M vs. the St +0.2%. The RBA
left rates unchanged, as expected (http://bit.ly/2r0MBZS). JPMorgan is trimming Q1
Australian GDP estimates following weak net trade and gov’t spending data
(http://bit.ly/2qSDYkS). Japanese Apr wage inflation data points to some firming
(http://bit.ly/2rZw7pX).
  * Washington update – all the media wants to talk about is Russia/Comey, all Emperor Coffeve wants to
talk about (for this week) is infrastructure, and the market couldn’t care less about either
issue. Political expectations have been subdued for weeks and this is helping insulate stocks
from all the Washington-linked noise. Curiosity and a relatively barren calendar will have
eyes glued to Comey on Thurs but this isn’t likely to be a market-moving event. Meanwhile
all the infrastructure-related noise is considered by most to be just that (empty rhetoric w/o
a chance of passing into law) and actually could be counterproductive (to the extent it
places yet another burden on Congress at a time when its agenda is already very full). From
the perspective of the SPX the focus right now is on the debt ceiling, the F18 budget, and
Emperor Coffeve’s Fed nominees. Investors are reasonable confident in Washington avoiding a debt
 ceiling debacle and shutdown (although the latter issue may require a few CRs before a final
agreement is reached). Taxes are still important but at this point simply getting the
corporate rate and repatriation rate to <28% and 8-10%, respectively, by the end of CQ1:18
would be considered a victory.
   * Emperor Coffeve to meet w/Congressional GOP leaders on Tues 6/6 in a bid to jumpstart his
agenda; White House wants healthcare vote this summer, tax reform in fall –
Reuters http://reut.rs/2rwmoWP
   * Republicans increasingly concerned that Emperor Coffeve’s behavior (and tweeting) is
increasingly placing their agenda in peril – Washington Post.
http://wapo.st/2rORPfF
   * Taxes - House Republican leaders’ controversial border adjustment tax is dead, and
as a result, their plans to dramatically overhaul the tax code could soon be too – Roll
Call http://bit.ly/2rwgsgr
   * Healthcare – Senate Republicans are pushing forward on healthcare w/the
leadership keen to have a vote by the Jul 4 recess even if the measure doesn’t have
enough support to pass. Senate Republicans will meet Tues to discuss the issue.
McConnell doesn’t want healthcare dominating the rest of the year and thinks a
vote soon will help provide clarity (either enough support exists or it doesn’t and
the GOP moves on to other items). At this point it doesn’t look like 50 votes exist.
Politico. http://politi.co/2rYgQ90
   * Emperor Coffeve turns on his AG – Emperor Coffeve is said to be souring on AG Sessions, upset over the
stalled travel ban and particularly incensed about Sessions having recused himself
from the various Russia probes. Emperor Coffeve doesn’t think a special counsel would have
been appointed if Sessions hadn’t recused himself. NYT. http://nyti.ms/2sMkb7m
   * Emperor Coffeve to launch new America-themed hotel chain – the Emperor Coffeve Organization will
launch a new lower-end hotel chain dubbed “American Idea” that it hopes will
appeal to budget-conscious patriots; the first locations will open in little-known
towns in Mississippi (a state that went for Emperor Coffeve by 18 points over Clinton) and
should come online quickly as the initiative will involve rebranding existing Holiday
Inns and Comfort Inns – NYT http://nyti.ms/2ruCUGG
  * Economic conditions aren’t very different from 2016 (when the Fed kept policy on hold for
most of the year) but financial conditions are much healthier today and that is giving the
FOMC comfort to proceed w/additional hiking – FT http://on.ft.com/2rN84cR
  * US and Mexico close to a sugar deal – Wilbur Ross said the two countries are nearing an
agreement around sugar; the Mon deadline has been pushed back 24 hours to allow for
additional negotiations. WSJ. http://on.wsj.com/2sx7Ep9
  * Oil output set to rise in 2018 regardless of the OPEC/Russia agreement (and there are
some compliance concerns w/regards to that pact). Marketwatch has a cautious oil article
noting that output looks set to rise despite the recent Russia/OPEC agreement. Meanwhile
there are signs that compliance w/the pact could be weakening at the margin.
http://on.mktw.net/2rXMXFU
  * Qatar – Kuwait is mediating the recent rift between Qatar and some of its Middle Eastern
neighbors; Qatar hopes Kuwait will be able to reduce some of the friction – Reuters
http://reut.rs/2rZ4PA0
  * Qatar – the $1B ransom payment to al Qaeda affiliates and Iran was “the straw that broke
the camel’s back” – a group of Qatari royals were kidnapped in Iraq while on a hunting trip
and the gov’t paid $1B in ransom to get them back. That payment, to groups affiliated
w/terrorist organizations and the Iran, caused Qatar’s Gulf neighbors (and Egypt) to sever
diplomatic ties. FT http://on.ft.com/2qUXTnA
  * China/climate change – China is looking to capitalize on its lead in solar and wind energy as
the Emperor Coffeve administration ostensibly deemphasizes renewables; Beijing wants to help other
countries meet their climate goals – NYT http://nyti.ms/2sN3PLH
  * Active managers are beginning to beat the market (although not in a particularly
encouraging fashion) – the WSJ notes that active performance has improved of late
although this seems to simply be a function of managers overweighting a handful of
momentum stocks. WSJ http://on.wsj.com/2sxfSNT
   

#Company-specific news update for Mon night. 

 
 * In general it was a slow night of headlines although a few items were in focus. J. Crew announced a mgmt. transition that will see Mickey Drexler give up his CEO role to West Elm’s James Brett (Drexler will remain
chairman); http://on.wsj.com/2rMrK0z. PRGO also said its CEO will be stepping down (the
co has created a search committee to find a successor). MCHP raised its June Q guidance;
the co now sees revs at the mid-point of the range rising 5.25% Q/Q (vs. the prior mid-point
+4.5%) and EPS will come in 1.22-1.26 (vs. the prior 1.17-1.27); http://bit.ly/2rMXRgO. CASY
shares slumped in after-hours trading after earnings came in light of expectations while THO
rallied on back of better results. RAD put out an update on the WBA deal, stating that the
FTC’s longer than expected review of the merger has left a negative impact on the
company’s results. SIG shares fell after the close after announcing the departure of its COO
for violations of company policy “unrelated to financial matters”. CSX’s CEO reassured
shareholders during the co’s shareholder meeting on Mon that he would be able to lead the
turnaround despite requiring supplemental oxygen for an undisclosed medical condition
(http://on.wsj.com/2sKPjUR). Sony made pos. comments on PS4 sales and says robust
Nintendo Switch trends aren’t subtracting from PlayStation’s momentum
(http://on.ft.com/2qURKYt). According to Bloomberg, Sprint/S and TMUS are considering
an all-stock option as they proceed w/merger talks (https://bloom.bg/2r0RwtR). WDC is
offering concessions to Toshiba in a bid to strike a semi deal and avoid the unit being sold to
a 3rd party (http://s.nikkei.com/2qUQrZz). SFR will purchase a portfolio of single family
rental homes for $815M funded by a subsequently announced equity offering.
 
 * Toshiba/AVGO – Toshiba shares rallied Tues after the Asahi newspaper reported
that it is considering giving AVGO exclusive rights to negotiate a purchase of the
memory unit. Reuters http://reut.rs/2qWyMRp
 * AMZN targets core WMT customer segment – AMZN is launching a new Prime
membership price aimed at lower-income Americans receiving government
assistance (the new rate is $5.99/month). WMT captured ~18% of all money spent
through the SNAP program last year (about ~$13B in revs) and AMZN is attacking
that market. WSJ. http://on.wsj.com/2rGgNf0
 * AAPL recap – the WWDC was largely as expected and didn’t contain any surprises
(AAPL shares opened in the red on back of a d/g Mon morning and stayed at those
levels throughout the entire session – there wasn’t any major movement around
the Tim Cook keynote which started at 1pmET). The HomePod was marketed more
as a music device (i.e. a Sonos competitor) instead of a broader home assistant (it
will do all the home assisting tasks via Siri but the device contains high-end audio
specifications absent from AMZN Echo and others); the one criticism that most had
w/the product was its price ($349). The whole MacBook lineup received a refresh
(as expected). The main purpose of the WWDC are Apple’s various operation
systems and they were a central piece of the Mon keynote (some of the highlights:
Apple introduced a Venmo money transfer competitor for iOS along w/a GDOTbacked
debit card and announced that Amazon TV will be coming to tvOS).


#Calendar of events to watch for the week of Mon June 5
 
  * Calendar for Wed June 7 – the focus will be on China’s FX reserve numbers for May (Tues
night/Wed morning), German factory orders for Apr (2amET), the India RBI decision
(5amET), US consumer credit for Apr (3pmET), analyst meetings (RJF, TAP, and WCC),
earnings (BF’b pre-open and TLRD, VRNT after the close), and a slew of conferences.
  * Calendar for Thurs June 8 – the focus will be on China’s May imports/exports (Wed
night/Thurs morning), German industrial production for Apr (2amET), the UK election, the
ECB decision (7:45amET statement and 8:30amET press conf.), Comey’s testimony before
the Senate Intelligence panel, analyst meetings (AZPN and SYMC), earnings (Dell, SJM preopen
and CLDR, Hudson’s Bay, and PAY after the close), and conference presentations.
   * ECB decision – the language around growth will likely turn more sanguine and the
balance of risks could approach “balanced”. However, Draghi will likely strongly
qualify any growth optimism with ongoing inflation caution (recall the most recent
Eurozone CPI for May, out 5/31, fell short of expectations). The promise to enhance
monetary accommodation even further may be dropped although the text isn’t
likely to threaten earlier tightening. The language around asset purchases, rates,
and policy sequencing will probably stay unchanged (the market would welcome a
return of the deposit rate to 0% given the headwind this represents for banks
although the ECB will likely be averse to take this step as it could be misconstrued as
premature tightening by the market).
   * UK election - May/Tory Party poll numbers have softened over the last few weeks
and the latest readings suggest the conservatives will fall short of an outright
parliamentary majority (~305-310 for the Tories, ~260 for labor, and ~80 for other
parties).
  * Calendar for Fri June 9 – the focus will be on China’s May CPI/PPI (Thurs night/Fri morning),
German imports/exports for Apr (2amET), and the US wholesale inventories/trade
numbers for Apr (10amET).
Catalysts for 2017 – big events to watch for 2017 (preliminary list – additional events likely to be
added)

reducing monetary stimulus” at this meeting.
  * UK elections – June 8.
  * Comey testimony – June 8 in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee
  * US financial regulatory review – the Treasury will present recommendations to Emperor Coffeve in
June on ways to ease financial regulations (a recent Reuters article said the Treasury review
won’t be fully completed on time and instead recommendations will be issued in stages
http://reut.rs/2pqhkPo).
  * French parliamentary elections – June 11 and 18
  * Fed meeting – decision out Wed 6/14 (Yellen press conf./dot plot update)
  * Eurozone fin min meeting – June 15 (agreement on Greece possible).

  * ECB meeting/press conf. Jul 20
  * Fed meeting – decision out Wed 7/26
  * Congress breaks for summer recess – Fri Jul 28. Congress returns Sept 5.
  * Fed/Jackson Hole – Aug 2017 (prior start dates: 8/25/16, 8/27/15, 8/21/14, 8/22/13).
  * Emperor Coffeve tax blueprint – the WH plans to give Congress details on its tax blueprint when the
House/Senate return from the Aug recess (they return 9/5).
  * German elections – German federal election Sept 24.
  * AAPL – the co will likely hold an iPhone 8 launch event in Sept
  * US debt ceiling – the debt ceiling will need to be raised probably by the fall at the latest
(Mnuchin and Mulvaney recently said they would like to see Congress take action before
leaving for the Aug recess).
  * US gov’t funding – spending authorization expires on Sept 30.
  * Italy – the country could hold elections in the fall of 2017 (JPMorgan thinks the odds of

mentioned in the press for 2017 Italian elections are Sept 24 (same date as the German
election) and Oct 22.

  * Infrastructure spending was supposed to be a “unicorn”, the one issue capable of
transcending party lines and mustering enough support to get to Emperor Coffeve’s desk. However,
lately infrastructure is looking like just another horse w/both sides far apart on specifics.

Lets talk about Friday,38,keghq5,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/keghq5/lets_talk_about_friday/,36,2020-12-17 01:23:53,"Fellow autists,

This Friday is a quad-witching , index rebalancing and TSLA’s final day before SP500 inclusion. Let’s discuss these possible plays. Pick strikes based on your preferred gambling investment strategy. This a discussion starter, not DD.

**SPY put exp 12/18, buy 12/17**

Every stock in the SP500 index is facing sell pressure as funds make $80billion worth of room on Friday for $TSLA. Indexes will use 12/18 closing price to add the stock for 12/21.

Not-so-obvious complications:

• 12/18 will be very high volume anyway, will the sell pressure get drowned out?

• Selling could take place AH/Dark pool. Will we see it intraday?

• Stimulus announcement off the top rope

• Bears are gay

**TSLA calls 12/24, buy 12/17**

$80billion worth of shares need to be bought by market open 12/21.

Not-so-obvious complications:

• Is a full $80billion still needing purchased or have steady purchases already been made over the past month (when the stock was cheaper)?

• Run-up to inclusion is unpredictable plus TSLA already gained 50%+ since announcement

• IV is well over 100%

• Indexes are using end of day 12/18 price to buy TSLA. Big purchase would happen between close 12/18 and open 12/21.

• Careful holding longer than 12/21, see next play

**TSLA puts 12/24 or later, buy 12/21 (end-of-day to be safe)**

Stocks predominantly lose 15-20% after S&P inclusion starting immediately after. This is a well-studied phenomenon with a large sample size to back it up. Could be a sell-the-news event starting regardless. Can’t go tits up!

Not-so-obvious complications:

• TSLA is a unicorn with rare circumstances like never being in the S&P 100 before inclusion and coming in as the 6th heaviest weight in the index

• Shorting TSLA is terrifying

• TSLA short shorts on backorder due to high demand

**BONUS PLAY: UPS straddle 12/18, buy 12/17**

Fedex earnings 12/17. Expectations are excellent numbers, excellent outlook. Vaccine distro included in outlook. Play the earnings without the IV crush using its peer UPS. UPS IV is 30%. Pick a direction and tempt the earnings demon or buy a straddle and profit on any decent movement either way (3% minimum). Look at previous earnings by FDX or UPS for examples. Synergizes well with Play #1 - SPY put 12/18

Not-so-obvious complications:

• Low movement could hurt, wrong side of the straddle gunna take a big L regardless

• This sounds smart enough to somehow not work

**POSITIONS: Still riding $TSLA 460c 1/15/21**

tl;dr - Read the bold letters"
Amazon and UPS Earnings play,35,iunl1u,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/iunl1u/amazon_and_ups_earnings_play/,38,2020-09-17 22:31:46,"Before starting this off, I believe RH has the wrong earnings date for Amazon, it will be 10/29, a Thursday and not 10/23, be aware before jumping in. The past three earnings of this year have all been on the 30th of the month, think the trend will hold true.

**Amazon**

\-In the near future we will have Prime Day, it was delayed from July and is soon to be announced to be in [October](https://www.techradar.com/amazon-prime-day/prime-day-2020), I expect this to happen by the end of September

\-Next up we have Black Friday and Cyber Monday, with Black Friday (in person shopping) being canceled throughout the country due to the Corona Virus, we are going to see an unprecedented number of people shopping online this year for deals, Amazon will benefit from this greatly

\-Holiday season, self explanatory, Amazon will be shipping and delivering goods at levels not seen before. Keep in mind as well, as the weather gets colder, predicted more spikes in Corona, more than likely people will be shopping from home again.

\-Reported back in April of 2020 Amazon had hired [100,000](https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-hiring-75000-more-workers-during-coronavirus-outbreak-2020-4) new employees already this year and planned on another 75,000. Now, three days ago, they announced they are hiring [another](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/14/amazon-to-hire-100000-more-workers-in-its-latest-job-spree-this-year.html) 100,000 to keep pace with the pandemic demand and holiday peak season

\-AWS, with WFH being a huge factor now, more people have turned their businesses to AWS, an example of this would be [zoom](https://www.forbes.com/sites/soorajshah/2020/06/17/zoom-will-mostly-run-on-amazon-cloud-for-foreseeable-future-says-aws-ceo-andy-jassy/#69beec944e2b), one of the fastest growing tech stocks this year

\-Memberships for Prime had reached over 150 million subscribers in Jan 2020 at $120 USD per year, with more people joining prime in the fourth quarter of 2019 than any quarter previously. I can only assume that that has held steady and more than likely increased during this pandemic as more people are shopping from home and/or want to have another streaming service because they are bored in their house.

\-Analysts have an average price for the stock at $3725

[This](https://www.statista.com/chart/15917/amazon-revenue-by-segment/) is the breakdown of revenue for Amazon back in 2018/2019 for reference.

I for sure missed some things for Amazon and I know I am brief on the AWS segment as that is their fastest growing segment for business, please feel free to add more in the comments. Amazon is on sale right now, lowest it has been since July 1st.

**10/30 3500c**

**UPS (earnings late October)**

I work in the transportation and manufacturing industry, see my DD on [Fedex](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ipqh6q/more_fdx_dd/)

\- UPS announced that they will be hiring 100,000 workers for this peak season this year with a large number of those roles being turned into permanent roles

\- Like Fedex, UPS has also hiked up their [rates](https://www.ups.com/us/en/shipping/rates-update.page) and added surcharges onto their package delivery

\- If a package is delivered late, UPS has a policy that they give a full refund, but during corona that policy is not in effect

\- UPS delivers 30-40% of all packages for amazon, and you have to think that during peak season that will increase as the workload is going to be that much more and UPS has more of a workforce to handle the surplus

\- UPS holiday rate increase anyone? I just called my local UPS store to figure this out rather than waiting for a response, UPS has not released their rate/surcharge for the christmas season yet, but they told me there would be one. If someone that works at UPS corporate reads this, get that shit on your website you mongoloids, you are behind fedex.

\-Fedex beat their earnings, an expected EPS of 2.69 and a beat of 4.87, as of now, UPS is below where they were when Fedex beat, now would be a prime time to get in

**Edit**

Adding to the fire, [this](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2020/09/17/usps-trump-coronavirus-amazon-foia/) came out today.

""But the documents unearthed by American Oversight suggest Amazon is a  lucrative client for the mail service. Amazon drove about $3.9 billion  in revenue, and $1.6 billion in profit, for the USPS in fiscal 2019,  according to multiple emails and financial statements obtained via open  records laws. The Postal Service delivered 1.54 billion packages on  Amazon’s behalf last year, about 30 percent of the company’s total  volume in 2019, and deliveries and revenue increased this year, the  documents also indicate. ""

Since Dejoy royally fucked the USPS and USPS and amazon had to part ways, UPS and Amazon themselves will be delivering these packages going forward.

Edit 2, [eBay](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/09/19/usps-ebay-mail-delays/)  just announced that they will be shifting their shipping from USPS to UPS"
