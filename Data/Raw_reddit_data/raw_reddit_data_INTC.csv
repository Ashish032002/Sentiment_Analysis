I bought $700k worth of Intel stock today ,29027,1ehjuzj,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ehjuzj/i_bought_700k_worth_of_intel_stock_today/,11818,2024-08-01 21:12:44,"https://preview.redd.it/83gh52szi2gd1.png?width=1634&format=png&auto=webp&s=fba99bb67e4b11aa973fe830f535c775083bbc05

TLDR: Grandma died 2 months ago. Left me $800k inheritance. I'm only a junior in college as a math major and I don't really have any use for the money, nor do I have any debt (I'm very fortunate that my parents are paying for my education). I always heard about people losing their inheritance by spending it on garbage instead of investing. So I told my parents I'm not going to spend a cent of this money and I'm going to invest all of it and they were proud of me. I put 100k into a high yield savings account and bought 700k worth of Intel stock at market open. I plan on holding this for a decade depending on how it performs. 

Here's why I like Intel: 

- 2024 Q1 up 9% YOY 

- Intel has been heavily investing and restructuring by building out the domestic foundry business to manufacture semiconductor chips for third party companies. 

- With Intel 3 in production, leading-edge semiconductors are being manufactured in the US for the first time in a decade. Intel will regain process leadership as the Intel Foundry continues to grow. 

- I think the fact that Intel is positioning itself to be the largest semiconductor manufacturer in the US is massive. The US Gov is heavily prioritizing domestic semiconductor production and thus is heavily supporting Intel as a company with R&D funding. 

- If NVIDIA or AMD are ever forced to change manufacturers due to rising tensions/war between China & Taiwan, Intel will likely be a sole or largest manufacturer for NVIDIA and AMD 

- Intel has been heavily investing in R&D. 5.9B out of 12.7B of Q124 revenue was invested in R&D. 

- Intel is on track to exceed its forecast of 40 million AI PCs shipped by the end of 2024

- The Intel Gaudi 3AI accelerator is projected to deliver 50% faster inference and 40% greater inference power efficiency than NVIDIA H100 on leading AI models. 

- Trading at Forward PE of 17.05 

- Geopolitical tensions will ultimately work in Intel's favor more than any other company in this industry 

- I like the stock and I think its really cheap rn :)

Talking about $INTC Takeover Rumors and Apollo Deal,85,1fnco7n,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1fnco7n/talking_about_intc_takeover_rumors_and_apollo_deal/,92,2024-09-23 10:21:55,"Let‚Äôs talk about the rumors: Qualcomm potentially taking over Intel, and the investment from Apollo. First, the Qualcomm takeover‚Äîit‚Äôs super unlikely. A takeover is usually either a cash buyout or a merger.

No way Qualcomm goes for a cash buyout. They don‚Äôt have that kind of cash lying around, and there‚Äôs no chance they‚Äôre gonna take on massive debt just to buy Intel. Intel isn‚Äôt exactly rolling in profits right now, so taking on that debt would just hurt Qualcomm in the long run with all the interest payments and losses they'd have to deal with from Intel. So yeah, not happening.

A merger seems a bit more possible, but here‚Äôs the thing: Qualcomm is already crushing it in AI chips for phones and probably gonna lead the AI PC game too. What do they really get from merging with Intel? The foundry business is the only thing that might attract them, but the price could be steep. Qualcomm would have to deal with Intel‚Äôs losses and those from its subsidiaries. Plus, Intel‚Äôs board and shareholders wouldn‚Äôt agree to a lowball offer. And if Qualcomm offers a premium just for the foundry, I‚Äôm not sure their board or shareholders would sign off either.

So yeah, a merger? Not likely. Best case, Qualcomm ends up being a big customer for Intel‚Äôs foundry business when they spin it off.

As for the Apollo deal, that seems more legit, but $5 billion isn‚Äôt gonna move the needle much for Intel. It might cover one or two quarters of cash burn, but the downside is a likely unsexy valuation and heavy dilution for shareholders. Intel needs the money, so it‚Äôll probably happen, but it‚Äôs definitely not great news for shareholders‚Äîdefinitely not the bullish one.

My plan going into this was to hold for a decade and my plan hasn't changed. It's going to be rough and I realize that. The past two days have been the scariest days of my life. My parents still don't know I've lost 1/3 of my inheritance. Every time I talk to them they can see how stressed I look and they keep asking me what's wrong and I don't know what to say. How can I possibly explain this to them? My only option is to hold for a decade. So that's what I'm going to do. I know people are going to shit on me, and you should. I recognize I made an unnecessarily regarded decision. I have received a lot of DMs and reddit notifications offering me mental help and Suicide hotline numbers. I appreciate your concern but I'm fine. I'm holding long term. I'm sorry if my decision made you upset and reflect on your financial situation, that was not my intention.

Every other comparable tech stock is up 5000%-20000% since then.

People are too focused on Intel consumer and data center products, which by the way are improving at impressive rate. Now they have AI chip comparable to NVIDIA's H100 (Guadi 3). Lunar lake SoC for laptops based on 3nm, upcoming desktop CPUs based on Intel 20 (Arrow Lake in Q3), and they also announced the next gen of Intel Arc GPUs with massive gains and driver improvements to make them very competitive with AMD & NVIDIA offerings.

**But the real deal is Intel Foundry segment.**

Currently Intel is the only company in the world that has ASML's next gen EUV machines (called High-NA) up and running. They will be able to manufacture sub 2nm silicon at impressive rate. No other company has received such machines. With rumors that TSMC (current leader in foundry business) will only receive them in 2026, and **I doubt the USA will allow much to be sent to Taiwan, for obvious security reasons.**

Microsoft & Qualcomm already announced they gonna use Intel upcoming 18A node for their future products, and it's only matter of time until we hear others like NVIDIA & Apple jumping in.

If you are a big tech company and want the best, cutting edge silicon you will have to switch to Intel foundry sooner or later.

When the foundry(s) build out is complete , capx will slow down, and eps will increase considerably.

The short report for Intel (INTC) - A rabbit hole of CPU failures rate since 2022.,83,1ebr68q,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ebr68q/the_short_report_for_intel_intc_a_rabbit_hole_of/,106,2024-07-25 15:36:28,"Forenote: Im a technical person, A developer, this will be a technical DD to show how intel is failing to do their basic business model of manufacturing CPUs.

Over the past month or so Intels customers have been becoming increasing irrate about CPUs just flat out dying after various finger pointing from Intel being debunked.

I first caught wind of intels failures when a friends system started to become unstable, he would crash in games and sometimes doing mundane tasks. It all came to a clicking point when his systems files started becoming corrupted and he needed to attempt reinstalling windows. The attempts failed, windows couldnt even install without corrupted files, sometimes it would install and look fine, but running a verification shows that various system files were still corrupted but not important enough for the system to boot successfully. He would still get various crashes doing mundane things and gaming. It was basically a working brick at this point.

So i got my research hat on, and discovered various reddit users on r/pcmasterrace  were also reporting instability with their PCs. Not alot tho, this has been the wierd thing, Intel has such a large CPU failure rate, but not alot of reports which caught everyone by suprise. It started to make sense, the causes of the crashes were different for everything. Users were reporting issues with Nvidia, Issues with RAM, and issues with corrupted data. Obviously to any layman, these issues dont instantly point to an issue with the CPU. With GPU errors, Nvidia initially got heat, but Nvidia quickly debunked the issue reporting the GPUs that were returned were fully functional and had no issues.

So I pulled out my handy dandy debug tools since my friend managed to get windows installed and it kinda runs. The first tests I ran were memory block verification. This validates that the memory is able to hold data immutably, after 4 hours the tests finished all green, the memory was stable and wasnt corrupting data. (its worth noting that the memory test software I used was very CPU lite so the CPU has little chance to corrupt the data its self, this is a stark difference to the Drive tests I ran.).

Since my friend was getting corrupted files almost everytime he install anything, I ran the disk debug tools, these pull the S.M.A.R.T data from the drive and run various read and write tests. The S.M.A.R.T data came back green, the drive was reporting it had no errors or irregularies and was functioning fine, So i moved to the read and write tests, all red, the drive had a 90% file currption rate, I pulled the S.M.A.R.T data again, All green, the drive was still reporting it was functioning correctly.

At this point, anyone would deduce they had a bad drive that was misbehaving, leading to the decreased number of CPU failure reports. After all, How can you say the CPU is bad when you have corrupt files? Many people forget how much the CPU is responsable for. When you read files or write files, its the CPU that tells the Drive what to store and where and what to read and where it is on the disk to read it from. and as i said, the software I used to test the drives is CPU intensive, it uses the the CPU to generate random data to store on the drive and hashes that data to verify it. So a bad CPU = Currupted data on the drive.

Luckly my friend has 4 drives, So I told him to take out the ""bad"" drive and put in another one, I ran all my tests again and same result, the drive was reporting it was functional, but all the data was corrupted. The result was the same with all the drives tested. Now, this is a luxary many people dont have. Many people would get corrupted data on their drive and think the drive is dying and get a new one. However with 4 tests samples all failing the same way when days ago they were all fine is a very low chance.

Now for the kicker, Intel has a tool to verify that the Intel CPU you have is a genuine Intel CPU, I guess intel has a problem of china making fake intel CPUs??? Ive never seen any but what the hell, its a useful tools since its does some basic CPU level checks. So i ran the verifier tool and its first test for a genuine CPU comes back green, Cool, it is a real Intel CPU. Memory test comes back green (We alreadt tested this soo good), next was the Graphics tests. Failed, the CPU was attempting to send data to the GPU and it corrupted the GPU memory.

So now we have 2 symptoms.

* Disk data corruption
* GPU memory corruption

My friend has Nvidia GPU and Nvidia previously debunked any issues with their GPUs. But we have a common cause, Intel CPUs are corrupting data when sending it to another device in the system (except RAM), Data sent to a disk gets corrupted and data sent to the GPU gets corrupted, which would explain the game crashes. Various other tests passed from boost speed changing, Wifi tests and math operations.

After I finished all the tests and determed the issue is with the CPU, my friend RMA'd the CPU. This is where more troubles start. Intel refused the RMA, citing user damage, According to intel all the issues my friend was having was his fault and he caused the damage, After it was refused, I filed the RMA for him, to the same response, but because im a stickler I pushed for more info, Intel was refusing the RMA because of overclocking done by the motherboard. This is a previous blame game intel played, they were blaming Motherboards for putting in stock overclocks on CPUs causing them to fail, but this wasnt the case with my friend, his motherboard wasnt even stock overclocked, but intel refused it anyway.

After this point is when the waterfall started coming down, a advanced tech-youtuber posted an expos√© about intels CPU failures. See: [Intel has a HUGE problem - Level1Tech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzHcrbT5D_Y) the curtains were starting to fall, Apparently Game developers and datacenters (Intels BIGGEST customers) were getting large amounts of CPU failures specificly with intel CPUs. Now datacenters are normally quiet about this type of thing, opting to sort their issues directly with intel, but intel is turning away datacenters RMA's of thousands of CPUs, these datacenters has since publicly reported they are dropping intel systems from their products and only supporting AMD systems from now on. Intel has lost their largest customer base, because of their defective products and refusing to take responsability for the product inherit flaw.

Intel is hoping this goes unnoticed, since reports are still low of CPUs failing because the errors are random and different each time and users dont know their CPU is defective, there isnt a big in your face ""The Intel CPU in this system has errored"" its always an error with something else, which is caused by the CPU. So intel is betting on customers blaming other manufactures like they did with Nvidia when this all started.

* **\[Dec 2022\]** The first instances of ""Out of Video Memory"" issues on 13th Gen Core i9 CPUs were reported back in 2022. (Source: [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/zgl1y2/out_of_video_memory_error_on_high_end_system/)). This is a few months after the release of Intel's 13th Gen CPUs & RTX 40 GPUs.
* **\[Throughout 2023\]**¬†Several users have started reporting game crashes and issues in high-profile AAA titles such as [Callisto Protocol](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgamingtechsupport/comments/18n7163/out_of_video_memory_on_a_brand_new_pc/) and [Hogwarts Legacy](https://www.reddit.com/r/HarryPotterGame/comments/10wftpn/hogwarts_legacy_out_of_video_memory_bug/) (among many others). Both tiles are based on Unreal Engine (released in 2023) and feature a shader compilation process at the start. There are currently thousands of such issues reported on Steam Community Forums and Reddit.
* **\[February 2024\]** A post by [Sebastian Castellanos](https://x.com/Sebasti66855537/status/1760034497045623121) brings the issue to the limelight, highlighting the ""worrying trend"" of stability issues affecting 14th and 13th-gen CPUs.
* **\[February 2024\]** [Our editor along with various other tech outlets](https://x.com/hms1193/status/1760246908927246634) start reporting the issue and bringing the matter on to the mainstream media. Quickly, it is pointed out that underclocking and undervolting the chips can result in better stability.
* **\[April 2024\]** NVIDIA [Issued a formal statement](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/game-ready-drivers/13/540532/geforce-grd-55212-feedback-thread-released-4424/) that the stability issues are not related to its GPUs but rather Intel CPUs.
* **\[April 2024\]** Intel [announces](https://wccftech.com/intel-13th-14th-gen-cpu-gaming-stability-investigated-chips-being-returned-in-korea/) its investigation of the reports of instability issues affecting 13th and 14th Gen CPUs.

I have been short Intel since July 15th.

**Edit:**

Ive received internal leaks from Intel employees explaining internal issues and intels failures.

Source 1:

The leading theory inside Intel right now, and it is just a theory, is that the Ring Bus is getting cooked because it's fed by the same rail as the P-Cores and E-Cores. 

Raptor Lake required incredibly high voltages that the clocks required to be competitive with Zen 4, and it seems like it was just pushed too hard. This is an inherent flaw that would be in Bartlett too it's overvolted. 

Meteor Lake isn't affected, and Emerald Rapids is unlikely be effected materially.



Source 2: 

I never worked directly on Raptor Lake \[Intel Design Engineer\], but I did have exposure to Alder Lake, and I can confirm that they were very concerned about the ring bus getting damaged if the voltage was pushed too high. 

I can also confirm that Raptor Lake was rushed through the design and validation process...



Source 3: 

I \[Intel Foundry Services\] can tell you that Raptor Lake was rushed through our Fab in Arizona in record time, but it's also produced in other fabs. However, this location (Arizona) is notable because I can confirm that there was an Oxidation issue caused by some failure in our HVAC system between March & June of 2023. 

It was so bad that Keyvan Esfarjani had to fly in to make decision about which wafers (which cost as much as a Model X each) needed to be thrown away.

To be clear, I don't know what decision was made, but I do know that this event DID happen. And by the way, it affected Sapphire Rapids yields as well...although I doubt it's an issue that wasn't "

My position 
Fellow degenerates, we stand on the brink of history. Forget SMCI, QQQ, even Tesla! Today, we fight for the future, the next great titan:INTEL ($INTC). This isn‚Äôt just a stock, this is the Infinity Stone of Tech Stocks. üíéü¶ç

We all laughed when Intel fell behind, when AMD and Nvidia seemed like the Thanos of chips. But Intel is Iron Man, baby. Old, reliable, and gearing up for the comeback of the century.

The Vision: Intel's long game is power efficiency, AI chips, and their 7nm breakthrough. You thought they were snapped out of existence? Wrong! They‚Äôve been in the Quantum Realm, grinding to make sure they can snap the competition away. They‚Äôre about to snap their competition into dust.

The Play: 
Options? You want 'em? Load up. Shares? Stack 'em. We‚Äôre not just hodling, we‚Äôre creating the next big **moon mission**. They‚Äôve got Arc GPUs, Meteor Lake, and a battle plan to take down the chip overlords.

THE BULL CASE:
- AI Chips: Think Wakanda tech. Ready to change the world.

We‚Äôre all in this together. Remember how the Avengers fought against impossible. They may have fallen, but they‚Äôre about to RISE UP.

üíéü¶ç HODL. BUY. BELIEVE.

Intel isn't just a stock. It‚Äôs a movement. The SNAP is coming.

The proposal does not yet include plans to split Intel and sell off its contract manufacturing operation, or foundry, to a buyer such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. ([TSM](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSM),¬†[2330.TW](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/2330.TW)), according to the source and another person familiar with the matter.

The presentation, including the plans around its manufacturing operations, are not yet finalized and could change ahead of the meeting.

Intel has already broken off its foundry business from its design business, and has been reporting its financial results separately since the first calendar quarter of this year.

The company has erected a wall between the design and manufacturing businesses to assure that potential customers of the design division would have no access to technology secrets of customers using Intel‚Äôs factories, known as fabs, to manufacture their chips.

Intel is suffering through one of its worst periods as it attempts to play catchup in the AI era against the likes of Nvidia ([NVDA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA)), the dominant AI chipmaker with a $3 trillion market capitalization. In contrast, Intel's has now sunk to below $100 billion after a disastrous second-quarter earnings report in August."

$INTC - A dumb person's retrospective,58,1ej04ru,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ej04ru/intc_a_dumb_persons_retrospective/,74,2024-08-03 15:59:48,"I'm lazy and you regards don't like to read so I'll leave it to bullet points and you can piece them together.

1. Intel was seen as a bargain in 2023 compared to NVDA and AMD after their 400% run up.

2. US gov have vested interest in Intel. No they are not propping Intel up, but it's effectively giving Intel a big loan to buy a second house. That loan can pay off if the housing market goes up, or they are double fucked because they leveraged to buy a second house.

3. If you bought Intel because china will invade Taiwan, you are really regarded. If China invades Taiwan, everything is going to sell. That's a disruption of global trade on WW2 levels. Your best case scenario still loses you money.

4. Intel bullish scenario is 18A, High-Na EUV paying dividends, early experience granting them a year technological lead over TSMC. It doesn't have to work, but the upside is a 10x from these levels. TSMC pass up High NA EUV is repeating the same decision Intel did in 2012 when Intel controlled the market and did not view EUV as economically feasible. Again, doesn't mean TSMC is incorrect in their assessment, but history does repeat itself.

5. Intel bearish scenario is just repeat of 2016 and delay after delay. In which case they head to legacy company status like Ford. Anyone else remember all the Ford bulls in 2016? They're not on this sub anymore because they all went broke.

6. I'm no crayon guy. But everyone can see that $30 was a magic line, and drastically going below it to $21 is a market signal that the company is now viewed fundamentally differently. Yes it can go lower, especially the general market trends change we see this week. 

7. AMD spent from 2008 to 2016 an absolute garbage penny stock. You WSBers nowadays don't even know how ridiculed you were for even considering AMD. 2015 to 2017 were peak AMD years on this sub when regards jumped the gun, bought calls because MUH mindfactory data and muh 1% min benchmarks losing them everything over and over again. You kids don't even know struggle. Struggle is putting your 1k paycheck on AMD calls every week thinking this week you will hit. Just to watch Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs dropping a $12 PT downgrade on you when the stock turns even a little bullish. The investment only somewhat paid off in 2018 when AMD traded to 30, but then half the regards lost everything (myself included) when it crashed to 18 in 2 months following Powell's rate hike.

8. Look how quickly sentiment changed for AMD from 2018. This very well could be history repeating itself, as the semiconductor companies have demonstrated over and over again. Intel 18A is a repeat situation of AMD ZEN. The upside cannot be understated.

8. I'm still bullish. Proper execution can bring the company to a $200+ stock. I bought and sold Intel throughout the year. 8000 shares from 35 to 50, sold at 43, bought at 35, sold at 30 before earnings. I was up 130k, lost 100k of it. Bought 2500 shares at 21.30. I think it can go lower in the short term, wouldn't be surprised for it to momentarily touch below 20."

1. Their 18A process is best in class
2. Their x86 chips will be way more efficient on 18A
3. The ARM chips on 18A will be more efficient than competitors
4. Their GPUs are only a generation or two behind Nvidia.
5. Their AI platform (gaudi)  is already more efficient that Nvidia and is only a generation or two behind in terms of raw horsepower.

If we think about compute in general let's say 33% cloud, 33% HPC/AI, 33% edge.  

Right now Intel is a major player in all 3 markets.

Xeon isn't going anywhere and once 18A process starts moving volumes it will be such a huge jump in performance that all these cloud vendors that have been extending lifecycles will finally have a reason to upgrade.

Gaudi will become more competitive over time as companies start to realize that nuclear power stations for data centers are not really a good idea. The power density required for nvidias chips just isn't sustainable.

ARM is a big threat to Intels x86 market but it's also a big opportunity for Intel foundry. The efficiency of ARM chip design is largely the same given they're using the same core architectures. Where Apple really has been excelling is using the latest process technologies to build more efficient edge compute. Intel with their state of the art 18A coming online around the world will soon having companies lined up for ARM production that will handily outperform TSMCs latest offering.

Intel GPUs are getting more and more competitive with Nvidia every generation. In terms of gaming I see them becoming a more and more of a thorn in nvidias side, but that's just GPUs...

I just don't see why nvda can be possibly worth 20x Intel when Intel has so many more growth opportunities. If all goes well in the world then Intel will continue to play a major role in the global compute market. If all goes to hell in the world then Intel will be the single most critical company in the world as global chip supply becomes completely disrupted in Taiwan and Intel's new factories become the only way to keep our world moving forward.

Already Biden is escalating the trade war with China. Imagine if it gets to the point where the US decides to permanently dismantle TSMC's entire manufacturing capacity then imagine what that will do to global chip supply. All it would take is one wrong move by China to seize control over the strait and USA will undoubtedly destroy the manufacturing before letting it fall under Chinese control.

Intel (INTC) Bear thesis for Earnings,82,1ehij4j,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ehij4j/intel_intc_bear_thesis_for_earnings/,62,2024-08-01 20:17:40,"Intel has had a rough month.  If you browse the r/pcmasterrace you will see numerous threads about how Intel's most recent line of chips frequently throw errors and cause numerous problems in applications.  This issue has also received decent attention in the press and it effects their entire line of most recent chips, including the commercial sector and server consumers; this issue is not limited to retail consumers.  Intel's response to these reports has been a bit schizo; first denying the problem exists, then claiming they found the issue and had a fix lined up, then announcing there was no possible fix and most recently denying that there would be a recall despite the faults in their product.  This behavior has had a negative impact on consumer sentiment for the company.

  
Recently in the news Intel has announced mass layoffs, there is even a recent thread about his in WSB; this is not a good look as a company enters earnings.  If Earnings were good we wouldn't expect an announcement of mass layoffs, it is another bearish indicator as Intel enters earnings after market closes today.

  
Looking a little deeper into the most recent earnings report and comparing them with google's stock graph over the year, you can see that with the last two earnings reports INTC dropped immediately following earnings.  The last earnings report drop is the most interesting to me since even though Intel reported a slight beat in earnings, the stock dropped over 10% the next day.  I believe the earnings report coming tonight will be very bad for Intel and we will see a similar drop in stock price to what occurred the previous 2 earnings as past behavior is the best indicator of future behavior.

  
Counterthesis:  I'm not overly confident in this play.  INTC has dropped around 4% over the last week.  It's possible that investors have already ""priced in"" the expected bad numbers into the upcoming earnings; if so while the earnings report will definitely be bad regardless, they may beat the expected terrible earnings with mere bad numbers and the stock may stay flat or even rise slightly; this is especially true since investors are aware of mass layoffs which will reduce expected costs for the upcoming quarter.

  
Taken as a whole I expect a drop following Intels reported earnings and have bought puts on INTC expiring 2Aug 2024 as a result:

But after digging into it, I don‚Äôt think Intel‚Äôs troubles are over. They‚Äôve been losing ground in the mobile and AI markets, and the competition in the PC processor space is brutal. The CEO is doing his best to turn things around, but big changes like selling off unprofitable segments (like Altera or Mobileye) or spinning off their foundry‚Äîif the rumors are true‚Äîwon‚Äôt happen overnight. Meanwhile, they‚Äôre still burning cash in these areas.

On top of that, Intel‚Äôs dealing with chip defects and warranty costs are going to be hurt. Their Meteor Lake production is facing bottlenecks, and while they‚Äôve launched Lunar Lake, it‚Äôs too early to tell how sales will go. Plus, the export ban to China is another blow to their revenue.

INTC 2026 Leap : Bull Case,0,1eifepq,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1eifepq/intc_2026_leap_bull_case/,50,2024-08-02 22:36:03,"**Background**

High-NA EUV lithography represents a significant leap forward in semiconductor manufacturing technology, poised to dominate over traditional EUV systems. This advanced technology employs an increased numerical aperture of 0.55, compared to 0.33 in current EUV systems, enabling the production of even smaller and more intricate features on silicon wafers. The higher numerical aperture allows for sharper imaging and improved resolution, pushing the boundaries of chip manufacturing into the angstrom era.

Intel has *secured a crucial first-mover advantage by acquiring ASML's entire 2024 stock* of High-NA EUV machines. This strategic move includes five to six units, each valued at approximately $370 million, with the first machine already delivered and assembled at Intel's Oregon facility in early 2024. By monopolizing the initial production run of these cutting-edge tools, Intel has positioned itself at the forefront of semiconductor technology advancement. This aggressive acquisition strategy provides Intel with several key advantages:

1. Technological leadership: Intel will be the first to integrate High-NA EUV into its manufacturing processes, potentially leapfrogging competitors in transistor density and chip performance.
2. Process optimization: Early access allows Intel to refine its manufacturing techniques and overcome initial challenges before competitors even receive their machines.
3. Attracting partnerships: Intel's advanced capabilities may draw high-profile customers like Microsoft and potentially Nvidia to its foundry services.
4. Market positioning: This move could help Intel reverse its recent foundry business losses and reclaim its position as a leading semiconductor manufacturer.
5. Ecosystem development: Intel can start building the necessary infrastructure and expertise around High-NA EUV technology, creating a significant barrier to entry for latecomers.

With competitors like Samsung and SK Hynix potentially waiting until the second half of 2025 for their High-NA EUV equipment, Intel has secured a critical time advantage in the race to develop and commercialize next-generation semiconductor technologies. This head start could translate into a substantial competitive edge in the rapidly evolving chip industry, potentially reshaping the semiconductor landscape in Intel's favor.

Intel lost out on this cycle of silicon because TSMC had bought up all the ASML EUV machine 5-7 years ago.

Now, that Intel has secured next generation NA-EUV machines, it's in a much strong position for the next silicon cycle

**EUV**

It's important to note that while TSMC currently leads in EUV-based chip manufacturing, companies like Samsung and Intel are working hard to catch up. Intel, for example, has made significant investments in R&D and has secured early access to ASML's next-generation High NA EUV machines in an attempt to regain technological leadership.

TSMC currently utilizes Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography for its advanced semiconductor nodes. As of now, TSMC's most advanced node in production using EUV is the 3nm (N3) process. This node features up to 25 EUV layers, with some layers using EUV double-patterning to achieve higher logic and SRAM transistor density compared to the previous 5nm node. TSMC has also detailed its roadmap for future nodes, including the 2nm (N2) process expected around 2025, and the 1.4nm node anticipated around 2028. The 1nm node is projected to be introduced around 2031.¬†However, these future nodes may require the adoption of High-NA EUV tools, which TSMC plans to adopt by [2030. In](http://2030.In) summary, TSMC's current EUV capabilities allow for the production of 3nm nodes, with plans to advance to smaller nodes in the coming years.

**NA-EUV**

High-NA EUV (High Numerical Aperture Extreme Ultraviolet) lithography is the next generation of semiconductor manufacturing technology designed to enable the production of even smaller and more densely packed transistors on computer chips.Key points about High-NA EUV:

1. Improved resolution: High-NA EUV increases the numerical aperture from 0.33 in current EUV systems to 0.55, allowing for sharper imaging and smaller feature sizes.
2. Smaller transistors: It enables chipmakers to print transistors 1.7 times smaller and achieve transistor densities 2.9 times higher than current EUV systems.
3. Anamorphic optics: High-NA EUV uses an innovative anamorphic optical design that demagnifies the pattern by 4x in one direction and 8x in the other, allowing for better resolution while maintaining compatibility with existing reticle sizes.

High-NA EUV lithography offers several advantages over traditional EUV lithography, primarily in terms of resolution, process complexity, and cost-effectiveness. Here are the key reasons why High-NA EUV is considered better:

**Lower Edge Placement Error**

* High-NA EUV reduces the cumulative edge placement error associated with mask splits in multi-patterning processes. This improvement leads to better alignment and higher fidelity in the final patterns, which is critical for advanced nodes.

**Enhanced Design Flexibility**

* The improved imaging window of High-NA EUV allows for more complex design elements to be implemented on a single mask. This flexibility is beneficial for designing advanced semiconductor devices with intricate features.

**Higher Yield**

* By reducing the number of processing steps required, High-NA EUV can improve yield. Fewer steps mean fewer opportunities for defects to be introduced, which is essential for maintaining high production yields at advanced nodes Lower Edge Placement Error.

**NA-EUV and AI**

Angstrom-scale chip design represents a significant advancement in semiconductor technology that could potentially facilitate running local large language models (LLMs) on smartphones. Here's how angstrom chips could enable this:

1. Increased transistor density: Angstrom-scale processes allow for even more transistors to be packed onto a single chip compared to nanometer-scale designs. This increased density enables more powerful and efficient processors that can handle the computational demands of LLMs.
2. Improved power efficiency: With advanced transistor structures like gate-all-around (GAA), angstrom-scale chips can achieve better power efficiency. This is crucial for running resource-intensive LLMs on battery-powered devices like smartphones.
3. Enhanced memory scaling: GAA structures may allow for better memory scaling compared to current designs. This could provide the necessary memory capacity and bandwidth required to run LLMs locally on mobile devices.
4. Backside power distribution: This technique, which moves power distribution under the transistors, frees up more space for signal routing. This can lead to better overall chip performance and efficiency, which is essential for running complex AI models on mobile devices.
5. Multi-die systems: Angstrom-scale processes can be combined with multi-die system designs, allowing for more specialized and efficient chips that could be optimized for AI workloads like LLMs.

While angstrom-scale chips are still in development and not yet commercially available, some smartphone manufacturers are already working on incorporating LLMs into their devices. Chinese companies like Huawei and Xiaomi are reportedly integrating LLMs into their smartphones.¬†This trend suggests that as chip technology advances, we may see more powerful and efficient processors capable of running increasingly sophisticated LLMs locally on mobile devices.

Intel may be the foundry to print the chips needed for Iphone and Android LLM in 2027

Intel is currently in talks with 12 potential customers that finance chief David Zinsner said will generate some revenue in 2026 and additional cash in 2027. The company has decided not to market its 20A manufacturing process in favor of focusing on the more advanced 18A manufacturing process, the CFO said.

The foundry business currently generates revenue from its advanced packaging business, Zinsner said.

Zinsner did not directly address the reports on Wednesday about Intel failing to produce viable test wafers for Broadcom, a potential manufacturing customer.

The Santa Clara, California-based company is amid a turnaround plan that includes shedding a number of businesses and a 15% cut to its staff. CEO Pat Gelsinger and other key executives are expected to present plans to the company‚Äôs board of directors at a mid-September meeting.

Cuts to the company will mostly be completed by the time Intel announces the current quarter‚Äôs earnings, Zinsner said. The company is considering a wide range of options as it ponders what to cut or keep.

The company is ""not likely to see money"" until the end of the year from the U.S. CHIPS Act, Zinsner said. The act is allocating billions in grants and other incentives to spur chip manufacturing in the United States.

2 years ago when NVDA was under $300 I said they really have no peer in this space. I said it will probably triple in a 2 years even at it's inflated price.

https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qw9glx/im_surprised_there_isnt_more_nvda_talk_before/

I was playing golf at my club and guys who were 60+ on the tee box were talking nvda and smci and everything they said was wrong.  Then I walked into the restaurant to eat and again I heard the boomer pro talking about it. Funny thing was I remember him dogging on it when it was sub 200 having too high a PE

I had a plan and my limit order sold at 900 awhile back but when my mom asked about NVDA I just had that sinking feeling like she asked my about my decentralized currency when it hit ath but my limit order had not filled .  I remember her asking about my currency around nov 2021 at thanksgiving which was literally the top, and again at thxgiving or christmas years prior in 2013 and 2017 she again called the top.

Bless her but my mom and boomers have a way of warning about the top.

EDIT: I just think it‚Äôs way harder for a company like NVDA which owns 99% of datacenter GPU to keep that 99% and I already seeing AMD, QCOM, ARM, AMZN, MSFT, GOOG, Meta making their own and making in roads and chipping 1% here and there.  

Much like any IT person who worked in datacenters and colocations pre 2016 saw INTC own 99% of datacenter.  It was easy to see it‚Äôs very hard to keep 99% and when you lose a few % the ‚Äústreet‚Äù or ‚Äúmarket‚Äù pivots quickly.  

5+ years ago I said AMD at $1.80 I said INTC would start shedding that 99% dominance.  

https://np.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/9v1n6f/amazon_web_services_aws_pricing_amd_vs_intel/e994dka/

When you own 99% of the market imo once the pivot happens, it‚Äôs almost like a landslide in stock price. And it moves in cycles, companies will buy a bunch of NVDA GPUs and they might add a little bit the next year or the year after but you won‚Äôt have large purchases.  No one is buying 1 billion dollars of GPUs every year or quarter.  This business cycles and when it goes down it‚Äôll go down for 2 years and rocket up after when people need to bulk order."
$INTC as serious AI inference play,45,1bu9xzl,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bu9xzl/intc_as_serious_ai_inference_play/,54,2024-04-03 02:36:20,"I keep reading posts about Intel and consumer CPU's or GPU's. It is relatively insignificant if they sell some shitty GPU's for a new xbox. The real money is in datacenters and AI, specifically AI accelerators and inference chips for training / running models quickly. Nvidia has been the king with their monopoly-like features (optimisation, their ecosystem, CUDA, etc..), but Intel is making some serious moves. 

In the latest MLPerf benchmark from just a few days ago, which tests AI chips on tasks like object detection and large language models, Intel's Gaudi 2 is showing impressive results. Not to get too technical, but even David Salvator, Nvidia director of accelerated computing products, acknowledged that Intel's chip is actually competitive \[1\]. While Nvidia remains on top, price / performance wise Gaudi 2 beat them in Stable Diffusion and was close in the large language model. (Yes this is only inference - so does not reflect training, but this still shows potential). Intel said Gaudi 2 delivered a massive 1.42x jump in performance compared to their previous gen in just one year.

The generative AI market is estimated to hit $1.3 trillion by 2032, and we're in a unique position to guess who will be selling the shovels. As a bonus: Intel will be hugely susceptible to being hyped up during an AI bubble.

Besides all this, we know that the Biden admin just announced Intel is getting up to $8.5B in direct funding under the CHIPS Act, along with a 25% tax credit on over $100B in investments and eligibility for $11B in federal loans.

Intel could be a hedge against Nvidia, as they rely on TSMC. If geopolitical shit hits the fan, it could affect TSMC, which would impact Nvidia, AMD, Apple, and many others leaving intel as the only serious option.

**TLDR**: Intel's AI Chip is no Nvidia killer yet, but Intel's making solid progress. $INTC could be an interesting AI play. Pie is big enough.

"If you missed the NVDA train, buy ARM",1208,1b8499a,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1b8499a/if_you_missed_the_nvda_train_buy_arm/,649,2024-03-06 22:07:49,"Summary: I fully expect Nvidia and Jensen Huang to go after ARM and acquire a (rather large) stake at any moment, possibly as soon as lockup expires next week. If Trump wins election and FTC changes leadership, Nvidia will likely try to acquire ARM outright. 

Background: In late September 2020, [Nvidia announced plans to acquire ARM from Softbank](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-to-acquire-arm-for-40-billion-creating-worlds-premier-computing-company-for-the-age-of-ai) for $40 billion. At that time, NVDA was \~ $400 billion company, 10x the value of ARM. In December 2021, the [FTC sues to block the merger](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2021/12/ftc-sues-block-40-billion-semiconductor-chip-merger) citing anti-competitive advantages the combined firm would do in the AI race. On February 2022, Nvidia and Softbank announce [the termination of Nvidia acquitition of ARM Holdings](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-and-softbank-group-announce-termination-of-nvidias-acquisition-of-arm-limited) and Softbank immediately announced plans to IPO ARM. ARM would IPO in September of 2023. 

All the major tech companies in the world (Microsoft, Google, Apple, Samsung, Qualcomm, Broadcom, AMD, META, Tesla, and many many others) are working to design their own chips, most are based on [ARM architecture](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2023/11/09/how-arm-gained-chip-dominance-with-apple-nvidia-amazon-and-qualcomm.html) and Jensen Huang sees the writing on the wall. Jensen also knows that his main competitors, including some of the big boys, are also champing at the bit to either get their own stake or prevent Nvidia from cornering the entire market outright. It's a race against the inevitable. 

If Nvidia was successful in acquiring ARM back in 2021, those $40 billion NVDA shares would be worth $220 billion to Softbank today if we go by the 10x valuation metric that both Nvidia and Softbank likely agreed upon back in 2020. 

TL;DR: Missed NVDA run, buy ARM shares or leaps. Not investment advice!

Yes, it's massively capital intensive, but when you see those ""losses"" reported, think depreciation - not actual cash burn. It's accounting games to squeeze more government incentives.  The $7B loss is so overstated.

Could INTC dip a bit further? Maybe. But the downside seems limited, while $48 by summer-end feels very achievable as a first upside target. If it can reclaim and hold above $48, I'll double down on my position. Anything less and I'll probably cut and run.

I've been using SMCI hardware for 15+ years.  It's cheaper, than HP, Dell Cisco, Lenovo and that's about it, it doesn't have any technical advantage.  Their support, and IPMI is sub par, quality can be hit or miss.  I've used them on off, depending on budgets.  

I've been in datacenters in Asia seen the same no name hardware with the same design as Super micro, the power supplies, air shrouds, everything was interchangeable and fit.  I could probably slide in a blade from these cheap no name server into their blade chassis and it'd all run fine. There's nothing inherently special or AI about SMCI hardware.

I don't watch Cramer but I have to assume him or some network, bank is saying SMCI is some get rich AI play.  It's got a catchy AI buzz name but that's it.

INTC Outlook and Marketcap vs Assets,24,1cnx1t9,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1cnx1t9/intc_outlook_and_marketcap_vs_assets/,38,2024-05-09 18:46:26,"Why is foundry for Intel so important, despite only being a minor part of the company?

Their vertical integration makes both the consumer and server segments highly dependent on foundry. Although the upcoming Arrow Lake processors will be partially based on TSMC nodes, freeing those segments from their dependence, while still keeping all the benefits if foundry becomes competitve again. So long term consumer and server can only benefit from foundry and worst case survive on their own.

While 7B losses in foundry and news about Q2 earnings were quite bad and caused this bearish situation. Intel is still on track with foundry for 2024 with 20A and 2025 with 18A and 14A. 18A and 14A will be their first nodes ever, that will be sold over Intel foundry to other companies. Of course foundry is a very hard to ramp up business, that only generates profits in the long term, so investors had too much short term confidence in Intel's foundry business around 2021, that now dies off, before it can even generate it's first revenue.

I am certain Intel CPU's on TSMC nodes will be competitive, especially since intel ordered 3nm, giving it an edge over Amd (1)

So that leaves two options:

1. Foundry is sucessfull in the next 3-5 years:

=> Intel consumer and server profit from vertical integration and outcompete everything else on the market, while Intel can sell expensive nodes to other conpanies with a high profit margin

2. Foundry is not sucessfull:

=> Intel still profits by producing cheap nodes, for non performance critical parts of SoCs in house while staying competitive in server and consumer using TSMC. For the same reasons some capacity could still be sold to other companies at normal market rates, not turning huge profits, but breaking even.

Intel's Marketcap right now at 30$ per stock is around 130B, while it's net assets are valued at 192.7B. (2)

I only see Intel making progress from here on. As an investor I feel even safer knowing they are severly undervalued right now, even ignoring future foundry growth potential.

I for my part bought the dip, but remember I am highly regarded.

INTC the sleeping giant,115,qnwkfx,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qnwkfx/intc_the_sleeping_giant/,157,2021-11-06 14:40:16,"Hi fellow retards, been a fellow lurker for a few years now but decided to post because I recently shifted my stance on $INTC and figured I should get the full smooth-brain experience by getting roasted by my fellow apes.  

TLDR: Intel is making all the moves to hire good talent to get fabrication and R&D back on track, they have the cash to do it, and DoD has stepped in to make sure they succeed in the wake of the China scares. Moreover, Intel is moving to offer foundry to other companies, which means that it don‚Äôt matter whether your team pro AMD or NVIDIA, they will likely be manufacturing for most US companies in the next 3 years.  

I figured Intel was done for ever since they stopped making significant progress on their chip performance and neglected their foundry, and was on the AMD hype-train ever since Ryzen 2 launched. However, a lot has changed on the global stage and on Intel‚Äôs strategy which signals a new outlook for Intel in the next year. 

First of all, Intel has seen the writing on the wall. They have gotten sloppy and greedy for too long and have seen their bottom line and image hit the shitter. In response, they have started hiring the talent they need to get their foundry and R&D back on track. They recently hired [Vineet Goel](https://www.crn.com/news/components-peripherals/intel-hires-top-amd-gpu-architect-to-lead-xe-ip-roadmap) from AMD to work on GPU architecture, and have hired a slew of [veterans and new talent](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16807/intel-continues-to-rehire-veterans-at-some-point-theyll-run-out) as part of their revamping and have finally started to [move in the right direction](https://www.pcworld.com/article/549611/intel-core-i5-12600k-review.html/amp). Intel definitely sees how they‚Äôve lost their edge to AMD and NVIDIA and are making sure they hire the right talent to turn the tide. They also have deeper pockets than AMD and NVIDIA to make sure this happens (34.6B vs just 3.6B and 7.7B respectively). 

On the other hand, the political stage has completely shifted, and China and the US are more than just on bad footing, as the FBI officially note that . [china is ‚Äúa threat to our economic security‚Äîand by extension, to our national security‚Äù](https://www.fbi.gov/news/speeches/the-threat-posed-by-the-chinese-government-and-the-chinese-communist-party-to-the-economic-and-national-security-of-the-united-states). As a result, the US government is currently in a race to decouple as quick as possible from china, and no decoupling is more important than that of the chip-manufacturing industry. 

There is only 1, US-based chip manufacturer, and if you‚Äôre also smooth brained, you likely know it‚Äôs INTEL. Everyone else just designs in the US and manufactures in Asia, which is an issue because the next big player, TSMC is increadibly close to getting rammed by China because china want‚Äôs to [take over Taiwan](https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2021-11-03/china-clearly-developing-ability-to-invade-taiwan-top-general-says). This leaves the US government as well as the  entire private industry up in the air if and when China invades Taiwan (or even just makes shipping to/from Taiwan harder). 

You know who has deeper pockets than Intel? The DoD and they‚Äôve basically decided that Intel has to be the leader for the sake of the entire private industry and US national security ([see here](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-wins-us-project-develop-foundry-ecosystem.html#gs.f1t2zi).

Intel will be a big mover going forward because they want to win, the US government needs them to step up their game, and cash is clearly not and will not be an issue. More importantly, Intel is going to be more than just a cpu vendor, they are likely going to be the main foundry for most american chip designers like AMD, Nvidia, Apple and Qualcomm"

Intel recently replaced its CEO with [Pat Gelsinger](https://newsroom.intel.com/news-releases/intel-appoints-tech-industry-leader-pat-gelsinger-as-new-ceo/). He worked at VMWare as their CEO and has worked at Intel when he was 18.

Based on the success of [Tiger lake](https://www.theverge.com/21440302/intel-tiger-lake-hands-on-tests-core-i7-1185g7-processor-release) this might put intel back into the game. They are also releasing [a GPU](https://www.pcgamer.com/intel-xe-hpg-tease-3dmark-mesh-shader/) soon. For more news like this, I would watch GamerNexus( Bot won't let me link it) who does really great reviews from the technical standpoint. They are planned to release 3nm and 5nm chips later this year or in 2022( They are just getting the contracts right now. No date yet). Also, they had an outstanding year despite losing their crown to $AMD back in Q4.

Just on their own their looking to bounce right back up from the pandemic. They still have some grow room from a lower revenue year. I bet this stock could go to $90 or even to $100 with rocket lake, and that's a short term gain meaning tendies in time for summer. But what about the long term or market correction.

# Data Analysis

|CompanyMarket|Market cap|Dividends /share price|Q4 '20 revenue|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|$INTC|250.07 billion|0.0213557676751335|20 billion|

|$NVDA|370.44 Billion|0.0010694293591779|3.11 billion|

As someone who has been in the hardware space and is up to date on info Intel is underpriced compared to $AMD and $NVDA. What was holding intel back was the management and it changed. Intel is about to beat AMD and I would hop on the spaceship before it goes to the moon. so what is a reasonable price?

if intel sock matches $AMD's Market Cap to revenue then its market cap would go to 700 billion. The positive press of the stock could bring it to 750 billion. But Intel's revenue is about to spike. President Joe Biden is planning to increase supply and if Intel can take advantage of that they can produce more chips where chips are out of stock. In 2020 GPU's sold out in a second leaving gamers without new gear. The 1050 ti, a failure when it came out, got rereleased and became one of the biggest successes this year. that's how desperate people are. [r/pcmasterrace](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/) was hit the hardest and many of them want the fastest gear. Intel could fill this void left by AMD and NVDA. if Intel can get enough stuff out then I could see a 500 billion market cap( with market correction, meaning that intel gets a fair price).

I currently do not have a position in INTC right now, but I plan to do so as soon as my wife's boyfriend will let me.

to conclude this for now I look at Nvdia valuations, and i see high multiples attached to a company with a concentrated customer base whereby the bulk of their revenus comes from four customers using old slow h100 chips amd the ceo is dumping shares at what appears to be a bubble I look at Intel, who just launched the Gaudi 3 and already has.20 customers, and the chip outperforms the h100 . Then, I look at the multiples and see it's undervalued, and the insiders are buying shares . this is a shift in paradigms, and I, for one, will not be on the wrong side of this .""

at a minimum, keep your NVDA and add INTC

Today we are going to talk about INTC. A bunch of fukin üåà üêª decided that AMD was kicking ass in the 7nm sector and this true. However, after bleeding out on Thursday and Friday, it seems INTC has finally turned towards TENDIE TOWN. THE BOTTOM IS HERE AND ITS TIME TO RIDE THE ROCKET TO THE MOON.

Some of you are unfamiliar with TENDIE TOWN as you are on the end of the spectrum, borderline vegetable status. Let me elaborate. This mystical place is for those of you who **do not** turn to $ROPE when their weeklies inevitably expire worthless. This land has the tendiest of tendies. Those  tendies with the ultimate crunch unseen to the plebians investing in CDs. Did i mention you have access to your wife for one evening every month? I know, sounds like bullshit, but it's true! Just ask my wife's boyfriend, he can vouch.

&#x200B;

Let me explain that INTC  is going to the fuckin moon because they have been and will continue being an industry leader. $19.7b in revenue for Q2? You must be a dumbass to think INTC is going tits up any time soon. 

INTC 2019 revenue was $70b. Did you read that correctly? $70,000,000,000. Thats $70b more than you've ever seen your account because you yolo SPY weeklies like the autist you are.  2020 revenue is projected to be $75b. If 3rd grade math is too tough for you that is a 7% gain over last year. THIS IS WITHOUT 7nm CHIPS SO WHO GIVES A FUK ABOUT THEM.

Ex-dividend date is 8/6 so people gonna be buying up for that sweet sweet dividend cash 

&#x200B;

Stop being stupid and get aboard the Tendie Train so maybe your wife's boyfriend lets you speak to her for the first time since Covid you retards.

&#x200B;

Oh no, AMD did jump 5% today, maybe because its been hyped up so much by the ever-flowing sea of retards coming from WSB to yolo their life savings on something that has ran up 49% this year.

or go yolo some more SPY weeklies, I don't give a fuck.

TL;DR INTC up 23% up Q1 YoY INTC up 20% Q2 YoY; 2020 expectations 7% YoY. Fuk Bears;

Well guess what? Time for some karma you rainbow bellied bitch.

I'll never judge a someone for hedging their portfolio, but actively hoping for death, destruction and widespread bankruptcy is another thing entirely.

It's not very nice to want to see the world burn, so that you can make some money.

The next few weeks will tell that just like every other time we thought the end was here - the world is not actually going to cave in on itself.

I will bet you all my money (and I have) that the bottom was Monday.

Reasons why Monday was peak fear:

* The world is beginning to relax a bit as we understand that USA and Russia are not going to nuke each other
* Europe will not lose access to it's energy
* Fertilizers will not be sanctioned, and the crisis will not trigger a global famine
* Despite what the headlines say, Russia was not cut off entirely from SWIFT. Only some banks were.
* Both sides want some form of peace
* Just by looking at the inflationary data from 2021, you can see that we are about to hit an inflection point in inflation growth. The rise in inflation will start slowing until the actual YOY growth rate of inflation starts falling below 8%, then 7%, then 5% etc. Price levels will not fall, but the growth rate will.
* Oil is falling, and is taking pressure off inflation.
* The markets WANT interest rate hikes now. That means the rate hike today is GOOD NEWS.
* On Monday, SPY tested the 200 day and 50 day MA death cross. We bounced.
* Jerome Powell is about to whisper sweet soothing nothings into our ears, like he always does.

So in closing, if you were literally cheering for a global catastrophe in the form of WW3 and hyperinflation so that your stocks would go up:

# You. Are. A. Terrible. Person.

If that's you cheering for pain, fuck you and you deserve your losses.

I plan on owning this company for the long haul. I believe in the future of global semiconductor manufacturing and I can see Intel's place in the global semiconductor fabricator space.

Nearly every other chip designer abandoned fabs because businesses operate best when they focus on what they do best. Intel is unique in that it is set up to transform the business into a major foundry model going forward. That takes decades of investment which Intel is ahead on.

One day, Intel may fabricate chips for Nvidia, AMD, Texas Instruments, Apple, Qualcomm, and Microsoft. This is due to their potential leadership in silicon photonics and quantum computing.

I wouldn't count Intel out just yet! 1.1 P/B ratio was really cheap, so I bought 2500 shares. I am paying down the margin with 95% of my wages. I have a feeling that I might be back to make another post (both gains and losses) relatively soon. Wish me luck!"

INTC - Catalysts for a breakout of all time high and the road to Trillion dollar market cap üöÄüöÄüöÄ,48,ljx97i,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljx97i/intc_catalysts_for_a_breakout_of_all_time_high/,150,2021-02-15 02:30:14,"Hello again lazy slush brained degenerates. I'm putting rocket emojis just for you guys! I know you love them  **üöÄ**  **üöÄ**

&#x200B;

TLDR: There are a few short term catalysts that can propel this sleeper stock to the moon. Buy INTC on Tuesday, or wait till the end of the week and see if I am right and its at near 70$ and buy then. Or just wait till its already overvalued and spiked parabolically to enter as usual.

&#x200B;

Yesterday I expressed (but not nearly enough) how Intel is like a beautiful meal. You got an appetizer yesterday with Mobileye and today I planned on giving you a dessert focused on Intel's AI/machine learning/neural network play but ill leave that for another day like I will with the main dish (Data).

&#x200B;

Ill wait for the price to be more ripe (which it will in the coming weeks) to expose these valuable long term prospects for the legacy chipmaker. I think you will take my valuations more seriously when INTC is around 70$ per share.

&#x200B;

Today I want to look at possible catalysts for INTCs 2021 bull run.

&#x200B;

1.) The most obvious is one that is already partially in play, and also partially responsible for INTCs 24% YTD returns. The changing of leadership at Intel. As you might know this Monday (markets closed) Pat Gelsinger officially takes over as CEO of Intel. Catalyst 1.1 was his appointment, catalyst 1.2 is him stepping in officially as CEO and his first announcements. When he stepped in for the earnings call last month he mentioned he had many ideas and thoughts that he would share publicly when he was officially in the role and had a chance to look through things more carefully (which he has been doing lately). There is guaranteed to be interesting chatter in the grapevines this coming week. If you believe Pat is one of the good ones this chatter is bound to be positive. Ill leave your uncreative brains to think of the myriad possibilites of the things Pat can say in the first few days/weeks that can tremendously impact the market price and corporate perception.  **üöÄ**

&#x200B;

Small side note, the leadership change is not exclusive to Pat, there are several top silicon valley pros coming back at Pats request (some returning from retirement). INTC knows it has been hit and is rallying its troops. All hands on deck to get this shit rolling back to the top. These people don't fuck around and they bleed Intel.

&#x200B;

2.) Semiconductor shortage. As you may or may not know there is a relatively large chip shortage that is affecting many industries. GM for example had to shut down two of its plants recently, but this is not just affecting the auto industry, it is affecting dozens of different industries (some more than others). What does this mean for Intel? Well, Intel makes chips. They have the largest foundries in the world and there are at least a handful of ways a company like Intel can leverage this situation to their advantage.  **üöÄ**  **üöÄ**

&#x200B;

3.) This one is at least in part linked to the second point, but goes beyond that. Biden administration intervention in the US semiconductor industry. Last week the SIA (Semiconductor industry association sent a letter to President Biden calling for governmental support of the industry). Please read the one page letter, and your conclusion will be the same as mine. This rally call is exceptionally bullish for the industry. [https://www.semiconductors.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/SIA-Letter-to-Pres-Biden-re-CHIPS-Act-Funding.pdf](https://www.semiconductors.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/SIA-Letter-to-Pres-Biden-re-CHIPS-Act-Funding.pdf) It is especially bullish though for one of the signatories of the letter: Intel. Intel unlike AMD actually makes the chips and does not outsource the production to a foreign company (a Taiwanese company for that matter (risks associated with this I have discussed in another post)). Having an actual American fab is extremely big both short term and long term. This is a national asset and Intels future and well being is intertwined with Americas. Any Presidential administration will come to this conclusion. What does this mean? It is in the best interest of the United States for Intel to be bigger, richer and more dominant than TSMC and there are many ways American top brass can go about this.  **üöÄ**  **üöÄ**  **üöÄ**

&#x200B;

Expect tax breaks and subsidies soon (that will asymmetrically impact Intel positively). In fact, as part of Covid relief packages you can expect executive action pretty here pretty soon.

&#x200B;

4.) Look at the power of memes and momentum over the last year. The market has been permanently tainted and so the unexpected can happen. Intel is one of the few profitable tech companies that has not shot parabolically (yet) although from a technical standpoint its starting to hint at that this year. Soon people especially retail will want a play that hasn't already been exhausted, that can still give them strong returns. I mean is it really appetizing to buy TSLA or even AMD after they have multiplied so much? There is a cognitive bias for a pre parabolic company with potential, and in a parabolic industry (semis). This bias may not be super rational but if price action continues to side with INTC it will be part of the reinforcement process for the potential parabolic play. You get this stock to be memetic and it flies.  **üöÄ**  **üöÄ**  **üöÄ**  **üöÄ**

&#x200B;

5.) Strong market correction. As you know many smart and stupid analysts have been predicting a crash since last March. They have all turned out to be wrong (so far). Last week though several bearish indicators started reappearing (from bearish insider transaction numbers, yield on the 10 year, and the bizarre VIX action). To be clear I do not think the market will crash anytime soon and I'm quite bullish on all sectors for the coming months (so long as the fed and white house play along(and they have no reason to not until inflation actually passes 2% or something crazy happens with commodities including that coin that cant be named)).

&#x200B;

In any case in the event a crash happens INTC will be in a much better position than most. Speculation in the stock is low for now, large long term (boomer holders). The company has very little debt and is extremely cash rich. It can self fund all its operations for years and even lose revenues. Essentially Intel is an underleveraged company. AMD and NVIDIA for example are much more leveraged companies as is normal with rapidly growing tech companies. The reality is a market crash would damage the competition much more than it would INTC and it could even benefit Intel's market share.

&#x200B;

Further if the correction is not a full blown panic it is quite possible that Intel may actually appreciate in price as the majority of the nasdaq depreciates (again due to risk perception and lack of leverage) Intel can easily be seen as a safehaven.  **üöÄ**  **üöÄ**  **üöÄ**  **üöÄ**  **üöÄ**

&#x200B;

I get it, its not easy for you to part with your emotional investment in NVIDIA and AMD, besides they have treated you spectacularly especially the past year. You like their product and are angry at the fact INTC has been treating their retail customers poorly the last few years. You are sick of the machinations of the INTC leadership and their total focus on $$ losing track of the most important thing, product quality.

&#x200B;

Don't let the past cloud your judgment for future investment opportunities.

&#x200B;

You see Intel has its tentacles in everything that matters related to chips. They truly are Chipzilla as you will discover, in time.

&#x200B;

Come back to this post when Intel opens Tuesday up 2% and closes the week up 10% sniffing 70$ per share.

I reiterate my position:

1700 shares, 500 April 16 80$ strike calls, and 50 February 26 65$ strike calls.

Single thread:  Intel domination throughout.

Multithread:  Intel small lead for on top tier CPUs and massive lead for mid tier.

Basic DD: INTC has been beat low from being dominated in CPU market by AMD and from competition from Apple.  Finally their newest product takes the lead again (vs AMD) and in a big way.  I can see the stock rebounding back up once wall street figures out what these CPU benchmarks mean.  If you are an AMD fan, don't panic.  AMD will still keep riding all of the contract wins it has gotten.  I am also heavily invested in AMD and will keep my long positions.  Just that with INTC stock so beat down, this is a very good turning point.

Here are the necessary edits I had to include in the post that are responses to trolls, if anyone wants more info and meme defense: 

Edit because trolls:

Look at the greeks of the contract if you know how to read them. They are good for this strike price. 

It is a safe and profitable bet with the delta and vega ratings. A 10% increase in the underlying would put it past strike price and net several hundred % return on investment.

Also: because so many people say ""AMD BEat IntEl hurrdprorpdr"" ... The success of AMD in PC gaming doesnt negate Intel's success everywhere else:

INTC - Why you Should NOT hold Intel stock long term!,48,i4mgq1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i4mgq1/intc_why_you_should_not_hold_intel_stock_long_term/,138,2020-08-06 11:45:38,"Alright guys so I'm one of the hosts on a YouTube channel named ""Max Tech"".  
I previously did YouTube work for the channel ""Appleinsider"" since 2016, making videos on Apple products which include Mac computers with Intel chips. 

I also grew up playing video games and building custom PCs right when AMD started to release six-core and 8-core processors that were cheaper than Intel CPUs and targeted towards gamers.  

Even though the Intel chips were better for gaming, I still bought AMD because they were cheaper. Intel maintained the lead for many years since games really only used 4 cores, and Intel chips gave more consistent frame rates for gaming.

At one point, it was clear to me and to everyone else that Intel was intentionally holding off from innovating and improving their performance because they already owned a bulk of the market share. They realized that they could make more profit by making small improvements every year, while AMD was busting their ass trying to figure out how they can compete. (it was ultimately the gaming and custom PC market) 

Meanwhile.. Apple was using Intel chips quite successfully in their Mac computers the like MacBooks and iMacs. And Apple was also using their XEON chips for their higher-end machines. And of course, Intel was killing it in the server market.

Now in 2013, Intel announced that they were working on their new 10nm chip process and that it should be ready to launch in 2015, and they said their 7nm chips should launch in 2017. 

Back to Intel, over the new few years, Intel delayed 10nm to 2016... and then to 2017.. and then to late 2019... We are now in 2020 and Intel is still shipping 14+++++ nm chips for high-end machines like the 2020 5K Apple iMac that was just released yesterday. Only laptops are getting the actual 10nm chips right now. 

In 2017, AMD shocked the world by announcing their new Ryzen chips, and then also their Threadripper chips, and ever since then, they've been quickly catching up to Intel in terms of both performance and price. 

Because of this, Intel instantly started lowering the price of their chips, and in 2018, they finally made 6-core chips for the MacBook Pro. 8-core chips in 2019, and now 10-core chips in 2020. This is an obvious and desperate move to try and compete with AMD. 

Because Intel's 10nm chips were not ready in 2015 or 2016, Apple's redesigned 2016 MacBook Pro which was thinner than ever before, had overheating issues. The overheating was severe in 2018 with the 6-core chips that Intel made in fear of AMD. 

There were even leaked emails from Intel executives worried about AMD's price to performance beating out Intel. 

And right now, it is well known that AMD is making BETTER price-to-performance x86 chips. 

The MOST important part of this discussion is that the tech community as a whole, including or YouTube and Reddit, are now convinced that AMD is the way to go. I've seen countless comments on my videos that are dissing on Intel chips and wishing that Apple would switch to using Intel. 

If we make a build guide video using an Intel processor, we get shamed and called dumb for not using an AMD chip. Our Mac Pro videos got a ton of negative feedback because Apple is stupid for using Intel chips. Our 2020 MacBook Pro videos were getting comments dissing on Intel's 10th-gen chips. The entire community is starting to hate Intel and preferring AMD.  

AMD stock has increased over 11x since they announced the first Ryzen chips in August of 2016.  
Intel stock has only increased 38% since that same date. 

And looking towards the future.. Intel has recently delayed their 7nm chips until late 2022 or 2023. This caused their stock price to tank at they last earnings call. 

There's even now a class-action lawsuit against Intel because of this delay. 

This also caused their chief of chip engineering to resign, and they reorganized their entire chip team. 

They've even discussed outsourcing their future 6nm, 5nm and 3nm chip production to their rival foundry TSMC because they've lost confidence in their own foundry. 

So it's clear that Intel is getting killed by AMD with each passing year, and the tech community knows it. (Which is VERY important)   


This brings us into the Apple and TSMC portion of this DD.   


Back in 2013, Apple announced their A7 chip for their iPhone 5s, the first 64 bit smartphone chip, and ever since then, there was a massive performance war between Apple and Qualcomm, fighting to create the fastest smartphone chips, in which Apple ultimately won. 

(The A13 in the iPhone 11 Pro is still much faster than the Snapdragon 865+ which was just recently released this year) 

Stuck in the middle of this battle was TSMC, which has been the EXCLUSIVE manufacturer of Apple Silicon chips for their iPhones and iPads since the A10 chip in 2016. 

And in 2018, Apple released their 11"" iPad Pro with the A12X chip manufactured by TSMC's 7nm process. This iPad from 2 years ago is so powerful that it still outperforms the new 2020 13"" MacBook Pro with Intel's 10th gen chip in both processor AND graphics performance. 

Now, Apple is about to announce their iPhone 12 in about a month that's gonna pack the A14 chip which is being built on TSMC's brand new 5nm process. 

And of course, the next iPad Pro will get a much improved A14X 5nm chip, and it's the same story for the Apple Silicon Mac chips that will start being released later this year in October/November. 

I'm of course, talking about Apple finally ditching Intel and moving forward with their own chips. This makes sense for Apple for various different reasons.

1: They can run iPhone & iPad apps on their Macs.

2: They control both the software and hardware for incredibly amounts of performance optimization.

3: They can make sure every new Mac update gets a new chip with performance improvements instead of relying on Intel to release improved chips. 

4: This is of course, much cheaper for Apple since they don't have to pay Intel the high price of their chips. 

5: They don't have to deal with overheating issues since most Intel chips are still on 14nm technology, therefore running very hot and using a lot of power.   


And there's a good chance that the very first Apple Silicon Mac chips are gonna outperform the current Intel chips, stay much cooler and give you much better battery life. 

Just to give you some perspective in terms of how Intel's 10nm compares to TSMC's 5nm..

Intel 10nm transistor density: around 100 million transistors per square millimeter.

TSMC 5nm transistor density: around 171 million transistors per square millimeter. 

  
TSMC has already confirmed that they're working on risk production of their new 3nm process in 2021,  with those chips going into 2022 iPhones, iPads and Macs. 

So here's what the future looks like:

  
Intel 7nm in late 2022/2023 : 240 million transistors per square millimeter

TSMC 3nm shipping in 2022 Apple products: 290 million transistors per square millimeter

And apparently, TSMC is already working on plans for their 2nm process for 2024.   


And due to Intel's past, there's a very good chance that Intel could delay 7nm even further, especially since they had to restructure their entire chip team, while TSMC has been on point.   


So the future isn't looking very bright for Intel's chip technology compared to TSMC. No wonder why they wanted to outsource their chips from them.   


And one last bit on Apple's switch to their own chips built by TSMC. 

Apple has already given developers their transition kit which is a Mac Mini with an A12Z chip from their iPad Pro. 

One developer tweeted this: ""At this point, I think that the first gen Apple Silicon machines will be faster at running x86 code than an actual x86...""  


What he means is that Apple's new Rosetta 2 emulation software is so good that he thinks it'll outperform Intel chips even though it's not running natively for ARM. 

So basically, Apple made the right choice by ditching Intel.   


And if Apple proves everyone wrong by coming out with incredibly great Macs thanks to their switch to their own Apple Silicon ARM-based chips, then there's a VERY good chance that the rest of the market will follow them and start developing ARM-based chips for laptops.

This will force Windows to start heavily investing in their ARM-based Windows software. 

And if you didn't already know.. Intel is FAR behind in the ARM-based chip world.   


Now, the most common argument I hear is this: Apple is only a tiny part of Intel's business, and while that may be true.. the MOST important thing is the public's view of Intel.  


The tech community is already starting to despise Intel as a brand name because of their overpriced processors and the fact that AMD is beginning to CRUSH them. 

Just wait until Apple Silicon Macs start getting released and people realize that ARM-chips have a ton of potential, and they'll start hating Intel even more. 

This will cause Intel's brand recognition and reputation to get absolutely destroyed in favor of AMD and Apple Silicon. This alone will lead to less market share. And what will happen if Nvidia or Apple buy out ARM? 

And by the way, there are now more and more ARM-based servers popping up, so there's a good chance that Intel will start to lose market share on the server side if ARM-based servers prove themselves. (They use less power so this makes sense for server farms)

&#x200B;

Basically, what I'm trying to say is that Intel just got ditched by Apple.. and they're getting killed by AMD and TSMC. ARM is coming VERY quickly and Intel is NOT ready. They have been plagued with delay after delay, and all of this drama will ruin the confidence of their staff, leading to lowered productivity. It's not looking good for Intel for the long-term.  


As of right now, Intel stock is very cheap, and you might make a few bucks if you trade short term.. but I wouldn't hold Intel stock long term.

Before Covid supply chain was running smooth as a glove, think of it as a highway full of cars flowing at exact same speed and spaced equally. This supply chain was being perfected for over a decade. And then this shitstorm happened. The highway is clogged, ships are standing loaded with crap they cannot effectively unload quick enough, there aren\`t enough ships to move products that are needed. Including basic materials for industries and intermediate components to make a final product.

For those who don\`t know, there is an absolute chip shortage in the market right now. Spanning from AMD/NVDA CPUs and GPUs, to auto chips, to new consoles, and any kind of electronics. Even AAPL will have sales issues this quarter caused by the chip shortage.

The main chip producer TSMC is ramping up CAPEX to $28 billion, including $12 bn for their US plant.

The perfect storm is brewing for NVDA and AMD to gain enormously from this market, but in my opinion AMD will end up with upper hand, let me explain.

&#x200B;

1. Back in 2017/2018 year old GPUs were selling over on Amazon and elsewhere for double their MSRP. These were old graphic cards! their price should have depreciated over time, but didn\`t. Why? Cause of B T C. Miners were buying that shit by bulks. Guess what? We\`re at the exact same situation right now, except that price of that thingy is now $50k! and with new cards being more cost effective you wouldn\`t be able to buy ANY right now even if you wanted it to simply upgrade your PC and play something. As a matter of fact try to buy GTX 10xx or RTX 20xx gen on Amazon, there are NONE! So its not only the latest gen that\`s unavailable, its ALL of them. And CPUs have the exact same problem, which wasn\`t so bad in 2018. And soon you might find it impossible to buy even any laptop having latest chip: [https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/chinese-gpu-miners-reportedly-bulk-buying-nvidia-laptops-to-mine-ether-9787156](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/chinese-gpu-miners-reportedly-bulk-buying-nvidia-laptops-to-mine-ether-9787156)
2. Not long ago NVDA announced $40 bn acquisition of ARM which would ensure they have access to state of the art IP which would make them future chip behemoth, and not surprisingly the largest companies in the world are now lobbying against that [https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22280262/qualcomm-microsoft-google-nvidia-arm-acquisition-investigations-concerns](https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22280262/qualcomm-microsoft-google-nvidia-arm-acquisition-investigations-concerns) . With this in mind, its becoming increasingly likely the acquisition wont go through. On the other hand, AMD replied with the acquisition of XLNX which seems wouldn\`t be such an issue considering AMD is way smaller than NVDA or INTC.
3. AMD and QCOM are actively lobbying US gov to address the issue, which they will. What to expect? Quite likely to remove previous trade policies regarding chips - resulting in easier access and higher/cheaper volume of chips being produced overseas. Which would mean AMD can ramp up production and meet the huge current demand of data centers and whoever needs their GPU. [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-11/biden-team-pledges-aggressive-steps-to-address-chip-shortage](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-11/biden-team-pledges-aggressive-steps-to-address-chip-shortage) . 
4. Price action - stocks follow certain pattern. They kinda wobble within some range for long period of time, 6-18 months, this is where a lot of accumulation by big players happen, and fundamentals kind of crystalize. Once the conditions are right, the stock can shoot 50% in a span of a month and then hover on new level for considerable time. Look at the chart of TSLA 2015-2019, NVDA numerous times, AMZN, GOOG, etc. Right now, NVDA is up already 20% in the last month. I believe the market will look from NVDA to AMD very soon, given points 2-3 and major holders wont be willing to sell for current price.

To recap what is the perfect storm. In 2017/18 chip shortage was caused mainly by A. the thing we dont mention here, right now its also B. new consoles cant be produced fast enough, C. supply chain issues which might be resolved soon, C. simply way bigger improvement in new CPUs/GPUs hence new upgrade cycle coupled with corporate upgrade cycle due to COVID

I believe $INTC (Intel) will be the greatest value play in this year. Fair value should be $200 per share.,57,lslau3,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lslau3/i_believe_intc_intel_will_be_the_greatest_value/,97,2021-02-26 05:59:36,"Tired of missing the boat on meme stocks? This is a real solid play with very limited downside, and unlimited upside.

DD: I believe $INTC (Intel) will be the greatest value play in this year.

Key points:

* Extremely undervalued P/E ratio of only 12.37x
* Industry competitors P/E ratio AMD: 40.88x
* Industry competitor 2 P/E ratio NVDA:  79.67x
* Fair evaluation of P/E means to match AMD's PE ratio INTC should be sitting around $200/share.
* Although Intel has missed its progression on nm competition vs AMD and NVDA, Intel is entering the GPU market and also remains one of the largest market caps in the industry.
* Biden recently formally requested a supply chain review to become more independent from Chinese suppliers for the semiconductor industry, which both AMD and NVDA heavily rely on, but INTC is producing everything in house.

Current assessment of INTC is all bearish, which means you can get the stock at a heavy discount. INTC won't stay behind forever as nm tech progression isn't linear, it becomes harder and harder to progress to the next nm phase, and INTC owning its own supply chain is a significant industry advantage.
Although AMD and NVDA is currently ahead in the nm processes, they do not own their own proprietary chips or processes, while INTC does. This puts INTC at a huge strategic advantage to boost up the US supply chain for chip supply, in the future for both CPU AND GPU. NOT just CPU. If INTC becomes fairly valued at industry PE ratios of their competitors of even just AMD, then fair value INTC stock price should hit near $200 per share levels. Currently INTC sits at around ~$60/share. Intel entering the GPU market will add significant value for the stock in addition to its strong internal supply chain in the US.

Broadcom received the wafers back from Intel last month. After its engineers and executives studied the results, the company concluded the manufacturing process is not yet viable to move to high-volume production.

AMD's new chips will be a bit better irrespective of price, and will be twice as good per dollar.

If I got something wrong in the table above, tell me so I can cover my short. I also made stats for INTC's new GPU, but it didn't look as good, so I left them off.

NVDA's high price/sales is justified by their huge margins -- 48% -- which they only have because competition has been non-existent. But that won't last, because they don't have a monopoly, TSMC has the monopoly. It isn't rocket science to run ML models on other GPUs, just nobody does because all non-NVDA chips suck (besides TPUs but GOOG is hoarding those because they didn't make enough of them). But anyone else can send TSMC a reasonable design and get their good GPU chip made, and AMD is finally going to do that. I don't know if it will help AMD, they seem richly valued themselves, but AMD over the decades, periodically sprung ahead in having the best offering in the CPU market over INTC and killed INTC's margins and crashed INTC's share price. AMD is about to do that to NVDA in GPUs.

Also I hear NVDA engineers have gone soft now they are all rich."

There has been a noticeable amount of INTC posts but non of these delve into their technical shortfalls compared to their competitors AMD NVDA TSM ARM etc

I wrote this many years ago https://old.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/9v1n6f/amazon_web_services_aws_pricing_amd_vs_intel/e994dka/

and the gap in technology is even bigger in AMD's favor.  Since 2016 I've been super bullish on AMD at $1.80, cloud computing stocks MSFT AMZN, energy stocks like TSLA etc. 

If you've ever been in a datacenter it consumes a ton of energy and why I think the future of computing is AMD NVDA TSM ARM MSFT AMZN  and energy efficiency stocks.  

INTC lacks this and is falling way behind in tech and design, still far behind and I literally called it years ago almost on the dot.   

Other users have noticed this too

https://old.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/qkihov/intc_cluster_buy_by_510_directors_and_ceo/hiwxuit/

My post pointing out that since 2016 AMD NVDA TSM have been superior in design efficiency and stock price was promptly deleted on that sub.  I reminded them that since 2016 AMD price has increased close to 6800%, NVDA 3400%, TSM 500%, cloud computing has taken off and MSFT is up 600% AMZN 500%.

Intel is gone up maybe 30% in the biggest stock run and semiconductor/cloud computing run in 5-6 years.  Abysmal compared to every semi stock.

So be weary of INTC suggestions.  Not saying you can't make money it is up 30% in 5-6 years but there are way better investments and the opportunity costs of missing out better tech like AMD NVDA TSM MSFT AMZN etc."

I‚Äôm not ludicrously experienced with options, but I can recognize some bullshit when I see it. This arcticle [(Intel ‚ÄòStunning Failure‚Äô Heralds End of an Era for U.S. Chip Sector)](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-stunning-failure-heralds-end-030711424.html) and a bunch of other üåàüêª news caused $INTC to drop off the face of the earth last week. 


I kinda fail to see the drama. Intel has always outsourced it's chips. Maybe it's doing it more now, but even 8 years ago when my brother and I built our first PC's. His chip was from Mexico, mine was from Taiwan. 


Furthermore, TSMC, the company this article says Intel should sell factories to, has been the heavyweight chip maker for a decade or more.


Nvidia and AMD for example, they are the two graphics card manufacturers. BOTH of them have their chips made by TSMC. These companies do all their designing, but in the end everything is made by TSMC anyway. At least, a lions share of it.


Now, Intel definitely has struggled in the recent market, but that's because they've demolished AMD in the performance ~~chip~~ processor market for nearly two decades. There was no reason to keep pushing their envelope, spending billions on R&D for a better product. All they had to do was refine their Lake series processors and they'd continue to rake in a ton of profit. This profit was used to expand their market to the mobile industry. Particularly laptops. For a long time it was hard to get an Apple product with any kind of processor that wasn't Intel.


They're not going away. They're not crashing.


They're just finally seeing AMD pass them in one market. This has caused other markets to start to shift due to uncertainty about who the ""best"" chip manufacturer is, but trust me - **we will see Intel back with a fiery vengeance**. Whether that‚Äôs two months from now, or two years from now, INTC is gonna come back.


I wouldn't be surprised if Intel pops out some high core count chips that are pushing 5.0-5.5 all core clock count speeds. And then once they scale down their transistor size... Oof. It's going to be a Rottweiler back in the pit. Bears r fuk.



TL;DR INTC $55c 09/18, but load up on whatever the hell you want, these contracts are CHEAP. Buy shares. Buy long calls. Do all the things because there‚Äôs literally no way to go tits up.

"INTC: The best move for next week. An incredible, short term opportunity in a high expected value underdog play. üöÄüöÄüöÄ",58,lo1fvz,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lo1fvz/intc_the_best_move_for_next_week_an_incredible/,78,2021-02-20 12:20:14,"TLDR: INTC options are much cheaper and have a higher ROI than competitors options. Intel is experiencing a stronger price action of late relative to competitors and IV in INTC should be higher than is currently priced.

Last week I exposed my view that Intel is an undervalued company and a very attractive short/medium/long term investment. In the interest of brevity I will not reiterate those points (go to my profile if you wish to read my thesis).

Today I simply want to point out a somewhat hidden but obvious attribute of INTC's short term option play.  **üöÄ**

&#x200B;

INTC options 65$ strike expiring February 26th (1 week of gametime) are the move. The main reason for the 65$ strike is that the volume and open interest is high so transacting these contracts is easy and the  ask/bid gap is very small (in this case .37/.36) **üöÄ**

&#x200B;

Last price for this option contract was at .36$ \* (100) = 36$ per option contract

As of market close and after hours INTC shares are trading at 63.06$  or 3.08% way from being in the money. Given the current hype in the semiconductor industry (justified and for more than one reason), and given Intel's market performance of late in combination with the several catalysts, (which I outlined in my previous post) I find ""beating"" this option contract a more than 50% probability.

To illustrate the absolute value of INTC relative to its competitors I will take a target price of 67$ by Friday (2$ in the money) and my current position of 50 contracts.

For every dollar above 65$ my contracts are worth 5k$ so at 67$ they would be worth 10k$. Assuming Monday you are able to buy at its last sold price of 36$ per option contract it would cost you 36\*50= 1800$. The ROI for this hypothetical play would be 555% (10,000/1,800) . To reach 67$ from the current price it would require a 6.24% increase in INTC stock price.

Reiterating, 3.08% up to be in the money and 6.24% up for ROI of 555%.

Now I would like to show you the price/return potential for other companies in the space.

Fan favorite AMD closed trading at 89.48$ per share. Applying the same parameters to AMD a 3.08% increase in AMDs stock next week would bring it to 92.25$. Options for 92$ closed last price at 78$ per contract and options at 92.5 at 63$, average them both to get a fair value for what an option price at 92.25$ would be and it comes to 70$ per option contract. This makes AMD weekly options 94.4% more expensive than INTCs. To get 50 of these it would cost you 3500$ and to finalize the comparison an increase of 6.24% would bring AMD to 95$. Assuming you could get the hypothetical 92.25$ contracts you would have 13750$ and an ROI of 393%. **üöÄ**

&#x200B;

Sparing you from going through the same process with the other examples I will just summarize (feel free to check and correct my math).

Micron: 3.08% upward move contracts < 90$ (they would be more expensive I am using 95 strike but its actually lower 94.4 to be precise) with an ROI at a 6.24% upwards move of 244%.

TSM: 3.08% upward move contracts last price would be at around 83$ (volume and open interest is lower so last price is more divergent than ask/bid and would likely be higher than 83$) with an ROI at a 6.24% move of 518%. Also looks attractive but the ask/bid gap is quite high and low volume/open interest.

I wont even do the example for NVDA because implied volatility is so high for these ranges the ROI example would be really low. Other semiconductor companies have the problem of having low volume as well, but I am sure there are others out there and you may even finda better deal.

&#x200B;

Now before you call me stupid I understand the reason why the INTC contracts are much cheaper than these other. The IV (Implied volatility is lower).  The premiums are lower because the contract writers don't expect as big of swings in INTC as they do others. My thesis is though that the market makers for these contracts are incorrectly modeling the IV of INTC stock lower than it should be. Much the same way they were with Micron a couple weeks ago.  **üöÄ**  **üöÄ**  **üöÄ**

&#x200B;

This week INTC closed up 1.6%, Micron was up 1.95%, AMD down 4.8%, and TSM down 3.6%. This week as we know most of the markets had a small correction. As I had expected INTC outperformed its competition as well as the broad markets. The week before this one  INTC closed up 4% and YTD INTC is up 26.2%.

Given the combination of factors surrounding the semiconductor scene and Intel specifically, I find that the implied upward volatility on INTC should be higher, and that in not too long it will increase as it has done the past few weeks (although still very low). The main reason why INTC contracts are so cheap relative to competitors in the industry is a simple question of supply and demand. These more memetic and loved stocks options are more sought after by retail and on top of the ""real"" volatility premium another demand heavy premium accrues. Intel being hated in this sub for example has kept option premiums much lower than they would be if it was a fan favorite.

Similar things happen in sports betting. A favorite with a lot of demand will often move the lines beyond the house spread and sometimes produce an edge for an underdog. Intel is the underdog of this story, and an underdog with very high expected value. You might hate Intel but this could still be the play for you (so long as you believe the semiconductor scene is bound to profit these weeks).

The Milwaukee Bucks are not favorites to win the championship this year (odds at +750). They probably wont win the championship and I don't see much value in that bet at the moment, but if someone was selling me Bucks futures at +5000 Id snag them up. This is the analogy I will use for the current Intel option market.

I am a degenerate. There is no shame in coming out as one in this sub, a family of autistic degenerates from all over the world. I like to gamble and so do you, but more than gamble I like to make money. I like to win and I do win.

I have 50, 65$ INTC contracts expiring the coming Friday, 500 contracts at 80$ strike for April 16 , as well as 1700 shares long. I believe in this play in the short term and long term.

For the short term, a long shot bet, but not nearly as much as the option writers have them.

This is deep fucking value.  **üöÄ**  **üöÄ**  **üöÄ**  **üöÄ**  **üöÄ**"

# May 9-10th: the boring drop

Due to ARM's shite guidance, NVDA as well as the rest of the semi-conductors are going to have a cool day tomorrow barring a sizeable increase in jobless claims (more jobless claims = economy doing crap, thus the Fed is more likely to cut interest rates, which Wall Street glazes themselves over). The reason? BS articles like this are being spread by the news that misattributes ARM's increase in pricing to the AI boom (of which it has no relation):

[https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/tsmc-morgan-stanley-hikes-pt-on-arm-ai-cpu-boost-3426842](https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/tsmc-morgan-stanley-hikes-pt-on-arm-ai-cpu-boost-3426842)

Normies eat this shit up and if SPY ain't peaking in the morning we're going to see a decrease or flat market at best bleeding into Friday. 

Call/Put skew further shows that traders are consolidating at $900 into the pre-pre-earnings week:

&#x200B;

[https://marketchameleon.com/Overview/NVDA/VolatilitySkew/](https://marketchameleon.com/Overview/NVDA/VolatilitySkew/)

The gist of this is that if we have really good news, NVDA could hit $920 but with poor market news could hit a bottom of $875 by this Friday.

With VIX (a measure of market volatility, which measures fear) being below 16 and hovering around 13, Market Makers are likely to feed into trends and buy dips so this is bullish in the market overall.

# May 13-17th: the slight recovery then deep decline

Heading into next week we are likely to see a recovery in price from the dip this week followed by a decline preceding earnings the following week. Why? Hedging. Wall Street as well as some retail investors are aware that the previous guidances issues were made under completely different macroeconomic expectations. 

Previously we were under the assumption that 3 rate cuts were coming whilst now only 1 possibly? The result is a drop in price akin to the previous earnings cycle but worse, given the poor earnings we've seen from fellow semiconductor manufacturers. 

The previous earnings cycle was actually positive across the board and what did we see?

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/u3j7wvaqdazc1.png?width=717&format=png&auto=webp&s=01f638b22d3b0eb198b7d9237993892b15121bd0

Roughly a $75 decline in share price during the week preceding earnings. And this was off of good news in the market. We could see the price hit sub-800 if everyone cashes out all at once in this week, if previous market behavior is anything to go off of.

Depending on CPI on Wednesday and Jobless Claims on Thursday this could be mediated but we shall see. The likely range is 845-895 based on previous volatility around earnings.

# May 20-22nd: Earnings END-GAME

Nvidia will most likely continue it's drop from the previous week but this isn't a problem for us. Why? Because we know NVDA is the shit. I mean it truly is in another league of it's own. It quite literally is the industry standard that only those on the know are aware of. Their platform is what pretty much everyone who trains AI is using and will continue to use due to how optimized it is.

We're talking about the comparison of an iPhone in 2008 to a flimsy flip phone. It's just so much more advanced that they are crushing the competition. This is why regardless of AMD, INTC, SMCI, all of their failures, NVDA will absolutely crush EPS, Revenue, and Guidance. 

[https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/what-is-nvidia-what-do-they-make-ai-artificial-intelligence-rcna140171](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/what-is-nvidia-what-do-they-make-ai-artificial-intelligence-rcna140171)

They are the backbone of all AI training models right now and as it stands, no one is even close to touching them. Thus they will destroy expectations and rebound to even higher highs than Wall Street has expectations for due to their monopoly-like control of the industry. Barring a world war or FTC intervention, there is no way this stock can go down.

What's poppin' bull gang, hope you're ready for week two of earnings! This week is jam packed with companies reporting within highly volatile sectors, the most notable being steel and airlines, so keep an eye out for those! Alongside those, we've got a handful of boomer blue-chips pulling through, as well as the Netflix, who got relegated from FAANG in favour of Nvidia. There's a lot of money to be made this week, especially with [*collateral plays*](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays), so make sure you've brushed up on those concepts if you haven't already!

#The Spreadsheet
To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T-_0-_jgomORReMCZ4S4M4ZMnJkgGYoyPfe7zXvN_cE/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table!

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Snapchat is inefficiently priced.** Since going public, $SNAP has had an average post earnings move of **17%**. At the time of writing, the options chain is pricing in a move of only **10%**. This priced move will ***shrink*** as we progress through the week since theta will decay the contracts, meaning we‚Äôll likely have a priced move closer to **8%** the day before the ER. Snapchat has ***never*** moved less than 6% post earnings since IPO, meaning that If you're gambling on this one, the odds are really in your favour. 6% minimum historical move, 17% average move, 8% priced move - The risk reward profile of this trade almost seems too good to be true. We ran this exact trade last quarter and made a huge bag, so I‚Äôm really hoping we get to abuse this free money glitch again come Thursday. 

&nbsp;

- **Netflix is inefficiently priced.** Same deal as $SNAP, just not as good. Netflix usually moves 8%, but options are only pricing in 5%. I don‚Äôt like this play as much as $SNAP since a straddle will run you over three grand, and that‚Äôs not exactly gambling money. Regardless, those with huge accounts and even bigger balls may opt to run this trade.

&nbsp;

- **Airline stocks aren‚Äôt priced properly (yet).** Delta Airlines tanked 5% post ER last week, resulting in the rest of the airlines also tanking 5%. $DAL closed the week down 6%, while the rest of the airlines recovered, ultimately closing out the week flat / slightly negative. This indicates to me that airlines aren‚Äôt priced properly at all - Delta had an amazing ER and put out some banger numbers, but tanked despite that due to the concerns in rising fuel prices. Rising fuel prices will end up plaguing ***all airlines***, not just $DAL exclusively, meaning that unless the airlines put up mind-blowing numbers (which are also better than the insane numbers $DAL put up), **a downward move is likely imminent.** I‚Äôm genuinely shocked that the other airline stocks recovered throughout the week despite the headwinds they‚Äôll all inevitably face during their ERs this week. Keep in mind, this analysis is made void if airlines slip throughout the week going into earnings as market re-prices them. I could be entirely wrong about this move - we‚Äôve seen time and time again that the market is extremely irrational.

&nbsp;

- **Collateral Plays are your friend!** As displayed by the airlines last week (and hopefully later this week), stocks within the same sector tend to move together. If we‚Äôre bullish or bearish on airlines, we can look to long or short $JETS, as almost all of its holding report earnings this week. The IV on $JETS is half that of the reporting tickers, meaning we‚Äôll get huge gains on a relatively small move. Most of the steel sector also reports this week! We can look to long or short the entirety of steel earnings by playing $X or $MT since we‚Äôll see a comparable move in those tickers as well, but won‚Äôt get IV crushed. More information on these types of plays can be found [here.](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays)

#Summary and Conclusion

We've got ourselves an awesome week of earnings this time round! There's many trades that have a great risk-reward ratio on them this week, which is extremely odd considering that playing earnings is usually a crapshoot. Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T-_0-_jgomORReMCZ4S4M4ZMnJkgGYoyPfe7zXvN_cE/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people find the sheet useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment, it would mean a lot to me! If you want access to more trading tools, have any specific questions or observations you‚Äôd like to share with the community, feel free to check out the community links in the spreadsheet. **Happy Trading! :)**"
INTC is actually a pretty good deal,77,i45ao7,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i45ao7/intc_is_actually_a_pretty_good_deal/,77,2020-08-05 18:55:33,"Alright fags, we've all been reading the endless DD posts the past few days.

Much like you however, I can barely read or process anything more than my basic motor functions.

For this reason, I'd like to point out in simple terms that:

INTC still has dominant market share in both consumer and server markets, this won't go away that quickly. It has a massively better cash position, revenue, and growth in key areas of its sector.

I don't give a shit about you fukin nerds obsessing over AMD Ryzen this, AMD Zen 2 that. Of course there's an architecture and technology lead. And Intel is getting smacked currently, we all know this.

Don't FOMO yourself into oblivion.

A good combination of capital and leadership can change the space (relatively) quickly, as it has many times in the past (64-bit and dual-core race in 2006)"
Get the fuck out of Intel and get out immediately.,1878,hbr1ol,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hbr1ol/get_the_fuck_out_of_intel_and_get_out_immediately/,594,2020-06-19 06:34:22,"https://www.anandtech.com/show/15846/jim-keller-resigns-from-intel-effective-immediately

Goddammit, this reminded me why I never take vacations. I've had limited access to the Internet and I was catching up on my news feeds. Apparently Jim Keller resigned from Intel one week ago, effectively immediately.

I know a lot of you here suck Lisa Su's dick nonstop because you think she was the captain that turned around AMD, and while she does deserve a lot of credit, I have argued on this very subreddit that if it had not been for her bringing back Jim Keller, AMD's unparalleled comeback would not have been possible (I also think the reason Intel is putting out press releases about shifting away from benchmarks is because they know that Zen 3 this fall will utter destroy their lineup - they will be faster in literally every single category of benchmark, not just multicore performance).

Jim Keller is well-known in the CPU industry as a legendary chip designer. He designed chips for DEC (Digital Equipment Corp), Apple (A4 / A5), AMD (K6, K8, Ryzen, etc.), Tesla's Autopilot hardware, and others.

The official press release was ""for personal reasons"". That often translates to health-related issues. I don't buy it. His brother-in-law is Jordan Peterson (yes, that Dr. Peterson), but Jordan's on the mend and recovering from his benzo addiction. Keller himself is healthy as a fucking horse. I think this is related far more to Intel and the managerial clusterfuck that the company has become over the past decade and a half. I think Keller realized he can't do what he did at AMD, which was really shake things the fuck up in order to put together the best possible team for engineering a new line of CPUs.

Why do I think this? Various reasons, listed below.

Charlie Demerjian of SemiAccurate has long detailed Intel's problems with their 10nm process, along with their management issues. Glassdoor.com has dozens of company reviews from employees of Intel where they talk about blue badge vs. green badge employees (blue badges are full-time employees that are directly employed by Intel; green badges are contractors which far less benefits). You can Google search these terms - ""Intel blue badge green badge"" and read literally page after page of material about how utterly dysfunctional Intel currently is, due to idiotic management practices. Some of the stories are laughably sad.

Intel as a company has a culture of arrogance. How could they not? They've never had a serious competitor in the x86 space, and while they missed the boat on mobile processors for smartphones and tablets - even after Steve Jobs personally approached them and told them to fix their power management issues and improve their power consumption because he wanted to use Intel x86 chips in iPads and MacBook Air lines - they didn't really care because their desktop and server market was so entrenched and they were so dominant that they figured they could live without those markets.

Well now AMD is fucking destroying them on all fronts. Desktop? Yes. Zen 2 is more power efficient than Intel's most recent desktop parts, by far, and approaches almost the exact same performance. Server? LOL, don't even making me fucking laugh... Intel's highest-end server chips are drawing almost half a fucking kilowatt for a 56 core chip. Epyc is pulling 261 watts under load for 64 cores. Laptops? AMD is ahead there now as well, with the Ryzen 4700U chip pulling **half** fucking ***HALF*** of the wattage of its competing Intel chip.

If you're a bagholding üåàüêª you better watch the fuck out because Intel is going to go nowhere but downhill from here. Its clear that their 10nm process is a steaming pile of hot garbage, with absolutely atrocious yields. You don't believe that? Ask yourself why they haven't shifted production of all chips away from 14nm++++ (however many fucking pluses they've added since 2014) and to 10nm? Ask yourself why only a handful of parts are currently 10nm, and why all those parts are either low-power laptop chips or high-power server CPUs? Simple. Low-power laptop chips are small and there's less chance of shit being fucked up during lithography. Server chips are huge and expensive, because Intel puts all 28 cores on a single chip, instead of ""gluing together"" the chips like AMD does. So out of a single wafer, they may get 300 chips. But with yields so low (in 2018, Intel's 10nm yield was than than 10%, most industry insiders don't think they've even cracked 50% yield yet), they're lucky to get 150 functional chips out of that wafer, and if you believe sites like SemiAccurate, it could be far... **far** lower. Out of those, you have to put 2 of these 28 core chips together to get Intel's high-end Platinum 9200 series CPU, which sells for $10,000 (and which practically no one is buying). AMD has 93.5% yield on Zen 2 process. That means out of a potential 840 chips, 785 of those chips are fully functional. If AMD wants a 32 core chip, they just glue together 4 of them. Problem solved. Congratulations on your 32 core server CPU.

Wait for AMD's Zen 3 launch this fall. If you're bold, short the shit out of Intel. If you're risk adverse, buy AMD and hold. Abandon ship on INTC. This fucker is going to crash and burn until at least 2023 (on average it takes 5 years to create a completely new CPU architecture, Intel hasn't done that since the Core series, which was 10 years ago, and when Keller was brought on in 2018, that's what everyone thought he would do).

First time caller long time listener.


I will keep this short.

Worlds best CPU design - Intc
Worlds largest graphics manufacturer - Intc
Worlds best embedded FPGA - Intc
Worlds most RnD spend(in field) - Yes Intc. 
Also a slew of other capabilities such as AI, navigation etc which are typically in leadership positions or close to them.

NVDa (love their products) combines best graphics and now processors


Why intel? No fear for a monopolistic view now that Amd and Nvidia have the same capabilities.

Intel ($INTC) is a terrible fucking company,169,acdgyq,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/acdgyq/intel_intc_is_a_terrible_fucking_company/,73,2019-01-04 08:06:37,"Dear Faggots,

&#x200B;

*I've thought about making a video on this for awhile but it wouldn't get shit for views so fuck that, my time is much better spent on watching YouTube and looking at you spergs lose money. Though if there's enough interest I might make a video. Plus I'm 17 and I like smoking weed and chasing girls and don't want to put up with Google's shit algorithm.*

&#x200B;

So my due diligence on Intel is extensive. It boils down to the fact that they have several key industries that generate them revenue, and they are complete shit (or are about to be shit) in all of them. These sub-industries, or whatever the hell you want to call them are (at least how I view them): **x86 chips** (their CPUs), **wireless chipset** tech, and other **weird bullshit** (Optane Memory, Intel NUCs, future R&D projects). 

&#x200B;

The main reason, and coincidentally, their main source of revenue (their processors), is because they suck at doing die-shrinks. Seriously, they've been trying to put out a 10nm chip for the past 4 fucking years now, AND THEY STILL HAVEN'T DONE IT. Meanwhile, **AMD is releasing fucking 7nm next processor cycle, and $INTC is still on their bullshit 14nm++++**. Intel has missed their roadmap year after year after year. So Su Bae is gonna kick their lazy asses in terms of performance and power consumption, and price-point as well since Intel thinks they're God's gift and have a huge premium versus a (mostly) equivalent AMD CPU. And this will take effect in the consumer PC market as well as the enterprise hardware, so like servers and shit. 

Speaking of servers, Intel's line of server/workstation CPUs (called Xeon) are complete and utter garbage pricing wise. They did this moronic rebrand where they now use cute little names like Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum to denote the tier of the latest Xeon lineup, Xeon Scalable. Now, Intel is boasting about how Xeon Scalable has sold so well, it's so much better than AMD's server chips, yada yada bunch of bullshit. Legitimately the only reason it's generated so much revenue is because of the fact that this upgrade is basically fucking required 'cause of a socket change (which is bigger than your mom by the way [https://imgur.com/a/NCeJtr2](https://imgur.com/a/NCeJtr2)) and the fact that Intel basically extorted OEMs into using it. And even then the fuckers couldn't keep them in stock, and OEMS fucking recommended AMD Epyc CPUs instead. Good shit Shittel. I'm getting sidetracked, just know that the new generation of AMD's server CPU is gonna fuck Intel in the ass, especially since OEMs are pissed off due to Intel fucking them over and them generally just being pretentious douchebags. 

So then we got the consumer-level shit. And here again AMD is gonna win, what with their higher-core counts and lower prices. Desktops for business and gaming, you name it. Power consumption becomes a much bigger deal for laptops, 2 in 1s, tablets, and 7nm is FAR superior to 14nm (and 10nm if Intel pulls off a goddamn miracle). Better battery life, thinner devices, all of this shit is gonna be powered by AMD chips... but here is a key point, on the higher end of mobile PCs. Here's the other reason why Intel is fucked with their mobile chips: ARM is actually really goddamn good now. ARM-based chips have already been put into Windows devices, and they have really good battery life, but performance always lacks compared to Intel chips. But with the new ARM generations coming out, they can compete with the low-end Intel chips (Like i3s) and the mid-tier ones (i5s), whilst having like 3 times the battery life. Jesus. For instance, a Qualcomm Snapdragon based laptop, and this is the current gen which mind you will be improved with ARM's upcoming 7nm and 5nm die shrinks, gets fucking 22 hours of battery life! Holy shit. And that's just Windows. I personally think Apple is kind of a shit company even though I love my MacBook Pro, but by god they make the best ARM chips. Legit the fucking processor in the iPhone X (a year old phone) is way better than the chips made by Samsung in any Android phone. And the iPhone XS and new iPad Pro? Good god the A12 and A12X are absolute monsters [http://browser.geekbench.com/mobile-benchmarks](http://browser.geekbench.com/mobile-benchmarks). So why the fuck does this relate to Intel? Because Apple is going to make their new MacBook Airs, MacBooks, and lower end MacBook Pros with their in-house ARM chips. And the higher end MacBooks? Well fuck it they'll be on AMD silicon. This is gonna further eat away at Intels precious market share.

&#x200B;

Ok so now we move on to Intel's dogshit wireless tech. **Intel is absolutely FUCKED for 5G**. Whilst Qualcomm already has a working 5G modem that can fit in a smartphone, Intel hasn't progressed beyond a giant fucking box filled with FPGAs. And 5G won't come immediately, and Qualcomm still has a bunch of work left to do, I think it's safe to say Intel is at least a year behind Qualcomm. Also Intel's current gen modems suck dick and Apple only uses them because of the bitchfit they threw about Qualcomm's pricing model which is gonna continue for the foreseeable future (Long Qualcomm $QCOM?) .

&#x200B;

So finally we get into the **other bullshit** Intel makes. I don't really give a fuck about it to be honest, it makes up pretty **little of their actual revenue**. They have really overpriced SSDs called Optane that nobody uses because its stupid and like 5x what Samsung's flash is priced at. They also have like the NUC, New Unit of Computing, which is like a Windows Mac Mini that doesn't suck, but who cares. And lastly, I'm gonna mention that Intel is going to attempt to try and make GPUs to compete with the likes of Nvidia and AMD, but they're gonna suck and be overpriced because Intel doesn't know how to make GPUs and they legit tried the exact same thing in 2009 and it completely flopped. 

&#x200B;

I'm done. Hopefully y'all made it this far. Good on you if you did. Make some tendies off this shit.

They‚Äôre planning to shift their entire bread-and-butter future Server and Client products to TSMC 7nm and beyond, combining the best of both worlds.  Their own fabs will be focused on 10nm production, where most of their volumes are.  They are already finalizing architectual and design porting to TSMC process.

Bull case for INTC,42,ipx2lm,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ipx2lm/bull_case_for_intc/,72,2020-09-10 10:42:06,"So as most of you AMD fanbois know Intel don‚Äôt got 7nm. Yes they‚Äôre behind a generation but CPU performance improved by 15-20%. But honestly I could give a shit less. 

Normies don‚Äôt look at that. Normies see the ‚Äúintel core‚Äù sticker and they‚Äôre sold. They have blind faith because they recognize the brand. To be honest if these companies weren‚Äôt something I paid attention to I probably would have never even known that AMD is ‚Äúbeating‚Äù Intel. Intel‚Äôs core customers know that and that‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt think Intel is going to lose much more market share to AMD. Maybe they‚Äôll gain the super dedicated gamers and computer enthusiasts that care about that level of performance. But I don‚Äôt think they represent the vast majority of tech consumers. The average tech consumer doesn‚Äôt give a rats ass. They know Intel so they trust Intel. 

Don‚Äôt believe me? 

Ask anyone that doesn‚Äôt trade/ is a computer enthusiast if they know who INTEL is. Then ask them who AMD is. I‚Äôm certain they‚Äôll only recognize one. 

AMD just doesn‚Äôt have the same level of brand recognition. 

The recent Tech ‚Äúcrash‚Äù dragged intel back to a PE of 9. Meanwhile AMD is chilling at around 160. I find it hard to believe that somehow even though INTC has 10 times the revenue, and retains around 30% if that into NET income (where AMD is at was most recently at a wimpy 8%) that its valued far below AMD. Big fish have been eyeing it. Vanguard bit this quarter. 

On top of that the recent acquisition of Mobileye should catch the attention of you Daddy Musk littles and NIO SIMPS (I don‚Äôt blame you for throwing your life savings at them their cars do look sexy af) As you probably don‚Äôt know the original version of TSLA autopilot ran on Mobileye. Daddy Musk got cocky and advertised the self driving system as being far more autonomous that it was which after a crash cause Mobileye to pull out of their deal with TSLA. If you ask TSLA it‚Äôs because mobileye was unhappy with TSLA taking over some aspects of production. Either way that spells a smart business because they were either avoiding lawsuits or defending their right to their technology. That doesn‚Äôt change the fact that they were Tesla‚Äôs first choice and for good reason. 

Musk is now arguing against the use of a Lidar system saying that ‚Äúanyone relying on Lidar is doomed‚Äù, but Mobileye disagrees. So does Cornell. 

https://www.google.com/amp/s/arstechnica.com/cars/2019/08/elon-musk-says-driverless-cars-dont-need-lidar-experts-arent-so-sure/%3famp=1

The gist is a camera only system is bound to fail in certain environments and also performs worse in poor lighting. Ultimately if we‚Äôre going to have fully self driving cars they‚Äôre going to need to be able to function in all types of environments including the roads of India and China which is a task that Mobileye is already successfully undertaking. 

Mobileye‚Äôs customers include Nissan, Volkswagen, Cadillac, BMW and NIO. Most of which have agreed to share driving data with Mobileye, which puts them at a massive advantage compared to TSLA. Ultimately a camera only system is bound to eventually fail and in a society that is already skeptical about the safety of autonomous cars. 


According to the degenerates that call themselves analysts INTC has at most a 9% downside if it touches the historical low PEs of 7. But it also has a potential 100% upside. AMD on the other hand could drop all the way down to $8 and still have a higher price to earnings than Intel. But as you already know the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.

Intel has been more efficient with their money, they have real brand recognition that I highly doubt AMD will ever achieve. Oh and they‚Äôre currently brining in like 10 times more tendies than AMD. They have a massive economic Moat while AMD barely has one. 

Don‚Äôt trade on emotions trade on fact. And the fact is Intel has a bigger potential upside

Intel isn‚Äôt a fast mover, at these levels it still has a potential downside because the whole sector is shaky but that will only create better buying opportunities.

ROKU pop to close up 5.44%, closing at $335 thanks to WFC analyst raising PT from $275 to $414 (yep) and keeping his overweight rating. 

* Today's big movers: FUBO was up as high as 21%, ~~M-A-R-A was up as high 23% while B-N-G-O drilled more than -30% during intraday lows after an initial halt in the early mornings.~~ FUBO closed up 12.83% to $27.35, ~~M-A-R-A closed up 23.43% to $13.59, and B-N-G-O closed down -31.25% to $4.95~~.

Meanwhile, Congress is set to confirm Biden's win over Trump, a procedural formality that generally receives little news coverage but not in the current timeline. Expect POTUS to rage over Pence on Twitter later tonight if the latter confirms Biden's Electoral College win. Look to weed and clean energy sector for pops if the Dems somehow wins both seat. No doubt many WSBer have already loaded up on FDs to showcase the sick gains porn tomorrow if the magic happens.

alrighty folks the bear market is here i hope you are all surviving or whatever. Pretty much looking to sell all rallies until proven otherwise. Going with a personal favourite of mine to short and that bad boy is intel. FA is for suckers, everyone i know uses anything but intel, good enough for me.

on to the fun stuff: TA and calculating how much you will win if you're right.

TA:

one of the cleanest weekly supports I have ever seen around 44 area here. general thoughts are that everyone who has bought 44 has never been put under pressure and for the first time we have had a little tasty poo underneath. also love the fact that there is a gap/inefficiency below and no support till like 37ish. more locally we have been in a pretty strong downtrend that appears to be gaining steam and all rallies have sold off quite hard. To me this looks like a pretty clear support/resistance flip and if confirmed should be expected to make new local lows. not exactly rocket science on the TA side here, all the better cause we're all retarded.

[https://imgur.com/a/IQS4r3o](https://imgur.com/a/IQS4r3o)

very low time frames look like a market structure break and with a decent invalidation. assuming that holds we should be able to swing it for a fresh new low and with no real support below i like 38.

[https://imgur.com/a/RrmRQJz](https://imgur.com/a/RrmRQJz)

after having squinted, cocked head, and eyeballed personal risk tolerance i have come to the grand conclusion that options are a wonderful way to express a short. knowing basically nothing of consequence about options I think that some good ol' atm puts with an expiry in two weeks seems reasonable. along with an arbitrary basket of other levered to the tits options expiring over vastly different periods of time. I'm not really a big stock guy but if this were a coin i'd be levering the fuck up on the short side.

$INTC misses earnings on Thursday and makes $AMD retrace to good support $73-77 area. Buy calls dirt cheap on Friday/Monday and we ride them through earnings and retire pimps üòé

Ideal calls: 11/6 or 11/13 $90 strike price. I wont be sure about my position until after Intel earnings. I'm hoping they dump so no entry yet for me.

Bullish Argument for $INTC,10,w8rwp9,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/w8rwp9/bullish_argument_for_intc/,28,2022-07-27 00:27:45,"Before I even start, take all this with a tiny grain of salt, I currently have \~600$ in my Robinhood, and \~500$ of it is in a long call for Intel expiring in 2024. Also took a lot of Adderall today, so I'm feeling a bit frisky w my money. So yeah, don't take this as financial advice, just my thoughts on the matter.

**Fundamentals**

As of January 2022, the industry average PE ratio for semiconductors was \~113, while $INTC has a PE ratio of 6.51. For example, $AMD has a PE ratio of 32.68, $NVDA has a PE ratio of \~45, and $TSM has a PE ratio of \~17. While all of these are great companies, I feel they are a tad bit overvalued at the moment - I could be completely wrong with this, but I think Intel is catching up in terms of technology.

Other than PE ratio, Intel has plenty of other positives on their balance sheet - they are still one of the biggest semiconductor manufacturers, they have little debt (at least according to FinViz), they have good margins etc.

**Current Policies**

Well, at least from what I understand, the political tensions between the US and China are fairly high, and I think that's really because of Taiwan. The pandemic really exposed how weak some aspects of our supply chain are, and one thing that came out of it was this global semiconductor shortage, primarily because a majority of our semiconductors come from $TSM, so the stability of semiconductor supply chains is, to a reasonable extent, dependent on the stability of $TSM and hence Taiwan.

I think this semiconductor shortage opened the door for government support of the domestic semiconductor industry, and this gave rise to the Chips Bill, in which the government is allocating billions of dollars toward domestic semiconductor manufacturing. From what I understand, this funding will most likely go towards the three major semiconductor manufacturers in the world: TSMC, Samsung, and Intel.

We all know how ""frugal"" the US government is with our tax money. In recent years, all three companies began constructing many fabs throughout the US, but both TSM and Samsung are building fabs for their current generation chips, ie. chips that will be outdated by the time these fabs are even constructed and operational. That only leaves Intel with fabs that are actually, at least according to their timeline, up to date with their technology. (source: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chips-bill-advances-in-senate-heres-whats-in-the-79-b-legislation-161413736.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chips-bill-advances-in-senate-heres-whats-in-the-79-b-legislation-161413736.html))

While the Chips act may be a major catalyst for these companies, I remember watching a video that Intel is working with other governments too, particularly the German government, in order to build more fabs and relieve the strain on the semiconductor supply chain. (source: [https://www.theregister.com/2022/06/08/intel\_germany\_tsmc/#:\~:text=The%20German%20subsidies%20for%20Intel's,the%20project%2C%20according%20to%20Kr%C3%B6ber](https://www.theregister.com/2022/06/08/intel_germany_tsmc/#:~:text=The%20German%20subsidies%20for%20Intel's,the%20project%2C%20according%20to%20Kr%C3%B6ber).)

**Recent History**

In the past decade, Intel has fallen behind its peers in the semiconductor world. Personally, I think this was because of their CEO, Bob Swan - he was into finances and cut the R&D budget for share buybacks and such, giving time to companies like AMD and TSMC to make their products more competitive, eventually overtaking INTC. I remember in July/August 2020, when Intel announced for like the fifth time they are running late, their stock plummeted. Naturally, I threw in a lot of money into calls (and subsequently lost money on all of those in the coming few months).

Sometime after that, Pat Gelsinger took over and became CEO of Intel. He is an engineer and began to push for a higher R&D budget for Intel. He has a pretty ambitious plan, but I really think he's going somewhere with it - I saw an interview with him a few months back, and he said something along the lines of ""I probably have more construction trucks working for me right now than anyone else on this planet"" in reference to the new fabs Intel is building around the world. I'm sorry I don't have references for these, I just remember seeing it on youtube a while back.

Also, another big change he announced was that Intel will begin making chips for other manufacturers, ie. Qualcomm, Amazon (source: [https://www.reuters.com/technology/intel-build-qualcomm-chips-aims-catch-foundry-rivals-by-2025-2021-07-26/](https://www.reuters.com/technology/intel-build-qualcomm-chips-aims-catch-foundry-rivals-by-2025-2021-07-26/)). I feel this has the potential to extend to much bigger companies if Intel gets it together, ie. Apple, Samsung, etc just to reduce their dependencies on TSM as their sole manufacturers.

**Final Thoughts**

The biggest argument I have for Intel is that this is the company that literally invented the CPU - Silicon Valley is literally named after Intel and its work. I do not see it failing to this relatively minor roadblock.

Another thing to note is that, yeah intel right now is behind in terms of performance to their peers, but their architecture is not in the worst shape. Like yeah in terms of nanometers, intel is not doing all that great right now, but that is not the entire story. Intel has always put more emphasis on transistor density. For example, the transistor density of Intel's 10nm chips is equivalent to that of TSM's 7nm, and the density of Intel's 7nm chips is actually greater than TSM's 5nm chips (source: [https://www.granitefirm.com/blog/us/2021/12/28/tsmc-process-roadmap/#:\~:text=Intel's%2010nm%20transistor%20is%20100.76,TSMC's%205%2F4nm%20of%20171.30](https://www.granitefirm.com/blog/us/2021/12/28/tsmc-process-roadmap/#:~:text=Intel's%2010nm%20transistor%20is%20100.76,TSMC's%205%2F4nm%20of%20171.30)) The only real advantage of smaller ones is that they are more power efficient - there is not much of a difference in performance. In general, more density equates to more transistors, and hence, better performance.

While smaller, less performance more efficient cpu's, like those of TSMC/AMD etc, might favor consumers for typical laptops and such, greater performance more power hungry cpu's, mainly INTCs CPUs, will always be required for servers. And just seeing the rate of growth in our dependency on cloud or server-based infrastructures, I feel Intel has a solid positive in the long run.

Intel has a really ambitious plan, but I really believe the company is headed in the right direction with its recent moves, especially so if more and more governments agree to fund fabs in their countries. And that's my bullish case for intel, totally let me know if any of this is wrong or if you guys have any comments and such. Thank you!"

All in on INTC and Why You Shouldn't Count Them Out,27,t01117,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/t01117/all_in_on_intc_and_why_you_shouldnt_count_them_out/,32,2022-02-24 09:21:43,"Full disclosure all the money in my and my wife's TFSA's (Tax Free Savings Account for the Canucks) is in INTC that's about $160K CAD . Here's a little history lesson for the younger crowd.

Back in the early 2000's Intel had a processor called the Pentium 4. It was such a piece of shit that the Pentium 3 it replaced was often faster than it. In fact, the Intel mantra of only the paranoid survive had them spending money to continue developing the Pentium 3 even though the Pentium 4 was the direction their marketing department wanted, i.e. MOAR MHZ. We'll get back to the pentium 3 later, but bottom line Pentium 4 was too hot, too slow and used too much power.

How did Intel go from top dog to underdog so quickly? AMD at the time had the Athlon CPU and later the Athlon XP which pretty handily beat the Pentium 4 at 80% of use cases (outside of video encode/decode). This is important because a certain rockstar engineer, Jim Keller, was responsible for a large chunk of the the Athlon and Athlon XP.

If we look at Jim Keller's resume, he worked for AMD and brought them to the forefront with Athlon. He worked for Apple and is responsible for setting the groundwork for the modern M1. He later worked for AMD again and is largely considered the engineer responsible for Ryzen, but he is too humble to admit it. He also worked for Tesla. Pretty much every single company he works for turns to gold. Who did Jim Keller work for before he funded and became the VP of his own AI startup? Intel.

CPU designs takes years and Alder lake is not completely Jim's baby, but he certainly played a part in it's development. Alder lake caught up and in several ways surpassed AMD in one CPU generation on an INFERIOR manufacturing node. That's freaking impressive. The full Jim Keller CPU is supposed to be Royal Cove which will be competing with Zen 5 possibly late next year or early 2024.

I'm not finished. Lisa Su is pretty worshipped around here, but let's look at Lisa's engineering resume. She was responsible for the Cell CPU in the PS3. A CPU so shit and so badly missed it's design goals that Sony had had to duct tape a Nvidia graphics card to it last minute. This extra cost to the already expensive PS3 and subsequent YLOD almost cost Sony their console division.

On other hand we have Pat Gelsinger that took that pentium 3 and came out with a little product called the core2duo. The core2duo later became the i7, i5 and i3 architecture when the added an on die memory controller. He also introduced the tick tock design mantra at intel which led them to over a decade of dominance. 

I'm a retard like all of you so don't put all your money in intel like me, but sure as hell don't count them out."
"Jinxed by INTC, TWICE and Still Thinking about a Third Time",51,lkkoth,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkkoth/jinxed_by_intc_twice_and_still_thinking_about_a/,42,2021-02-16 00:43:08,"Didn't qualify as a Loss post so have to post as Disussion. 

First time:

Bought INTC at around March 2020 for a price of $51 per share. Idea back then was pandemic lockdown coming, everything was shifting online, 5G just started to popularize, thought that 5G & gaming could have a go. Was thinking among TSM, NVDA and INTC and finally chose TSM and INTC as the Big 2 Battle (really should have bought NVDA!).

Watched INTC climb to around $60 then this sucker announced in July 2020 it had to delay its 7nm production. Shares slumped to $47-$48. 23% loss over one week. Took it three months to finally climb back to over $52 in October 2020. Sold my shares with minor profits plus tiny bits of dividend.

Second time:

INTC had major reshuffling across Nov.2020 to January 2021 and the new CEO talked a good game. Thought that INTC had a bit of a ""catch-up"" play ahead. Re-entered INTC at around $58 in early January 2021. Saw the price climb to $62 on Jan.20 2021. Then some hacker hacked into the company's database and exposed part of the financial data and the company was forced to release 2020 Q4 reports early (not a great report anyway, net profit dropped 15% YoY). Took another two weeks for shares to recover to $60. Sold at $59. Again negligible profits.

Yes I did earn some breadcrumbs in these two trades but overall I consider it a loss since these two big ass black swans grabbed the big piece of bread from my hand.

But three times might be a charm. I am planning to enter INTC again and see if Karma is on my side this time."

BOUGHT 5 INTC Jan21'22 40 CALL @ 8.05

&#x200B;

Intel currently about $48

&#x200B;

Intel Positive catalysts: Release of Alder lake (12th gen, Intel finally leaving 14nm that its used for 6 gens, and moving to 10nm) on Nov 4. Leaked reports, if true will be able to beat AMD at their respective price points. (Of course AMD can always just play price cuts. Additionally, AMD has already showed their new tech V Cache which can supposedly improve peformance by up to 15% over their existing 5k Ryzen series but those will come ETA 1st half 2022.) Intel is also going to release GPUs (which will probably be buggy since its the first time Intel is selling GPUs), but they \*claim\* they can fight with Nvidia's RTX 3070. 

&#x200B;

New CEO May be good for intel. He was the ex VMWARE CEO and used to be an Intel employee before. Was mentored by Intel's founder. He tripled VMWare's revenue while he was their CEO from 2012-2021. Intel is also investing heavily into R&D and making new foundries, which is in line with USA's national interest in not being overly reliant on an endangered Taiwan SMC in case China takes over it.

&#x200B;

Importantly, Intel just failed their Q3 earnings HORRIBLY (AS EXPECTED from SHITEL) and cut guidance. Their stock crashed from $56 last week to $48 today. The stock is partially beat down (though imo, i think it still could bleed out further. Will pick up more INTC if it drops more.) Expectations for this company has been reduced due to their poor performance. 

&#x200B;

Why buy these calls instead of the stock? Because there is almost no theta for these calls. $30 strike + $18.15 = $48.15 for a 2023 LEAP. And $40+$8.05 = $48.05 for a 3mths call. Stock is at $48.05 at time of posting.

&#x200B;

There is a half decent chance that Intel can do a partial AMD. AMD was a loser that made inferior cpus for 10 years. Intel has been a loser for 2 years. Even being competitive with AMD is an upgrade from being a loser.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Intel has positive catalysts in new, competitive CPUs launching on Nov 4. CEO has changed and expectations for the company are reduced, which means it's easier to surprise people."
Interest in $INTC is increasing dramatically... but why? There are no signs of a bottom yet? Or is there...,2,xg5p3w,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xg5p3w/interest_in_intc_is_increasing_dramatically_but/,25,2022-09-17 04:28:55,"$INTC has been ‚Äúdown-only‚Äù for close to 17 months now (-58%) and has yet to show any real signs of a bottom forming from a technical analysis perspective.

However, there is something of interest going on with $INTC at these incredibly low prices. üëÄüëá

Despite a bearish stock price, the social activity surrounding $INTC is increasing with sustained growth in the number of social mentions (unique mentions of $INTC), and the number of social contributors (unique people talking about $INTC).

**1-Year Social Activity for $INTC:**  
**-** Social mentions: 72.9K +50.19%  
\- Social contributors: 157 +45.37%

**What does this mean? And how can we use this information to our advantage?**

The recent rise in $INTC social activity indicates that there‚Äôs increasing interest in $INTC at these levels. And since the stock price is already down so much, we must ask ourselves‚Ä¶

**Are the people contributing to this increased interest looking to short $INTC or long $INTC?**

I‚Äôm willing to bet it's the latter.

I mean, the stock price is already incredibly low‚Ä¶ so it's logical to think that people are talking more frequently about $INTC now because they want to buy.

Anyways, I think social activity around stocks can be very telling, and it‚Äôs fun to try and decipher what the market is thinking.

**So, what do you guys think? Is the increase in $INTC social activity bullish? Or bearish?**"
