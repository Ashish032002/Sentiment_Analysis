The strike at Boeing ($BA) is just the start. The next quarterly report will be a mess. Making a small bet in the $120 strike put option,174,1ffr45y,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ffr45y/the_strike_at_boeing_ba_is_just_the_start_the/,55,2024-09-13 15:39:57,"As you know, Boeing has messed up again, and the ongoing work strike could last another 1-2 months, similar to the automotive strikes. This will likely drain Boeing‚Äôs cash flow by at least another $3 billion. Given they‚Äôre already operating with negative cash flow, any further bleed will push back their timeline to achieve positive cash flow.

Keep in mind that the upcoming quarterly report is shaping up to be another nightmare for shareholders. The additional red tape in their production process, aimed at improving quality, is only going to slow things down further, leading to more delivery delays and cost increases.

We can expect their losses to widen, cash flow to worsen, and it‚Äôs very likely the stock price will drop below $100 after the next quarterly results. So, put it is.

Boeing ($BA) Thoughts,6,1b87z69,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1b87z69/boeing_ba_thoughts/,15,2024-03-07 00:29:15,"TL;DR: Unless Boeing purchases Spirit Aerosystems, I don‚Äôt see this company turning around. And even then, it‚Äôs going to take a long time. There‚Äôs not a lot of material news on the horizon that would move this stock in a positive direction. Won‚Äôt recommend a position, but in the near term I‚Äôd expect it to either trade sideways or gradually dump - I don‚Äôt think big moves in either direction really make sense, but obviously that can all change with a single headline (which is why I don‚Äôt generally play aviation-related stocks). I‚Äôm writing this only because I keep seeing BA mentioned; my personal opinion is that this isn‚Äôt worth opening a position on given how many other better plays are out there right now.

Also keep in mind that Boeing will start negotiating with its unions this week, and the company is not in a position to negotiate from a place of power. Between this and the increased scrutiny by the FAA, well, taken together these are probably the last things BA needs right now.

______________

The rest:

It was reported this week that Boeing is reconsidering purchasing Sprit Aerosystems (any mention hereafter refers to Spirit Aerosystems, not Spirit the ultra low cost carrier). Spirit was up ~11% on the news.

Boeing is currently about 66% of Spirit‚Äôs business. The rest is Airbus and Bombardier. Critically, Spirit makes the wings for the Airbus A220 - which will probably become one of Airbus‚Äô top offerings going forward.

Also fun fact: Boeing owned what became Spirit until 2005. It was known previous as ‚ÄúBoeing Wichita.‚Äù The spin-off was a function of the Boeing/MD merger and well-documented shift from the emphasis on engineering to the MBAs/accountants in the C-suite.

______________

Boeing delivered around 500 aircraft last year (YOY increase over 2022, but still below prepandemic) while Airbus was over 800. Boeing has about 5,000 orders while Airbus has over 8,000. 

Certain bets aren‚Äôt paying off - Boeing invested a ton of time and money trying to reinvent the wheel with the mostly composite 787, and it turns out that an Airbus using traditional techniques and materials with the same engines is almost just as efficient (CFM LEAP-1). They also spent a ton of money trying to automate riveting. That failed spectacularly after years and loads of money spent, ultimately forcing them to fall back on unionized labor.

Single aisle short-haul jets (like the 737) are the bread and butter of both Airbus and Boeing, and Airbus is also out-producing Boeing almost 2:1 right now. You may have heard that the FAA has imposed a limit on how many 737s Boeing can build until they‚Äôre satisfied with Boeing‚Äôs quality control - that is true. But Boeing wasn‚Äôt even hitting that number *before* the Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 incident in January. In addition to the high profile 737 MAX crashes in 2017 and 2018, Boeing more recently discovered manufacturing defects on new MAX jets last year (again, QC issues with Spirit Aerosystems. One was poor QC that led to difficulty attaching the vertical stabilizer on the tail, and the second - discovered from that error - was mis-drilled holes on the aft pressure bulkhead IIRC). 

Boeing is struggling to get exemptions for certifying the 737 MAX 7 and MAX 10. Until Boeing can figure out the 737 MAX series and reliably deliver it to customers, they will keep bleeding.

Honestly you could stop reading here; solving the 737 issue both now and for what follows it are the primary challenges facing Boeing‚Äôs core business.

______________

But if you‚Äôre still reading:

Longer term, Boeing put its ‚ÄúNew Midsize Airliner‚Äù (NMA) program on ice in 2020 - before the pandemic. There‚Äôs talk of that program coming back online, but more pressing is developing a true successor to the 737. Slapping new wings and engines on it likely won‚Äôt be enough to comply with coming efficiency regs; Boeing has already said the 737 MAX family will be the last of the 737s (a design itself rooted in the now-ancient 707).

New engines keep getting bigger and bigger (larger diameter = higher bypass ratio = greater efficiency), and the 737 is already struggling to accommodate the CFM LEAP-1s (hence all the software and workarounds that helped contribute to the crashes in 2017/2018). The 737 was originally designed with low bypass engines (very small engine diameter) that allowed it to sit very close to the ground.

The massive 777X was originally supposed to be start being delivered in 2020. It‚Äôs 2024 and that still hasn‚Äôt happened. AFAIK, there are still zero orders for the 777X by domestic carriers. 

The 747 production line shutdown almost a decade ago. That was a huge cash cow for Boeing for decades. The 767 and 757 are also dead or dying (with the exception of a couple military programs - but we‚Äôll get to that).

______________

On the government/military side, Boeing is hemorrhaging money on fixed-price contracts. Over the past decade, I think they‚Äôve lost around $12B-14B. The only successfully managed program that comes to mind is the Navy‚Äôs P-8 Poseidon (anti-submarine variant of the 737-800).

T-7 Red Hawk jet trainer. KC-46 Pegasus (aerial refueled based on the 767). MQ-25 Stingray (unmanned carrier-based tanker for the Navy). VC-25B (‚ÄúAir Force One‚Äù). Starliner (their competitor to SpaceX Dragon). These programs have all turned into major money pits for Boeing.

They walked away from the E-4B Nightwatch (heavily modified 747 ‚Äúdoomsday‚Äù plane program, which should have been a slam dunk for them.

The MQ-28 Ghost Bat (unmanned fighter) and E-7 Wedgetail (airborne early warning aircraft) seem to be doing decent, but I think it‚Äôs too early to tell.

Boeing and Lockheed are in competition to be the prime contractors on the F-22 replacement (called ‚ÄúNext Generation Air Dominance,‚Äù or NGAD), but it‚Äôs kind of hard to see Boeing getting that contract since they‚Äôve been out of the fighter game for so long.

So when you step back and take all that together‚Ä¶it‚Äôs probably not a great picture.",0.0,2024-03-07,4

 received orders for only four new planes in May ‚Äî and for the second straight month, none for its best-selling 737 Max, as fallout continues from the blowout of a side panel on a Max during a flight in January.

The results released Tuesday compared unfavorably with Europe‚Äôs Airbus, which reported orders for 27 new planes in May 

Boeing also saw Aerolineas Argentinas cancel an order for a single Max jet, bringing its net sales for the month to three.

The dismal results followed poor figures for April, when Boeing reported seven sales ‚Äî none of them for the Max.

Boeing hopes that the slow pace of orders reflects a lull in sales before next month‚Äôs Farnborough International Airshow, where aircraft deals are often announced.

But the Federal Aviation Administration is capping Boeing‚Äôs production of 737s after a door plug blew out from an Alaska Airlines Max, allegations by whistleblowers that Boeing has taken shortcuts to produce planes more quickly, and reports of falsified inspection records on some 787 Dreamliner jets.

Boeing, based in Arlington, Virginia, delivered 24 jetliners in May, including 19 Max jets. Ireland‚Äôs Ryanair got four and Alaska Airlines took three. Airbus said it delivered 53 planes last month.

# Background
- Boeing is in the doghouse right now, reputation-wise for some insignificant shit like scaring some passengers with a minor unscheduled depressurization and maybe probably not doing a good job with the whole airplane manufacturing thing.  
- The stock market is a hyper-real simulacrum, everyone seems to be trading based on anticipating other traders' sentiment and not the underlying value of the stock (though that's nothing new)  
- Currently SpaceX is the only company operating in the space-freight business  
- The current White House hates Elon because he hates Joe Biden, but they can't do shit because they need what he's selling 
- Getting real live humans to the ISS on Starliner will prove it's ready to compete with SpaceX  
- Boeing is so far integrated into the MIC that they're basically a part of the US Gov and will therefore never be allowed to fail

# What's happening now and why does it matter? 
- [Tonight, at 10:34 EDT Boeing is going to launch the Boeing Starliner](https://www.npr.org/2024/05/06/1249243643/boeing-starliner-crewed-launch-nasa-international-space-station) atop a ULA (aka BA+LMT) Atlas V
- If it doesn't kill anyone or abort, the Starliner will be a proven spacecraft that will be capable of doing normal trips to the ISS with crew and freight
- [The current administration doesn't like Elon](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/20/white-house-slams-musk-antisemitic-post-but-says-foolish-to-drop-spacex-contracts.html) but needs SpaceX   
- The government likes working with Boeing because they're dependable, even if they're dependably over budget and past deadline  
- A successful manned launch will get people all hot and bothered, and they'll buy stock based off that sentiment  
- People will be distracted from the airplane failures, which is good for Boeing

- Buy calls if you think the rocket will make it
- Buy puts if you think Sunita Williams et al. are going to die

I know you got the last charts, the media published them perfect.

So this is my DD I'm sending you I hope you hear it I'm in a Tesla right now, dare me to drive?

You  know that song by Darude? Forgot it's name.

About that guy who could a  saved that other guy from drowning, but didn't, then Phil saw it all,  then at a a show he found him?

That's kinda how this is, you could a rescued me from drowning in debt

Now it's too late, I'm down a thousand dollars now, I'm drowsy

And all I wanted was a lousy investment or a call

I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall

I love you Elon, we could have been on Mars together, think about it, you ruined it now.

I hope you get shorted and you dream about it, and when you dream I hope you get shorted more and you scream about it.

I hope the hedgefunds eats at you and you can‚Äôt breath without GME

""BUY SILVER, BUY SILVER""

SHUT UP CNBC I'm trying to Talk

Hey Elon that's the hedge fund managers making them talk

But we didn't fuck them up yet, see I ain't like you.

Cause if they buy more shorts they'll suffer more and then they'll go bankrupt too.

Well gotta go they are taking my laptop and my car now

# EDIT: Elon's reponse:

Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy

You said your wife's pregnant by her boyfriend now, how far along is she?

Look, I'm really flattered you would buy TSLA calls like that

And here's an autograph for your Mother

I wrote it on the Tesla cap

I'm sorry I didn't see you at the annual stockholder meeting, I must have missed you

Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you

But what's this shit you said about you sold your GME when it fell too?

I say that shit just clownin' dog, come on, how fucked up is you?

You got some gambling issues Stan, I think you need some counseling

To help your ass from bouncing off the walls when your stocks get down some

And what's this shit about us being ""in this together""?

I'm a billionaire lol

I really think you and your wife need each other

Or maybe you just need to treat her boyfriend better

I hope you get to read this message, I just hope it reaches you in time

Before you sell again, I think that you'll be doin' just fine

If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but Stan

Why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do have diamond hands

I just don't want you to do some crazy shit

I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago so I bought GME in the dips

Some dude was high on PCP and drove his car to a Gamestop

And ""STONKS"" he screamed, for 24 hours outside the closed shop non-stop

And in the car they found a phone with 0 GME left, but I forgot who it belonged to

Stay Away from BA - BUY ERJ!! Embraer is the Boeing of 40 years ago,31,1bp8wh2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bp8wh2/stay_away_from_ba_buy_erj_embraer_is_the_boeing/,52,2024-03-27 23:50:34,"Boeing fucking sucks, but shorting their stock or buying puts its not smart. They just fired their shitty CEO and the stock shot up 2%. I'm sure BA will keep shooting themselves in the foot, but in the meantime they are being rewarded for very basic improvements. Stay away.

**Instead buy ERJ**. Embraer is the the third largest plane maker in the world and we really need more planes right now.

**Bullish:**

* They have a young portfolio of really well engineered aircraft: their executive jets have been the best selling for the last ~10 years and continue to see increased demand, their commercial narrow body planes, the E2 series, are the quietest, cleanest, and cheapest to fly regionally, even besting Airbus in most situations. Passengers rate them highly for comfort and they are very reliable.
* Their new C-390 Millennium military transport plane looks like it is taking off, with huge new orders from top tier militaries like South Korea and Saudi Arabia. The C-390 is superior in almost every way to the ancient Lockheed Martin C-130. If the C-390 replaces the C-130, that will means massive orders down the line and huge long term maintenance contracts. South Korea is known as a particularly efficient military, and will prove to be an excellent showcase.
* Airbus and Boeing are booked SOLID for 8-12 years, whereas Embraer has only ~3 years of backlog for their commercial planes. Embraer is much more likely to benefit from the manufacturing and brand struggles of Boeing than airbus.
* Profit from the maintenance unit has been bullish, this is a lagging indicator of fundamental business strength.
* Their aircraft have some of the lowest life cycle costs and highest uptime, the main reason they are not a 50-100B company is because of the Boeing / Airbus duopoly (as well as the SCOPE clause, see bearish below), which is starting to look like less of an obstacle.
* Many US carriers are rightfully pissed at Boeing and want more options. Some have openly questioned their commitments to orders currently on the books. Who else can they buy from? Not Airbus unless they want to wait forever. That leave only ERJ.
* They recently received ETOPS 120-minute approval from Brazil's ANAC, the FAA, and the EU's EASA for the E190-E2 and E195-E2 - more opportunity for sales in more markets.
* Their CEO, Francisco Gomes Neto is a badass. He was meant to lead the company sale to Boeing, but that fell through due to COVID and Boeing backing out. The reason Boeing wanted to purchase Embraer? For their well respected engineering talent. In other words, they are the Boeing of 40 years ago. Of course pulling out of the deal majorly fucked Embraer, which was about to release a major competitor to Boeing (E175-E2) in the US market (still on ice to this day). For the last ~3 years, Neto has been rebuilding Embraer into a fundamentally strong company with a great culture. He seems honest and upfront, in total contrast to Boeing's constant PR bullshit. Also worth noting - since Boeing pulled out they have been trying to poach Embraer engineer. Embraer has only lost around 100 engineers (according to last earnings call) and are suing Boeing. Embraer is like the young scrappy upstart with all the potential, and are just now hitting their growth spurt. Boeing has been keeping them down but are now weakened.
* Morgan Stanley recently upgraded their price target from $19 to $40, Goldman Sachs increased theirs from $21 to $35. 
* They just inked a huge deal with American Airlines for $7B - 90 aircraft. This could be the start of much wider industry adoption. Once the dominoes start to fall and their order book grows, ERJ will explode in value.

**Bearish:**

* They have been limited in selling their popular narrow body jets in the US market due to protectionist SCOPE clauses which limit the specific type of aircraft allowed at regional airports. There is no plan to have this scrapped in the next ~3 years. HOWEVER, if and when SCOPE is scrapped, expect a huge boost for ERJ.

* ERJ faces the long term ""pilot problem"" of not having enough pilots trained with their craft, combined with an overall pilot shortage means its difficult for some airlines to adopt them.

>The U.S. Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise interest rates by at least a 25 basis points next week. And if inflation stays high, the Fed is ‚Äúprepared to raise by more than that‚Äù in the coming months, Chair Jerome Powell said last week.  
>  
>That would be a mistake. After next week‚Äôs hike, the Fed should hit pause for at least the next several months and possibly through the summer ‚Äî even though the war in Ukraine will no doubt make inflation worse in the U.S.  
>  
>It‚Äôs unclear how bad the conflict will get, the effect it will have on the region and whether it will lead to a global recession this year. The probability of that last is less than the most extreme predictions, but is nonetheless real.  
>  
>A more aggressive Fed might use a recession as an opportunity to rapidly bring down inflation by sticking to its rate-hike schedule. That is risky policy, and one that [Powell seems disinclined to take](https://archive.ph/ybhBA). If a recession hit, it‚Äôs likely that the Fed would simply have to reverse any rate hikes it had made in the preceding months.  
>  
>A see-saw pattern in rates would weaken the overall impact of the Fed‚Äôs policy. Consider, for example, the plight of a homebuilder who cuts production next summer in response to rising rates. She is not likely to increase production immediately if rates fall in December; she‚Äôd want to wait for a signal that rates will remain low for a while. From the Fed‚Äôs perspective, it would be more effective to leave rates alone, encouraging her to keep production high for the next several months.  
>  
>There are also risks to consider beyond outright recession. The direct costs of higher energy and food prices will cut into consumer savings. Even more important, spiking commodity prices are likely to dent consumer confidence, leading to reduced spending on other items.  
>  
>Another consideration is the effect of the war on developing markets around the world. Higher food and energy prices will hit their economies harder. Global uncertainty will lead investors to move funds out their markets and into the U.S. That could cause a drop in the demand for U.S. exports, which are geared toward investment goods such as heavy machinery. That would reproduce some of the effects of the mini-recession that swept the Midwest in 2015 and 2016.  
>  
>At the same time, money flowing into the U.S. from both developing markets and Western Europe will cause the dollar to rise and the relative prices of imports to fall. As consumer spending shifts toward imports, that will cool some of the underlying inflationary pressures in the U.S.  
>  
>The near-term environment is complex. It‚Äôs unclear how long the war will last and how far-reaching its effects will be. The ideal Fed response, however, is straightforward: **Go ahead with the rate hike next week. But make it clear that there won‚Äôt be any more for at least two more meetings, and then only as the fallout from the war in Ukraine becomes more certain.**",0.025000000000000022,2022-03-11,1

Oddly enough though, they've been working closely together to patch the MCAS software for months. This is the software many believe led to the Lion Air crash last year.

I've seen the arguments from the bulls here about the smoke and sputtering noises before the crash, leading some to believe that this is an isolated incident. The eerie similarity is in how the Ethiopian flight just decided to nose dive directly into the ground after [experiencing unstable vertical speed after takeoff](https://twitter.com/flightradar24/status/1104671024581357568). Just like the Lion Air crash.  It's not crazy to think some kind of mechanical failure happened, the pilots attempted to compensate, and this piece of software decided it knew best and sent the jet crashing towards earth.

You'd have to be both retarded and blind not to recognize that both of these organizations understood the dangers of these jets, and continued to let them fly. 2 out of the (350) 737 MAX 8's in commercial use have violently nose dived mere minutes after take off. Killing every passenger and crew member in both instances. ROUGHLY .6% OF THESE FUCKING DEATH TRAPS HAVE EXPLODED WITH LESS THAN 2 YEARS OF USE UNDER THEIR BELT. That is insane.

&#x200B;

So what's my point here? *Culpability.*  Both the FAA and $BA have stated that these planes are just fine, yet they're actively working to solve the safety issues. They've got nearly 400 fatalities on their hand at this point, have essentially admitted guilt with their condolences and software development, yet rather than admitting they fucked up the first time around, they're doubling down.

To make matters worse, take a look at the [insider trading records from the last few months](https://i.imgur.com/7OXK6B6.png). I suppose an argument could be made that these execs were just cashing in on historically high prices. What's really fucking odd though is the EVP and General Counsel to $BA gifted half of his shares to an undisclosed party, and the other half of his shares to his wife, who then transferred to a trust on October 29th 2018. Yes, that's the [date of the first 737 MAX 8 crash](https://i.imgur.com/yNaTwXK.png). What a coincidence. Then, a few weeks after the black box was dug out of the ocean, [he and his wife sell 8,500 shares, or 69% of their disclosed shares](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/12927/000122520819002329/xslF345X03/doc4.xml), on the open market. [It's worth noting that officials claimed it could take a few weeks to recover the data.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-indonesia-crash/no-public-details-on-crashed-lion-air-voice-recorder-until-final-report-indonesian-official-idUSKCN1PG08R) Oh, also, why the fuck would you close out the majority of your position when you just crushed earnings and were on the best bull run of the stocks life? Fuckin' weird man.

This is just one example. Go look up the other execs. Equally suspect shit going on with quite a few of the officers.

My theory? They've known these planes have anti-gravity problems and they were hoping to quietly fix the issue behind the scenes. Then another one of these jets falls out of the sky, which no one was prepared for, and the issue just became unmanageable.

&#x200B;

Who cares though, right? You should if you hold a bullish position on this stock. Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore, head of the House Transportation Committee, stated that  [""heads will roll at the FAA if they're not confident in their data and the safety of this plane""](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/feinstein-blumenthal-lead-dem-pressure-on-boeing-after-deadly-ethiopian-airlines-crash).

If that happens, let's be real here, heads are gonna to roll at GM as well. Once the investigations start, shit is gonna hit the fan. Remember what happened to Ford with the whole [exploding pinto scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Pinto#Legal_cases)? Around 1979  the corporation was *charged with murder,* paid a disclosed $128M ($450M today), and who knows how much they settled for out of court. Oh, and more importantly for you bulls, their [stock price plummeted by 66%](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/F/ford-motor/stock-price-history) and didn't recover for 3 years.

&#x200B;

# SHORT $BA

&#x200B;

**EDIT:** With GOL's (121) and China's (100) MAX 8's now grounded, that means more than 2/3's of the global fleet have been grounded. This doesn't count AeroMexico, Singapore, Indonesia, Ethiopia or the other countries/airlines taking similar action. This bitch is going down tomorrow.

A 737-800 crashed in china as many of you have probably heard and BA stock has sank. 

I would speculate confidently that the sell off was a knee jerk reaction due to people thinking it was another MAX, but it was not, it was the 800 variant. 

Furthermore, being a pilot myself, i dont see how this will fall on Boeing. This will likely be determined to be pilot error, as aviation authorities and airlines love to put the final blame on the pilot whenever they can. In this case, from what ive seen in the video, there is absolutely no way for an airplane to be descending at 30000 fpm like a missile straight into the ground from a manufacturers malfunction, considering the aircrafts age/variant, the only times ive seen this are either A) maintenance fucked up (i.e - the alaska airlines flight) or B) the pilots out the aircraft in an inadvertent attitude that became unrecoverable. 


*edit: the flight data recorder previously posted is incorrect. My thesis this was pilot error, however, has not changed*


In short, this will not fall on Boeing and likely pilot error, unfortunately. 

Buy BA because it will rebound.

\*THIS IS NOT INVESTMENT ADVICE. STRICTLY INFORMATIONAL\*

This is my first time posting on this subreddit. I hope this post can be welcomed with open arms like many other posts on this platform. This is a rather long post but it is definitely the most important one for not only this subreddit but Earth as a whole. I beg of you to take this post as serious as possible as I lay out claims that might not be considered ""realistic"" by some of you. Again, this is one of the most important issues of our time and I thought that it would be a great way to share this information with you guys since the spread of information on this platform is unmatched.

The issue that I am referring to above is the growing contact/sightings of possibly extraterrestrial or extra-dimensional beings and crafts on Earth. This is an issue that everyone in the world should be familiar with and allocate their greatest interest in order to find the truth behind this. This post is very unusual compared to the others on this subreddit as most posts are stock market related. However, I promise that I will show the intersectionality between this global issue and finance throughout this post.

I first began to become interested in this issue in December of 2020 while quarantined in South East Michigan when the former Israeli space security chief, Haim Eshed, announced to the Jerusalem Post that aliens are indeed real. He later stated in the interview with the reputable news source that extraterrestrials from distant planets are engaged in a ""Galactic Federation"" where important policies regarding issues between civilizations are made. Eshed exclaimed that the United States is in talks with the Galactic Federation and even have American representatives participating in meetings and research with these extraterrestrials in an underground base on Mars. The former space security chief states that the main purpose of the research is to understand ""the fabric of the universe"". Around this time, America's former president, Donald Trump, established the seventh branch of their military, the Space Force. Haim insists that Trump was briefed and is fully aware of this situation. He even says that Trump was ""on the verge"" of disclosing their existence, however, he was stopped by the Galactic Federation as they didn't want to cause ""mass hysteria"" due to the many conflicts we are facing today such as political divide, COVID-19, and degrading international relationships.

Keep in mind that Haim Eshed is the one of the most credible, reliable, high-ranking, and intelligent individuals in regards to this issue. This would be comparable to if the head of NASA announced that intelligent life from other planets is a reality and that they are in communication with our highest-ranking officials. It is also important to mention that Israel's space agency is one of the best as they are one of only seven countries on the planet that build and launch their own satellites into orbit. Not only that, but Israel and the United States have a very good relationship regarding not only trade but military operations as well. This means that information is without a doubt transferred between the countries' military in regards to warfare and space. You may be asking why Haim Eshed is going public with this reality-shattering information nine years after his retirement in 2011. He claims that a lot has changed in the scientific community and that ""if I had come up with what I‚Äôm saying today five years ago, I would have been hospitalized"". In the end, he stated that he is one of the most respected individuals in the academia setting and that he has ""nothing to lose. I‚Äôve received my degrees and awards"". Again, this is a man who served for 30 years as head of Israel's space program and is a three-time recipient of the Israel Security Award.

Here is the original Jerusalem Post article \*PLEASE READ\*: [Jerusalem Post Article](https://www.jpost.com/omg/former-israeli-space-security-chief-says-aliens-exist-humanity-not-ready-651405)

In December of 2017, the New York Times published an article entitled, *Glowing Auras and ‚ÄòBlack Money‚Äô: The Pentagon‚Äôs Mysterious U.F.O. Program.* This article was one of the first publications to give an in-depth investigation of the current state of U.S. intelligence about UFO's (unidentified flying objects) or UAP's (unidentified aerial phenomenons) as they are known today by the U.S. Government. In the NYT report, it provides evidence to prove the U.S. Government's involvement in research programs investigating UAP sightings. According to Defense Department officials, included in the $600 billion annual defense budget was a virtually impossible to find $22 million allocation of money to an unknown Pentagon program called the Advance Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP). The program's main responsibility was to examine proof of UAP's provided by various military sources and to determine whether or not it posed a threat to our country. The program was ran by a former military intelligence official named Luis Elizondo on the fifth floor of the Pentagon's C ring. The Defense Department has never acknowledged the existence of this program before and when asked about it recently they said that they shut it down in 2012. However, when the program's backers were asked about it, they confirmed that the Defense Department stopped funding back in 2012 but the program still continued to investigate several more episodes provided by service members until October of 2017 when Luis Elizondo resigned from the Pentagon to protest excessive government secrecy about this issue.

[New York Times Article \*PLEASE READ\*](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/16/us/politics/pentagon-program-ufo-harry-reid.html)

One of the most fascinating things about this program was the examining of videos showing encounters between these unknown objects and U.S. military aircrafts. Three videos on this subject were published by the New York Times entitled ""FLIR1"", ""GIMBAL"", and ""GOFAST"". The videos were taken by Navy fighter jets belonging to the USS Nimitz and USS Roosevelt. All three of these videos show cockpit display data, infrared imagery, and even audio communications between the pursuing pilots. The UAP's displayed in these videos showed unprecedented and ""impossible"" aerial maneuvers that is unmatched by any technology present on Earth at this time. One of the fighter pilots, Commander David Fravor, who was part of the F/A-18F team that attempted to intercept the UAPs in 2004, had only this to say to the *New York Times:* ‚ÄúI have no idea what I saw...It had no plumes, wings or rotors and outran our F-18s.‚Äù Another fighter pilot witness named Chad Underwood described the movement of the craft as ""not behaving by the normal laws of physics"". Furthermore, he described the UAP to not be ""behaving in a manner that‚Äôs predictable or is normal by how flying objects physically move"". In addition to this bizarreness, all the pilots involved stated that the crafts didn't produce a heat signature, fumes, or even a propulsion system. Overall, these crafts can only be labeled as otherworldly as they clearly aren't capable to be developed by our current standards of science and innovation according to these pilots and other significant figures in the scientific community.

[""GIMBAL"" Video Evidence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TumprpOwHY)

[""GOFAST"" Video Evidence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUrTsrhVce4)

Although these videos showed compelling evidence of extraterrestrial existence, it still was not confirmed by any government officials to be raw and genuine footage. Some of the videos actually surfaced on the Internet as early as 2007, as they were being passed around in various website forums. It wasn't until September of 2019, when a spokeswoman of the Pentagon confirmed that the released videos were in fact 100% real and recorded by Navy aviators. She also added that this was ""part of a larger issue of an increased number of training range incursions by unidentified aerial phenomena in recent years."" This was one of the first incidences of the U.S. Government confirming that unknown and physics-defying air crafts have entered U.S. airspace.

[Confirmation of Video Authenticity by Pentagon Representative](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ufo-video-authenticity-pentagon/)

More recently, in April of 2021, a new video published by [Mystery Wire](https://www.mysterywire.com/) showed yet another case of an unidentified aerial phenomenon. The video took storm on the web and showcased a swarm of pyramid shaped aircrafts hovering over a U.S. Navy destroyer in night vision. The UAP's flashed with bright lights and performed physics-defying maneuvers. Additionally, what stood out about this incident was that the crafts were ""transmedium"" vehicles, meaning that they could transition from air to water seamlessly. Also, three photos supposedly taken by Navy fighter jet pilots displayed three different shaped UAP's. The objects the Navy Personnel captured on his iPhone included a ""sphere"", an ""acorn"", and a ""metallic blimp"". Although the video clip and photos originally didn't seem to standout from the other UFO videos found on the Internet, it wasn't long for a spokeswoman from the Pentagon to confirm the authenticity of the video and photos. Susan Gough, the spokesperson for the Pentagon said that, ‚ÄúI can confirm that the referenced photos and videos were taken by Navy personnel. The UAPTF has included these incidents in their ongoing examinations.‚Äù As you can see, this is an ongoing issue that most likely happens very frequently. It wasn't until now that the people of America can really see what secrets the U.S. Government is hiding from its citizens.

Now you may be asking yourself ""what happens now?"" Well in last years' gargantuan $2.3 trillion appropriation bill that was mainly for COVID-19 relief aid for millions of Americans, contained a rider that was provided by the Senate Intelligence Committee. For anyone that doesn't know, a rider is when an additional provision is added to a bill while having little to do with the main subject matter of it. In this case, the rider mandated that the director of national intelligence works with the secretary of defense on a report to detail everything the U.S. Government knowns about UAP's. The small provision in the 5,500+ page bill also warranted that the report be released within 180 days of the bill being signed. Donald Trump signed the bill on December 27th, 2020 so that means that UAP disclosure should be released in early June. Some speculate that this report will contain all the secrets the U.S. Government has regarding unidentified aerial phenomenons while other say that they will only release the minimum amount of information in order to be labeled as a ""UFO report"". What do you think? I'd love to hear your opinion!

[UFO Disclosure Article](https://nypost.com/2020/12/29/covid-19-bill-started-a-180-day-countdown-for-ufo-disclosures/)

While this is potentially one of the greatest ongoing issues in human history, I'd like to take a minute to fulfill my promise of connecting this global issue to the stock market. All the evidence I provided were confirmed by some of the highest-ranking individuals on this planet. This means that there is a high probability of similar events occurring in the near future. These events could be increased UFO sightings, more government confirmations of UAP encounters, or even extraterrestrial contact. Overall, what is absolutely certain if any of these events take place, is the growing awareness of extraterrestrials/extra-dimensional beings by the general public. Based off human emotion, people will not take this news lightly. I truly believe that many humans will panic after hearing the startling news of unknown crafts traveling over their countries airspace without their country's military able to do anything about. People will instinctively go into a defensive state meaning that they will purchase more weapons like guns, knives, and ammunition. Some people will most likely even commit suicide due to the feeling of insignificance and defenselessness by this devastating news. Additionally, there will be a massive pushback against the U.S. Government because of this unprecedented and excessive government secrecy regarding this issue. Most likely the government will stay intact and billions of dollars will be put into the military as it is the only structured organization that can defend against this off-world threat. However, this will be the start to a new concept of what us humans call life.

What I stated above sounds absolutely horrific, however, our species need to recognize the fact that we may not be alone in this universe. New information we find on this issue will happen inevitably, it is more of a question of when. Investing in military defense stocks like Lockheed Martin ($LMT), Raytheon ($RTX), and Boeing ($BA) will be a great long term investment because I hypothesize that this situation is caused by only three scenarios. The first scenario is that there are extraterrestrials/extra-dimensional beings navigating the UAP's shown in the evidence above. The second scenario is that one of our country's nemesis like China or Russia has technologically leaped frogged us and created aircrafts that has defied our current understandings of physics. The final scenario is that the U.S. military has developed these crafts and in an attempt to keep our rivals from figuring out this information, they made a massive effort to hide it from the general public. All three of these scenarios ultimately conclude with the U.S. military's capabilities being expanded along with a giant budget increase. Higher budget means more money for big military companies like the ones stated above to develop cutting edge technology for the government. Again, whether this happens in June when UFO disclosure is released or 10 years from now when aliens make contact, this is an asymmetric trade meaning that the potential gains of buying defense stocks FAR exceed the potential losses.

Now if you can take one thing from this post, it is that information is ESSENTIAL. What the U.S. Government has held from its people, is the greatest intelligence failure in United States history. This global issue affects us all significantly and as people of Earth, we deserve to have this information told to us in full.

The spring of 2024 was a brutal one for the Boeing company. As the S&P 500 gained rapidly with tech taking it to new heights, Boeing was thrusted into an onslaught of lawsuits, order delays and leadership confidence decay the likes of which the company has never seen before. Long and regarded read, trust me I know. I had 4 aneurisms and 2 hospital visits writing this but I'm back on the saddle and ready for an FAA inspection.

So sit tight, have some peanuts, and take one side of the headphones off to listen to the Captain (me) report on what's cooking in Boeing. (not the engine this time)

[Boeing CEO testifies before U.S. senate.](https://preview.redd.it/td6upe19uofd1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2cc9178dc13339492c855c57f247785ebc484f95)

**Deliveries Deliveries  Deliveries**

First off, I want to preface this due diligence with I am in no way shape or form a financial advisor, a pilot, or an airline industry expert. I am a regarded individual who has recently taken interest in Boeing's future and welcomes a variety of critique on this matter. Okay with that out of the way lets actually dive into it (no pun intended)

**Difficulty in delivery for Spring**

**1. April -** In the month of April, the company managed to secure orders for just 7 aircraft (none were Max planes which the company has been trying hard to sell to various airlines)

**2. May -** For the month of May, Boeing was trailing Airbus for just 1 order of 4 787-10 Dreamliner aircraft from Taiwan. This suggests Boeing failed to acquire a *single* order for its 737 Max aircraft once again.

Highlighting these key delivery periods suggested the growing amount of concern over Boeing's engineering and management but coming out of the Farrmborough Intl Airshow in late July, investors of Boeing and its executives are beginning to feel little bit better about the state of the company.

Let's take a look at which airlines are putting their faith back into Boeing by ordering more Jets!

This list will follow orders of Aircraft type (smallest to largest)

**737 Max -**

**1.** On July 15th it was reported an American firm, ""*Aviation Capital Group""* confirmed a purchase of **16x 737 Max 8s** and **19x 737 Max 10s**.  (The CEO would later claim this purchase was supporting a key pillar in its growth strategy.)

**2.** On July 23rd, *Macquarie AirFinance* placed its first Boeing order with the purchase of **20x 737 Max 8s** to its backlog, with a slated delivery between 2029 and 2030.

**3.** Around the same time during the Farnborough, *Luxair* added **2x 737 Max 10s** for a confirmed purchased  while claiming optional order for **two more**.

**4.** Regarding slightly older news in early June, El AL opted for Boeing 737 Max over Airbus with an order of **30x 737 Max** aircraft totaling $2 billion dollars. Deliveries are expected in 2027\*\*.\*\* These orders could come before as slots become available.

**5.**  Air Canada in early July, added orders of **8x 737 Max 8s** via BOC Aviation and will be delivered over the coming months.

**787 Dreamliner** and the **777**

**1.** Japan Airlines confirmed a purchase for **10x 787-9s** and options for another **10x 787s** during this July of Farnborough. Deliveries are not set until 2028 but will go through till 2031.

**2.** Korean Air agreed to purchase up to **30x 787-10s** with options for another **10x**\*\*\*.\*\*\* Korean Air also opted for an order of **20x 777X** aircraft. According to chairman and CEO of Korean Air, the 777x could be the Korean's flagship aircraft *or* it could be Airbus's A350s. Time will tell on this one as its decided on which aircraft arrives at the airline *first*.

**3.** Quatar Airways added **20x** more **777-9s** to its backlog of **40.**

**4.** Turkish Airlines, in early July, announced an order of **4x 777Fs** to bolster its cargo fleet.

**5.** A week before Farnborough in early July,  Emirates SkyCargo placed a firm order of **5x 777Fs.** A delivery that would increase its main deck capacity of its cargo jets by 30 percent. The $1 billion deal will deliver between 2025 and 2026.

**6.** Last but not least. National Airlines placed its first direct purchase from Boeing with **4x 777Fs.**

**Production Production Production**

This July we saw the first confirmed production of the GE9X engine, from GE Aerospace, headed for Boeing. With the engineering achievement of this engine,  its good news for the 777x Program and GE as they've reportedly ran into issues testing this thing. In mid July, Boeing confirmed they had received type inspection authorization from the FAA for the 777X which has now paved the way for certification in flight testing with US regulators now on board.

I believe this is a crucial stepping stone for Boeing to get these 777s into commercial flight as we are so close to the finish line for these jets.

**China China China**

Positive news (finally) has come out regarding China and Boeing. Boeing has officially resumed widebody jet deliveries to China following some deliveries of 777 freighters. This was after a two-month hiatus forced by regulators reviewing the jets. Recently, Boeing 737 Max planes also resumed delivery to China as well.

**Light at the End?**

Well Boeing simply put isn't just out of the woods yet with an ongoing FAA production camp causing numerous delivery delays with airlines customers. Importantly, the company finalized its guilty plea agreement with the DOJ for ""failing to sufficiently design, implement and enforce a compliance and ethics program to prevent and detect violations of US fraud law.""

As cool as it was to hear the Boeing CEO repeat that he just simply ""gets paid to run the Boeing company,"" as he was questioned. Plans are already set to replace the CEO and other operation changes that will further consumer confidence in the near-term and long-term effectiveness of Boeing.

**Conclusion** and **Positions**

Boeing has been on thin ice for a while and I believe the ice is thickening and will soon be on track in a green pasture heading to TendyVille. Defense contracting is on the rise, take a look at $LMT earnings, Boeing's confidence is returning and so will its stock price.

Boeing (BA) receives order for 45 fighter jets from Germany,228,g4bxpy,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g4bxpy/boeing_ba_receives_order_for_45_fighter_jets_from/,120,2020-04-19 23:17:44,"[https://www.yahoo.com/news/germany-order-45-fighter-jets-162946385.html](https://www.yahoo.com/news/germany-order-45-fighter-jets-162946385.html)

Boeing is still getting orders for aircraft, despite their MAX debacle. Remember how hard their stock jumped just on news of reopening their factory in Washington? The fact of the matter is that despite BA's poor performance, they are nearly a monopoly in the world of combat aircraft. We will still continue to see orders like this, and that marks a positive sentiment for BA.

I had already purchased BA 7/17 300C on Friday. I hope this news causes a decent uptick on Monday. I think in the current situation, at least until we see whether COVID returns with a vengeance when we attempt to reopen, that BA can only really go up at the time being.",0.0,2020-04-19,5

$GME Technical Analysis: Waves go Brrr,4983,mz5e3m,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mz5e3m/gme_technical_analysis_waves_go_brrr/,434,2021-04-27 00:41:34,"Hi Fam, its me, Fam. 

There is something going on with GME and it may be  **imminent**
This is my interpretation of GME thru wave counting/elliotwave. 

Refer to this image first : https://i.imgur.com/CR0OiQJ.jpg

From a yearly point of view, we have accomplished wave 1(A) and wave 2(B) colored blue for those colored blind (idk how that works). We are in the mist of forming wave C.  That will be interpreted in the following paragraph. From this standpoint, we have strong support level at 23.6 fib level (priced 142.79). It was actually broken, but that level was a *test* to see how far it will go down. It found support again (twice) on several different locations (weeks later) This is very important because the psychology of the market (investors) show a threshold and now pointing towards a bullish movement - even though we were consolidating. Now, per elliot wave analysis, Wave 3 is the **BIGGEST** wave of the 5 wave formation. It  must past the high of 488.51 in order to be called a elliot wave 3 or C wave. There are several *mini* resistance levels we must past but as I am typing, we pushed past two of them. The next important level of all is Price $200 which is surprisingly at fib level 38.2. Thats a magic number for later. We can *predict where Wave 3 may end* and that number is 504 .34- 531.72. (math not included) 

Refer to image: https://i.imgur.com/cw86Lhx.jpg
This image basically tells me half time is over and the bell just rung. The pendant is forming or has already formed.  Its a signal and confirms the psychoanalysis of market (retail investors and all) that there is a upward movement. However, there needs to be a stimulus or break out movement out. This image now focuses on our micro analysis of wave 3 (C). Wave 1 of wave C has completed and assumingly so, wave 2 (b) of bigger wave 3 is consolidating (pendant). Quick fib analysis: We find resistance at fib level 23.6 (priced at 169.26). Then again we have fib level 38.2 hovering around price 200 (remember this - important later down the road). If we want some kind of breakout, we need to close above 200, followed by some stimulus (upward movement factor). In addition, this pendant formed a higher lows but also lower highs (consolidation). 

On the daily,
* if we close above 169-170, thats a great start
* Then close above 200, price movement is building momentum for wave C - which should have the biggest momentum of all 5 waves
* Theoretically, it needs to close above 351.90 to confirm wave 3(C), but remember thats only the smaller version of Wave 3. 

If this happens, it can theoretically push bigger wave 5 to around 800 (depends on market volatility and demand) to XXXXs. 

 TLDR: Wave 3's forming. There is a pressure on GME market and it may be bullish movement from now on. Consolidation may be done if it can close above micro support levels.

National Security risks of hedge fund over-leveraging,3709,mfxfuo,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mfxfuo/national_security_risks_of_hedge_fund/,405,2021-03-30 00:59:55,"This is brushing up against politics a bit, so we'll see if it survives mod attention.

With two recent high profile incidents of hedge funds becoming irresponsibly overleveraged in the market (Melvin Capital and Archegos) and causing market wide effects, it seems worth exploring the national security implications of continued poor oversight of institutional leverage in equities markets, and the potential economic effects. 

With numerous countries with adversarial relationships to the US and NATO powers having a much more managed approach to their citizens business ventures and economic output, it is not far fetched to consider that overleveraging can become a tactic of economic warfare, and a way of winning or setting advantageous conditions for wars without firing a shot. 

China is the classic and most probable candidate for this, so we'll start with them as an example. Consider their practice of internment and reeducation for Chinese leaders of businesses who become problematic for the state, such as Jack Ma with Alibaba. Consider also their fairly commonly known practice of leveraging western students and workers of Chinese descent in order to commit industrial espionage. From these two points, we can consider a hypothetical scenario where the CCP could engineer a domino crash through planned use of leveraging and defaults, either through a single action (apply pressure to an economic agent to both become overleveraged and then insolvent) or multistep (apply pressure to one or several agents to become over-leveraged, and then act seperately to cause a disruption in that area and subsequent defaults).

The utility of this sort of attack is twofold. It can be used to provide a distraction on demand, where unwanted attention on international affairs could be diverted by engineering a domestic economic crisis, compounded with social media campaigns. It could also be used as a prelude to military action, in order to attack a country's defense contracting and solvency for defense spending indirectly, while at the same time sowing internal strife to reduce the capability for a decisive and coherent response to provocation.

This type of attack would be difficult to predict and mitigate the effects of as either a retail or institutional investor, as it could be triggered with little to no warning from traditional indicators. Hedging against it would be tricky as well, but would most likely be found with plays on defense contractors such as $OSK, $BA, $LMT, ect. if the situation escalated to armed conflict. In this case, the saying ""an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure"" holds very true, as the best course of action would be addressing the use of leverage by institutional investors before a state actor uses it as an instrument of war. 

TLDR; Institutional leverage can and will be exploited at some point as a form of economic warfare by state actors, causing pre-planned recessions or economic crashes.

James McNerney started in McKinsey, then became the hand-trained monkey of Jack Welch in GE. He became Boeing CEO in 2005 & he was the guy when the 737 MAX was being designed. Remember, Jack Welch was the CEO of Century just before retirement from GE & then the fraud of Century as GE crashed and burned with all of his accounting frauds being discovered. He wasn't fined a penny.

Dennis Muilenburg had started at Boeing as an intern, so he was scapegoated as CEO in 2015 and then was fired in 2019 taking the blame for 737 MAX fuck ups.

Dave Calhoun who is another Jack Welch-trained monkey, with 25 years of GE experience, replaced Muilenburg & of course, Boeing is in its current state.

[DD] Here's what you're missing on the Boeing Safety Crisis,922,192j6ib,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/192j6ib/dd_heres_what_youre_missing_on_the_boeing_safety/,230,2024-01-09 22:19:00,"A 737 MAX losing a window mid-flight is a terrible PR disaster, but on its own just that. A PR disaster that will blow over. However, unfortunately for Dave Calhoun and all the BA bag holders, the timing could not be worse.

You see, BA has been trying to sneak through safety exclusions for the upcoming 737 MAX-7 and MAX-10. And they were about to get away with it too. But now this PR disaster has awoken the sleeping giant that is American consumers, just in time for them to realize that they have BA by the balls.

**The Airworthiness Directive**

Back in August, the FAA published a [little-noticed Airworthiness Directive](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/08/10/2023-17197/airworthiness-directives-the-boeing-company-airplanes) where they state that the engine anti-icing (EAI) system on all 737 MAXs can bring down the entire plane if left on for **FIVE MINUTES** too long. Direct quotes:

>the use of EAI in dry air for more than five minutes during certain combinations of altitude, total air temperature, and N1 settings can result in engine inlet cowl temperatures exceeding design limits

&#x200B;

>The departure of the inlet may cause fuselage and/or window damage, potentially resulting in decompression and hazard to window-seated passengers aft of the wing and/or impact damage to the wing, flight control surfaces, and/or empennage, which could result in loss of control of the airplane

Okay that's not so bad right? Just add some temperature sensors and/or an alarm for the pilots so they can take corrective action? Surely that would be the FAA's imposed remedy?

Nope. FAA said pop a disclaimer in your manual and you're good. Look at this fucking shit right here:

[we fixed it they said](https://preview.redd.it/g0mkh3g3pfbc1.png?width=934&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3afe9861704b72194e9941b6e5c567ba754716d)

Imagine for a single second that your car had this problem. That if you left your fucking window defogger for 5 minutes too long, your wheels might start popping off. What would happen? Instant recall. Pull the cars into the shop, fix them. And of course, stop making new cars until the problem if fixed.

Ok obviously planes are different than cars. And we all wanted to go home for the holidays to see grandma once more time before she kicks the can so nobody wanted to see the MAX fleet grounded and flights cancelled.

**The Request for Safety Exemption**

That AD was already terrible timing for Boeing, since they're trying hard to get the MAX-7 certified, and it has the exact same engine melting problem.

The next piece of the puzzle comes in last month, when Boeing [formally petitions for their upcoming MAX-7 to be Exempt from a handful of safety regulations](https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/boeing-wants-faa-to-exempt-max-7-from-safety-rules-to-get-it-in-the-air/).

They want to slap the same warning in the manual and sell these puppies to Southwest, so you can start riding them next year.

They know their existing fleet of 737 MAX has a safety issue. They won't ground them to fix them. They won't stop making new MAX-8 and MAX-9 with the safety issue. And now they want to release a new model that they know is unsafe on day 1.

The request is egregious. You should [look at it yourself](https://www.regulations.gov/docket/FAA-2023-2340/document). But just look at these two parts in particular:

https://preview.redd.it/2w3ik0shvfbc1.png?width=1546&format=png&auto=webp&s=5112e7351158cfa2573372c356b86c1749d443f0

https://preview.redd.it/7tgph3qnvfbc1.png?width=1742&format=png&auto=webp&s=0817077491d259ec026ddb251947024ab8da2b1a

They're saying - we have a failure condition that can lead to catastrophic (i.e. everyone dies) failure and our lawyers agree it's not ""extremely improbable"". But don't worry, we have a fix that relies on pilots never forgetting the 5-minute rule, and also we won't take into account their human needs as part of our safety system.

But don't worry, they'll have a real fix by ... mid 2026

**Reading between the** **~~lies~~** **lines**

They want us to believe that the company with a [history of deliberately hiding info from the FAA](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/boeing-charged-737-max-fraud-conspiracy-and-agrees-pay-over-25-billion) noticed a theoretical issue by ""analyzing the data"". The same inlet that doesn't have a basic temperature sensors to alert pilots of overheating has sensors to detect issues like this?

BULLSHIT. After a dry flight over the American southwest, some good mechanic noticed that this part was halfway fucking melted and told his boss. They ran it up the chain, had their ""oh shit"" moment, and then instead of working on a fix, went straight to work covering their asses to limit liability. Tell the FAA so that FAA can issue the AD with the shit remedy, then if a plane crashes they can say FAA gave them permission. Oh and they can just blame the pilots ([like they did last time](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-11-16/are-boeing-planes-unsafe-pilots-blamed-for-corporate-errors-in-max-737-crash))  for forgetting the 5 minute rule. Stupid pilots. Stop flirting with the stewardess and set your 5 minute timer again

At the same time, they're using [leaks to the press](https://simpleflying.com/boeing-nearing-certification-737-max-7-10-october-2023/) to put the screws on the FAA. They've hyped the stock, so now if they FAA blocks them all the BA bag holders will be mad at the FAA, and FAA will be forced to make the good 'ole boys at Boeing look bad.

**Boeing didn't learn their lesson**

These are the same people who killed 346 people due to their negligence and prioritization of profit over quality. THEY HAVEN'T FUCKING CHANGED

People have noticed. People are sick of Boeing's bullshit. Absolutely sick. Take a look at any reddit thread on Boeing, twitter, TikTok, hacker news. Everywhere. People are talking about how they will avoid these 737 MAXs like the plague and fly Airbus only.

But Boeing isn't worried. They know how short the consumer attention span is. We'll all forget in a few weeks, they're hoping and planning

**We Aren't Priced In**

This subreddit took down a hedge fund in 2021, for the fun of saving a fan-favorite video game store and the joy of stopping egregious greed in its track

It's time to do it again.

I say fuck you Dave Calhoun. Fuck you Boeing execs. I'm sick of these shitty planes. I'm sick of the lies, sick of the lack of transparency. Sick of the huge Wall Street payouts while corners are cut again and again in production. Its time for a reckoning. It's time for Boeing to once again become a symbol of great American engineering, not a symbol of Wall Street greed.

And I believe we can make this happen. Not on our own of course, but we are not alone. The American people are angry from the 2019 crashes. They're angry about the window popping out. They're angry about this safety exclusion.

All they need is a vanguard to show the way.

Our demand is simple - NO SAFETY EXCLUSION. FAA must not grant it. If they do, Southwest must not buy these airplanes. If they do, I'M NOT FUCKING RIDING IN THEM

IMO, trading options have similarities to playing poker and in order to be successful in the long run you need to be disciplined and refrain from making common mistakes. I‚Äôm going to list common mistakes and some tips here. Please suggest more. Hope we all lose less tendies!

1. Refrain to trade low volume options . These contracts will have really wild bid/ask spread, or really low volume, which reduces your chance to make profit significantly. For example how can you win if you trade $ROPE 100c when the bid ask spread is $69/$96 per contract?
2. Refrain to trade very low price options (e.g 1-10 cents) because your broker commissions will eat up a significant amount of the transactions. Think how much commissions you have to pay to buy 10000 contracts of 0.01 $ROPE 1000c which costs $10000 of premium.
3. Refrain to buy near-dated far OTM options, because this is almost a sure way to burn your money. Even worse, even if you guess the direction right, you may still have a substantial loss. Think $PEI 500% OTM 2DTE. Btw $PEI is a great stock to own. Example: on 04/13 you bought SPY 496c 04/17 when SPY=280. On 04/14 SPY rises to 285. Guess how much you made on your call options?
4. Know when to select OTM vs ITM options: in general: OTM is higher risk/higher return. Have some sense of OTM price movement - even when you guess the direction right, far OTM options won‚Äôt make you money because of low delta. ITM is more expensive. ATM is typically a safe choice if you just want to make a directional bet.
5. Know theta-crush. Your options will lose time-value every day, so refrain from buying short-dated options unless you know what you're doing.
6. Know the effects of IV (VIX for SPY) on options price. Sometimes even when you guess the direction rights, you may lose money because of VIX movements. Know how to hedge for VIX movement.
7. Refrain from using market orders when possible: limit orders will give you the price you want.
8. Understand the margin impact of different options strategies.
9. Understand the impact of your broker commissions.
10. Bank management: never YOLO your entire portfolio into one position, because if you lose, there‚Äôs 0% chance to make it back. Learn [http://www.thepokerbank.com/strategy/basic/bankroll-management/](http://www.thepokerbank.com/strategy/basic/bankroll-management/). If you want to get in a large (50K+) position, average in/out may be a good idea.
11. Don't open too many positions unless you're a bot. It's hard to manage manually and easy to make mistakes.
12. (Mostly) don't follow autist DDs that you can't explain.
13. Learn the market hours!
14. Options strategies can be complex to visualized. Use your broker's performance profile tool to understand the performance implications before making a trade.

**Some risky options strategies that you should only do when you know what you‚Äôre doing**

* Naked puts, i.e. short puts: very risky especially in a recession: when the underlying crashes you‚Äôll lose lots of money
* Synthetic shorts: i.e. long puts + sell calls, also very risky, only know when you‚Äôre 90% sure of the direction.
* Naked calls, i.e. short calls: also pretty risky if the underlying moons.
* ‚Ä¶

**Less risky options strategies:**

1. Covered calls: very low risk. You hold shares, and sell OTM calls to cover them and collect the premium.
2. Cash secured puts: sell puts but you have cash to cover it. This is good when you‚Äôre willing to buy the shares if it drops, otherwise you collect the premium.
3. Diagonal: Simultaneously entering into a long and short position in two options of the same type (two call options or two put options) but with different strike prices and different expiration dates. Typically these structures are on a 1 x 1 ratio. This is less risky and can hedge you against IV as well. For example if you bearish on USO, buy a 4p 05/15 and sell a 3.5p 04/24, that way if USO moves upward on the week ending 04/24 you‚Äôll collect the near-dated premium.
4. Learn how to sell options. Every mistake you made as an option buyer is probably a chance for you to profit as an option-seller.

**Practical tips**

1. Use tools to scan top volume options. [https://www.barchart.com/options/volume-leaders](https://www.barchart.com/options/volume-leaders) . This can give you some confirmation.
2. Use tools to scan unusual activity options. [https://www.barchart.com/options/unusual-activity](https://www.barchart.com/options/unusual-activity) Try to think why people are making that trade. Your broker also has tools to scan these.
3. Take advantage of L2 flow data if your broker provides.
4. Sometime when you can't make a long-term directional bet, it may be profitable to day-trade or swing-trade (hold your positions for 1-3 days).
5. Know common ETFs:

* SPY: everyone knows this. The most liquid options to trade.
* IWM: tracks Russell 2000. Also pretty liquid. Trade this if you don't want expose to big techs.
* Sector specific ETFs: XLE, XLF, XLC, etc. Also highly liquid.
* Country specific ETFs: EWU, EWG, EWC, EWA, EWJ ... fairly liquid.
* Gold: GLD
* Silver: SLV
* Oil: USO (make sure you really understand this; it doesn't track oil price)
* Options of individual stocks: in general, the more liquid the underlying, the more liquid the options, e.g. AMZN, BA, FB, TSLA, ...

**Things to debate**

* On March 15, 2020 ProShares Capital Management LLC announced that it plans to close and liquidate ProShares UltraPro 3x Crude Oil ETF (ticker symbol: OILU) and ProShares UltraPro 3x Short Crude Oil ETF (ticker symbol: OILD). Each fund trades on NYSE Arca. The last day the funds will accept creation orders is March 27, 2020. Trading in each Fund will be suspended prior to market open on March 30, 2020. Proceeds of the liquidation are currently scheduled to be sent to shareholders on or about April 3, 2020 (the ‚ÄúDistribution Date‚Äù).
* Shareholders may sell their shares of a Fund (subject to any applicable brokerage or transaction costs) until the market close on March 27, 2020. From March 30, 2020 through the Distribution Date, shares of the Funds will not be traded on NYSE Arca and there will not be a secondary market for the shares. During this period, each Fund will be in the process of liquidating its portfolio and will not be managed in accordance with its investment objective.
* These strategies are intended to allow an Oil Fund to preserve a minimal portion of its value in the event of significant adverse movements in a Fund‚Äôs benchmark. There can be no guarantee that an Oil Fund will be able to implement such strategies or that such strategies will be successful. Each Oil Fund will incur additional, potentially substantial, costs as a result of such strategies which may cause or increase tracking error and would be expected to have a substantial adverse impact on performance. Use of such strategies would cause an Oil Fund to not perform consistent with its investment objective. Furthermore, in the event that an Oil Fund‚Äôs value decreases by 70% or more at any point from its prior day‚Äôs NAV, as determined by the Sponsor, the Sponsor, in its sole discretion, in order to maintain the integrity of the ongoing operation of the Fund or for other reasons, may cause such Fund to liquidate some or all of its positions and, in lieu of such positions, invest such assets in cash or money market instruments. The above actions may be taken without prior notification to shareholders and would be expected to cause an Oil Fund not to perform consistent with its investment objective. Under these circumstances, consistent with its general authority, the Sponsor may, but is not obligated to, cause an Oil Fund to be terminated and dissolved.",0.5,2020-04-23,1

From pre crash to the bottom of ba, Ba bounced off the 50% retracement;  https://imgur.com/a/8EwwfZL 

So it bounced- where is it going? From the recent lows from where it started to go up, to the highs from yesterday the retracement; https://imgur.com/a/RLpqygd; lands it at around 188. That is why I think it.

Reason it might not work- BA has extreme strength right now and Fomo buyers might blow through the resistance because a lot of times lines dont mean anything.

Tldr: BA 200P 6/12 or 6/19 to be safe, tp around 188 and stop if a 4hr candle lands above 225. If BA gaps up to 220, ignore this post. And I am waiting for it to pass the 14ema on the 1 hour",0.0,2020-06-06,5

BA needed to engage an entire syndicate of banks to gather a $12 billion term loan facility to make ends meet (you don't do that kind of shit if you have cash on hand).

One of those banks was JPMorgan Chase, [who just downgraded their outlook for Boeing](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jp-morgan-abandons-boeing-buy-093927182.html ""who the fuck does that to someone they just lent 12 billion dollars?"")


~~Their common stock float is 5,061,000,000 (five billion shares).~~

Stupid fucking Yahoo finance data derived; actual float is 563.15M

They typically pay $2 per share per quarter, meaning they'll have to depart with ~~10~~ 1 billion dollars per quarter to keep the dividend steady.

If the Max 8 is not approved by the FAA on or before Thu 07 May 2020 (the next expected ex dividend date), BA will blow ~~almost all~~ over 4 billion (one third) of its credit line on the dividend issuance (dividend issuance + three months of bleed out) 

I expect their dividend to be cut in half (minimum), in line with the expected Fed's additional 50 basis point cut that will take the risk free rate, effectively, to zero.  This will buy BA somewhere between two to three quarters before things really start to go off the rails, potentially producing a GE-like outcome.",0.0,2020-03-13,4

I will try to keep this short because I understand most of you ADHD autistic regards have the attention span of a 3 year old.  I am going to lay out the bull and bear case for Bitcoin.

Bull Case:

Bitcoin has a 4 year cycle, centered around the halving event.  Here is a list of the low to high price after each halving. 

2012 Halving: $12.40

13 months later: $1,170

2016 Halving: $535

18 months later: $19,400

2020 Halving: $8,590

18 months later: $69,000

There are diminishing returns each cycle, so the first one was about 95x, second cycle was 35x and the third cycle was 8x.  As you can see, this next cycle should be around 2-3x from the price at the halving, but the halving isn't until next month and we are already at $73,000.  Let's just go with the current price, the peak should be $146,000 - $219,000 per Bitcoin around 18 months from now.

Bear Case:

BiTcOiN mUh fAkE mUuNeY, bItCoIn BaD, BiTcOiN StOoPiD.  I bUy ShInEy YeLlOw RoCk.

TL;DR:  Buy Bitcoin (not financial advice) before you miss out and FOMO in a year from now at $120,000 like the regarded ghey bear you are.

Boeing has had a rough couple of years. In 2019 the 737 MAX was grounded and in 2020 the pandemic saw a massive slowdown in revenue for Boeing. The stock went from $446 to about $350 when the 737 was grounded, to a low of $89 in March because of the pandemic, and is now trading at around $210.

As the vaccine rolls out, and the 737 being approved for service, I think Boeing is one of the last great covid recovery plays and I think we will definitely see a reversal of their fortune in the long term, with great short term potential as well.

Operating as a duopoly with Airbus, Boeing has an exemplary economic moat and has years of backlog that will provide some good revenue. They have a history of providing military aircraft to the US and abroad. They are not going anywhere, regardless of the potential dropoff in civilian air traffic.

They've found strong support at this current level, and I think this is the start of the climb back to their pre covid/pre 737 price. Wouldn't be surprised if it is flirting with $500-600 in the next couple of years.

A Basic Introduction to Vertical Spreads - Stop Losing Money When You Predict the Correct Direction,1837,gk3bq3,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gk3bq3/a_basic_introduction_to_vertical_spreads_stop/,339,2020-05-15 11:11:34,"**Vertical Spread Basics**

Spreads often get a bad rap for sounding more complex than they end up being. I‚Äôd wager quite  a few people here don‚Äôt even know what the ‚ÄúSelect‚Äù button is for at the top right of the options screen on Robinhood. I see over and over people losing their money with puts or calls when a vertical spread would have accomplished the same thing but better. To keep this basic I will stick to vertical spreads (both credit and debit) and a bit about Iron Condors, and once that‚Äôs done I‚Äôll go into a bit of detail about when and where I use them.


A vertical option spread is purchasing two options; one you‚Äôre buying and one you‚Äôre selling. You‚Äôre literally trading based on the difference between the two option prices. For example, if I bought a SPY 300c 6/3 and sold a SPY 305c 6/3, I would have a SPY 6/3 305/300 Call Debit Spread. What do we accomplish by both buying and selling the right to 100 shares of SPY though? The short answer: **This defines our risk.** This can seem kind of difficult to comprehend, but it‚Äôs fairly simple: **[The value of the spread can never be more than the difference between the two strike prices.](https://imgur.com/xzfCFbD)** 

For the above mentioned trade, we can currently purchase a SPY 6/3 305/300 Call Debit Spread for [$0.65 per share](https://imgur.com/IzXOAeW) ($0.65*100=$65), meaning that the difference in price between the 305c and the 300c is $0.65. If SPY finishes above $305 on 6/3, our 300c we bought finishes in the money as does the 305c we sold, which means the spread between the two option prices has reached its maximum of $5.00. We can now purchase 100 shares of SPY at $300 then sell them to the holder of the option we sold for $305, netting $5 per share for a neat $500. This means that we can make up to $500-$65 = $435 on the trade, a tidy 769% profit. 


If you take anything away from this write up, please take this:

***An easy way to view a SPY 6/3 305/300 Call Debit Spread is then that you‚Äôre betting $65 to win $500 as long as SPY ends above $305 on 6/3.***


If you‚Äôre not starting to see why vertical spreads are more intuitive than single calls or puts then I encourage you to look back over the paragraph above. The Greeks still matter a lot, but the trade can easily be distilled to the above sentence which is not the case with a single option. I continually see people buying calls and puts, correctly predicting the direction of the market, and still losing money due to IV deterioration or the price not moving enough in the right direction. Vertical spreads simplify the trade by making it only as complicated as you want it to be. If you simply want to bet that a stock will go up over the next month, just set the strikes up to straddle the current price, for example, a SPY 290/280 Call Debit spread. Similarly if you wanted to be against the market, you would do the same thing but by buying a 290 put and selling a 280 put making a SPY 290/280 Put Spread. 


A credit spread is very similar to a debit spread but inverted. To create a SPY 6/3 300/305 Call Credit spread, we would sell a 300c and buy a 305c, and because we‚Äôre selling the more valuable contract (the lower the strike price the more valuable the call), we get a net credit instead of a net debit, meaning we receive money in our account rather than pay it. That means just like when we short a stock, to close the position we need to pay money rather than receive it. With a call credit spread, we‚Äôre now betting against the market: If SPY stays below $300 on 6/3, the credit we received when we sold spread stays ours forever since both the 300c we sold and the 305c we bought expired worthless. You‚Äôre still betting on the spread between the two option prices, but now you‚Äôre betting on the differences between the two going to 0 rather than the maximum. Now, if the position moves against us and SPY finishes above $305 on 6/3, our SPY 300c we sold will exercise and we will pay for those 100 shares with our 100 shares we receive from our 305c, meaning that we pay at maximum $500. **NOTE**: Robinhood will hold the maximum you can lose as collateral just in case your trade goes poorly, so if you receive a credit of $65 on the trade, you‚Äôll effectively have another $435 locked up until you close the trade.


Until now I have assumed that the underlying stock price will always finish outside of the range of your spread which has made things a little cleaner. In reality, if you should choose to hold until expiration and the underlying price is between the two strikes, one of your options will exercise and the other will expire worthless. For example, if on 6/3 SPY ended at $303, for our SPY 6/3 305/300 Debit Spread our 300c would exercise and we would have 100 shares of SPY purchased at $300, netting us $3 per share. Considering that most people in this sub could not handle a purchase of 100 shares of SPY at $300, Robinhood will exercise your spread an hour before close at market prices (which is why I will always sell before this point since you can do a lot better than market prices most of the time). 

**Basics Summary**

Thus ends the basic portion of the write up. The benefits of vertical spreads are:

- *Defined risk just like calls and puts*
- *Much simpler to conceptualize profitable scenarios*
- *Requires less capital than calls and puts in cases where share prices are high (TSLA and AMZN). This is due to the fact that you‚Äôre playing the difference between option prices and not the ability to sell 100 shares of the underlying.*

Options Profit Calculator is a very useful resource for learning not only vertical spreads but any options and I highly recommend playing around with it if you‚Äôre new to options: https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/ 

**Details and Tips**


- **Liquidity**: Spreads are inherently less liquid than single options since it's twice as many transactions (even if it doesn‚Äôt seem like it since you‚Äôre paying for it all at once). You‚Äôll find that until single options, it is more difficult to get prices that are in the midpoint of the bid-ask spread, meaning you‚Äôll have to pay more for debit spreads and get less credit in credit spreads when opening the positions and vice versa when closing the position. What this means is that it is important to trade options that have high volume, and as a result, low bid-ask spreads. I‚Äôve been burned in the past by purchasing PLNT spreads and losing $100 when purchasing and selling, so I stick to highly traded securities such as SPY, DIS, AAPL, BA, etc. I also always trade on $5 increments when I can help it, since $5 increments are nearly always more liquid than any other strike.
- **Risk and Reward**: There are a lot of knobs to play with if you want more or less risky spreads. Clearly the further OTM your spread is the less you‚Äôre paying for that spread and the higher the reward is, which also goes for ITM being more costly as less reward. Wider spreads between the two strikes gives you a larger zone of ‚Äúmedium‚Äù rewards whereas tighter spreads create a more all-or-nothing reward structure. I don‚Äôt have too much more to say here, if you want to know more about this, play with Options Profit Calculator linked above. 
- **Impact of Implied Volatility**: One of the chief benefits of vertical spreads is that we‚Äôre avoiding the largest effects of changes in IV since it hits both the leg that we are long as well as the leg we are short. IV still impacts spreads though, since increases in IV cause spreads to increase due to larger expected moves, and contractions in IV cause decreases in IV for opposite reasons. All this means is that *we want to use Debit Spreads when we expect IV to increase and Credit Spreads when we expect it to decrease.*
- **Theta**: You‚Äôll hear a lot about people saying that theta works for you in a credit spread and against you in a debit spread. This is technically true, since as theta causes option values to tick down, spreads tighten by nature. In reality though, theta only really hurts your debit spreads when they are OTM. Believe me, you‚Äôll still be feeling the theta burn if your credit spread is OTM as you watch your 5/15 SPY 300/305 Put Credit Spread become less and less likely to be ITM. It‚Äôs one of the reasons why Iron Condors are set up with two credit spreads, one capping the range and one creating a floor: You want theta to be working for you in both cases (since both are ITM). 
- **Uneven Payouts**: I couldn‚Äôt find a better term to use for this, but you‚Äôll find that especially for underlyings that have significant upward expectations, you‚Äôll get ‚Äúmore value‚Äù out of betting on a downward move. For example, for a SPY 290/280 Call Debit Spread, [you‚Äôll pay $6.24 even though SPY nearly right in the middle after closing at $284.97.](https://imgur.com/s1VS9TA) If there was no expectation of upward movement we would find that a $10 strike debit spread perfectly centered on the current price would cost $5.00, but that is not the case. This spread functions as an interesting indicator of current market sentiment, but it functions more as a lagging indicator than a leading one, which means that betting on upward moves is much more cost effective after a large drop (such as if you‚Äôd made bullish bets during the drop over the past few days). 
- **Entering a Position**: I‚Äôve found that two things hurt me when I‚Äôm entering a position: Giving up too much value when picking a bid, and being too patient in filling my bid. Robinhood is pretty shit at showing you the actual bid-ask spread for a vertical spread, so I like to start bidding at slightly lower than the midpoint of the bid-ask and slowly canceling and reordering the position, upping the purchasing point each time I do. This way I don‚Äôt accidentally lose $20 of value by accepting a worse ask than I needed to while also not giving my position time to move while I‚Äôm not in it yet. Spreads are surprisingly frustrating to enter when you‚Äôre inexperienced, and I‚Äôve certainly given up a thousand or two in fucked up entrances over the past few months. My advice would be to not skimp on planning your entrance.
- **When to Close Position**: I dislike holding my winning plays until expiration for multiple reasons. When the underlying finishes between the strikes of your spread, you end up exposed to pin risk as you can‚Äôt sell out of your long/short position until the market opens. I personally also don‚Äôt like having the risk that a sudden change in the underlying can cause a winning position to suddenly shift into a losing one, so I usually don‚Äôt look for more than 95% gains on a single position and exit out once that has been achieved. 
- **Iron Condors**: The only strategy I‚Äôll talk about other than vertical spreads in this writeup since they‚Äôre also fairly basic in execution. Iron Condors involve two credit spreads: A call credit spread which forms a cap and a put credit spread which forms a floor. With an Iron Condor you‚Äôre betting that the underlying will expire between the two spreads. For example, I currently hold a 6/19 275-300 Iron Condor that consists of a 270/275 Put Credit Spread and a 300/305 Call Credit Spread. While the idea here is basic, realistically you‚Äôre not holding an Iron Condor to expiration every time, so it's important to experiment with how the value of an Iron Condor valuation changes as it matures. Taking a look at a [theta decay curve](https://imgur.com/8DokBpg) will show you where you should expect most of the value to come from. The another big Greek to consider for an Iron Condor is Delta. The delta of an Iron Condor is determined by simply adding the delta of each position within the Iron Condor (short positions are negative delta). Since the expectation for SPY is that the underlying will go up over time, a zero delta Iron Condor (hedged against price movements at time of purchase) will be significantly lower than the midpoint between the two spreads of the IC. I personally like a bit of negative delta in this environment since you end up making money when the underlying decreases and IV increases due to delta, and you also make money when the underlying increases and IV decreases. One last thing to consider when opening and closing an Iron Condor is that it is purchasing two spreads at once, which means that it requires even more liquidity than spreads do to trade profitably. Since you have to buy these so close to the ask and sell so close to the bid, Iron Condors work much better as trades to hold over a period of at least a week. This isn't to say I haven't bought and sold an Iron Condor over a one day stretch, but its certainly not optimal. 


Alright this got a bit long, and there's more to talk about, but I‚Äôll stop here. **DISCLAIMER**: Now that you‚Äôve read this post, I'll admit I‚Äôve only been actively trading for about three months. I just finished a Finance undergrad and I've been investing unsuccessfully for five years until this point where [I‚Äôm finally up about 100%](https://imgur.com/whk4Jgp) from when I started over something silly like 100 trades. I‚Äôm not gonna post all of my past positions, but [my current positions can be found here.](https://imgur.com/lGu32tP) Suffice to say that I made a ton off bearish spreads and it was a rude reeducation that made me learn it was necessary to play both sides of the market.


**TL;DR**: Spreads are easier to conceptualize, don‚Äôt worry as much about IV and theta, have defined risk, and require less capital than puts/calls. ***An easy way to view a SPY 6/3 305/300 Call Debit Spread is then that you‚Äôre betting $65 to win $500 as long as SPY ends above $305 on 6/3.***",0.0,2020-05-15,1

Boeing (BA) & Spirit Aerosystems (SPR) in for downside exposure on 737 MAX. Puts Away,64,egxcqg,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/egxcqg/boeing_ba_spirit_aerosystems_spr_in_for_downside/,51,2019-12-29 04:02:08,"Hey WSB,

First time poster. As a wannabe autist, I feel that I have come across an opportunity and wanted to share my thoughts with my fellow degenerates on a trade I'm embarking on. Feel free to shit this down. Full disclosure: if it is not obvious as your read, I am not an expert, lose with me at your own risk!

**Headline:** I believe the 737 MAX crisis is being underplayed by Boeing and are about to be exposed in the market coming towards Q4 earnings on  Jan 29. 

**Short Background:** So everyone who reads the news (so noone on this reddit) has heard about the two 737 MAX crashes, plane groundings, etc. when it comes to Boeing. What is weird, is how well the stock of Boeing done since October 29th 2018 (1st crash ) through today. 

&#x200B;

[BA from October 2018 to today](https://preview.redd.it/uvoevd530g741.png?width=2478&format=png&auto=webp&s=655b08b0fc899131ff16761bdf5d62cf44c604ff)

**Long Background:**

After the first crash, the stock dropped from $360->$330 and mostly recovered within a handful of days. And really, and why shouldn't it? The MAX was a brand new plane, but pilots make mistakes and it didn't make sense to see it as a major risk to BA stock.

Then on May 3rd, 2019 (2nd arrow on chart), another brand new MAX went down in the same way. I'm not an aviation expert in anyway but lightning doesn't strike the same spot twice.  The stock dropped over the next week $370->$335 and Boeing has been in this approximate channel until today. I'm not a technical trading expert so there will be no attempt to baffle you with technical bullshit here when it comes to the stock price.

 However, there is one major difference this time around when the 2nd crash that happened. All the MAXes were grounded. Now the stock has had movement in prices but in large part it appears the market has behaved like this is not a big deal and Boeing has sold it to be this way. You can see in the buildup and around earnings in Q2 and Q3 some huge movements due to the uncertainty around the grounding of this fleet. But Boeing was able to reassure shareholders, customers and everyone else that they would quickly resolve these issues and get the birds up in the air ASAP. 

Most importantly, Boeing kept production going full steam ahead saying the the MAX's would be flying again in early Q4 as late as the October 23rd at their Q3 Earnings. Yea, none of the has happened. Now again, I'm not an aviation expert, but I have been watching a lot of youtube of Boeing pilots putting their 2 cents on this. As I see it, its not that there is any one major aspect of the MAX that led to the critical failures, but a systematic approach of half ass problem solving over a long period of timing finally catching up with Boeing. The issues for these planes appears to be system errors that Boeing identified and trained their pilots to get around, instead of solving the root of the error within their systems. While getting around the issue for the trained pilot is not a problem, if sequences of these errors happen systematically, it is possible for even a trained pilot to make errors. 

At this point I think it's important to bring up another key stakeholder here, the FAA. The FAA was one of the last aviating authorities to ground the MAX around the world, not the best look. In a nutshell, the FAA has been fucking cozy with Boeing, and it became very obvious after this second crash. Boeing has been pushing the FAA ever since using this too big to fail attitude which looks to be backfiring. It seems that the FAA needs to build its trust with the public and they need to show they can keep face. Coming back to the system errors, I think that fixing one small issue with the MAX is not the problem, its an attitude issue that now you cant just teach pilots work arounds, you need to solve these problems. By the way, the FAA is going to be up your ass the whole way now. 

As the MAX grounding wears on, Boeing kept making 52 a month at an average cost of around 115 million a bird, piling up in inventory. Now it's over 400 birds they cannot deliver as they are not certified to fly. About a week ago, Boeing and SPR announced production will not start after the holiday break. This is going to be a major problem for Boeing, and possibly even more severe for key supplier Spirit Aerosystems SPR. The MAX is good for about 35% of all of Boeings business and about 50% for Spirit. Boeing has been hardselling the MAX's would be in the air soon, but they are not. United Airlines is calling bullshit on Boeing and not scheduling any MAX's until June 2020. 

**The Play:** I cannot predict how long this grounding will last but, based on all of these issues that don't line up with what management is saying, I really believe Boeing is going to have some bad news to drop at Q4 earnings and the bleeding will get worse until the news drops. If the production halt last 6 months, that is around 20% of their projected revenue for 2020 gone. Not to mention a huge amount of costs associated with getting the planes certified to fly again. They are in line for a huge hit in their cash flow and profitability in for some time. While I dont know how long this will last, I bet Boeing is in for a bad Q4, and most likely a horrible 2020 that they will not be able to spin. 

This is the opportunity. This stock has been trading like management at Boeing has solved the problem. I don't believe them. It will be interesting to see what direction the new CEO will take the ship.

**Bets:** 

**BA**

* 5 Puts at 310-1.08 entry
* 18 Puts at 295-0.32 entry

expiring Jan 10.

**SPR**

* 6 Puts 72.50-1.44 entry

expiring Jan 17.

You may be asking yourself, ''Didnt this autist say BA earnings is on Jan 29th, why buy puts expiring the 10/17th??'' You would be right, I cant help myself. Like a fly is drawn to turds I love cheap FD's. I am banking on leaking news, layoffs at Boeing and SPR, and guidance before earnings throws these stocks into an uncertainty free fall outside its trading channels below 330 and possibly a lot lower. If you check the 2017 Boeing trading before MAX production, it was around $150 share. Once again, I am not a technical expert but it seems like there is a fuck load of room for these stocks to go down for the bad news on Q4 and 2020 guidance. 

**Risks:** There is no shortage of risks, but I am firmly in the camp that Boeing has only bad news to announce from now to earnings, this of course could be wrong. That being said, the other risk I see with Both BA and SPR are fairly close to 52 week lows while the DJ and SP 500 are at record highs which means every chump and GUH  savant is looking at these oversold stocks and buying Calls as they look cheap. Any semi-positive news will send these savants into a frenzy and put a huge fucking wrench on these risky trades. 

**Conclusion:** I see 3 outcomes in the next 2 weeks.   
1. BA and SPR bottom out and trade flat/shoot up on some positive news. Either way, I'm out about 2 grand autistically believing I knew what is going on and life moves on.  
2. They slip another 4%-8% in the next 2 weeks. If they continue bleeding coming to earnings like BA did preluding into Q3 earnings where they dropped $50 a share in a few days. This could give a nice opportunity to cash in handsomely and exchange for more puts that expire after earnings. (Which I should've originally done)  
3. News leaks or guidance that impacts revenue, costs and profitability and Boeing and SPR cakes its pants. 10-20% drop and I can contemplate quitting my day job.

I‚Äôll try to dumb it down for you fuck tards.",974,lttzpt,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lttzpt/dear_apes_why_was_rockets_dividend_strategy/,419,2021-02-27 23:48:41,"Happy Saturday Tards. Oh and a heart-felt go fuck yourself to the WSB mods! Ban me again you cunts, I don‚Äôt care ü•∞

Apes, lmk if I am missing anything with this thesis:

When I first heard RKT was doing a dividend I was pissed - no true growth companies pay out dividends. It‚Äôs for boomer companies like XOM or CVX. But this one-time special dividend  is VASTLY different. Why? Well strap on your helmet and kneebow pads and I‚Äôll tell you fece-tossing apes.

RKT insiders own 95% of $RKT shares. So 95% of the dividend payout is going to Rocket insiders (75% of which is owned by Dan Gilbert, the reincarnation of King Haramabe himself). 

$RKT insiders are literally paying themselves; they can use the cash they pay themselves to buy-back stock while forcing shorts to pay a dividend and enticing investors to buy in simultaneously. If you tree-swinging Orangutans didn‚Äôt already know, Rocket attempted to deter shorts during November‚Äôs earnings call by adding a $1 billion dollar buy back. 

It didn‚Äôt work. Shorts only continued to pile in, but here‚Äôs the thing. Rocket hasn‚Äôt used a PENNY of that buyback. They are still fully loaded with ammunition to fuck over the shorts with a billion dollars to buy back shares.  $1B buyback is OVER HALF OF THEIR PUBLIC FLOAT. 

**Shorts have to pay the dividend?**

Yes. If a stock in which you currently have a short position pays a dividend, you are responsible for the dividend on the shares you have borrowed. When the dividend is due, your broker will withdraw cash from your brokerage account equal to the amount of the dividend paid on the shorted shares.


**BuT iF RkT Is So UnDeRvALuEd, WhY HaVeN‚ÄôT tHeY BoUgHt BaCk AnY ShArEs ?**

GREAT QUESTION my jello-brained friend, now wipe the drool off the side of your mouth and I‚Äôll tell you. 

The reason Rocket hasn‚Äôt bought back any shares is because, companies are unable to exercise a buy back if they are holding non-public, material information(their new partnership with Etrade and Morgan Stanley AND the special dividend announcement). I assumed before the ER that they hadn‚Äôt bought back any shares for this reason and still believe it to be true. Now that the partner and dividend announcement is behind them, the $RKT can fire at will and is clear for take off üöÄüöÄüöÄ

Rocket insiders will receive $2B from the special dividend which is more than enough to cover the buy back plan they announced back in November. 

Initially, I wanted an increase in the amount of buy back but then I realized that the special dividend may be one of the smartest moves they could make. This move is very calculated - it may complement their buy back strategy tremendously, force shorts to pay more money on top of the 80% interest they are paying to borrow shares, and also motivate retards like you to ditch GME and buy a real winner. Not to mention Rocket was already a popular stock among option traders but its share volume was low. This FAT dividend will motivate more investors to choose shares rather than options, which will help increase our chances of a breakout on volume. 

**BuT YoU CaNt SqUeEzE a 40 BiLlIoN DoLlAR CoMpAnY:**

Don‚Äôt focus on the size of the company. Focus on the size of their public float. Which makes them a FUBO sized company in a sense, and they are a company that is actually sustainable and will continue growing. We all know how GameStop‚Äôs ending will be written. Patient GME shorts will end up making money because GME will eventually fall back to its worth/value. But Rocket is different. When Rocket hits the $30s, it will never see the $20s again. There is nothing for shorts to ‚Äúwait out‚Äù on this play. I‚Äôm not gay, but I am down to fuck some shorts in the ass, now who‚Äôs with me?



TLDR: dividend and buy back plan = more üí¥ for more ü¶ç. More üí∞ = more üçå. Apes likey bananas üçå

This reduction in staff may seem to be a significant negative for Boeing and indeed, is a large negative for the short-term investor. However, in the long-term, this layoff (in combination with voluntary layoffs last month) will allow Boeing to emerge from this downturn as a more efficient company as the company focuses on profits during this difficult time.

Also, last week, we learned that Boeing had reached a significant milestone regarding the over a yearlong 737 MAX grounding as they resumed aircraft production. Boeing has begun production of this aircraft, albeit at a shallow rate, focusing on methodologies to enhance quality and plans to ramp production this year. As the 737 MAX is a significant source of revenue and profit for Boeing, the resumption of production is a sign that recertification is on the horizon.

Over the last two days, the stock has seen substantial gains driven by news that airlines are finally on the upswing as more people are flying in comparison to the lows reached last month. However, even in light of substantial gains, the stock remains 40% off pre-corona highs, and over 50% from all-time highs reached in mid-2019. With Boeing gaining $25 billion from one of the most extensive debt offerings in history, they will have access to plenty of funds to withstand this downturn with no government aid.

As production of the 737 MAX continues, and Boeing becomes more efficient from an employment perspective, Boeing is positioned to become even more valuable than before this pandemic. Global air travel has increased dramatically over the last 15 years with no end in sight.

4. Airlines are extending cancellation on all 737 Max flights until July, looking like it's going to cost $BA at least another $6B.

I picked up some 310/315 Puts for 1/31 if you're a true autist the 300 for 1/31 also looking mighty fine.

Boeing 737 MAX just got approved by EU regulation today as safe to fly again. Now if you go look at the options chain volume, mainly for 11/20 170c, you can see huge fukin volume this past week, especially today (16k contracts) with big blocks of buys (seen on my options tracker). I think you get the point. FAA approval is next, and big dogs already know it's coming.

May tendies rain all upon us true autists.
