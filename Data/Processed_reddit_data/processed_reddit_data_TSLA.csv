Who thinks TSLA is going to miss earnings because cars are stored everywhere. ,1868,1fnzywr,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1fnzywr/who_thinks_tsla_is_going_to_miss_earnings_because/,872,2024-09-24 06:07:13,"TSLA is having an enormous problem. First off I live in Austin and I drive by the plant every once in a while. They have cars stacked 4 and 5 high, looks like almost a 1,000 if not more. Cybertrucks too. They have finally caught up to demand and now have way too much supply. The CyberTruck is a dud. I canceled my order, so did everyone else I know. The Model Y and 3 seem to sell well but I rarely see a new model X or Y. So the high end has stopped moving. Plus they have lowered the prices so much they have destroyed the high margins they were making. Plaid has gone from almost $140k to less than $100k. That’s a lot of profit gone. Tesla dealerships have them stored to the Moon. Same thing cars stacked 4 and 5 high and parked all over the place. At other Dealerships I am being told by friends who live in other parts of the Country that it’s worse. 

The entire car industry is having massive issues but Ford and GM are not valued at 60xs forward earnings. 

I think Elon is going to try to preempt the Earnings disaster with his “RoboTaxi” announcement on the 10th. 1 week before earnings on the 16th. Try to ride the “AI” hype. 

Power-walls don’t sell, Solar does not pencil out, and they are not building a robot anytime soon.

But they still can’t make my dam Roadster, been on order for 4 years plus. 

Me thinking of taking out a nice Put position for the 16th. Short term Puts will be cheap and stock has rallied back over $250. Perfect timing to knock $50 bucks off the stock. 

That’s what happened last time.

Thoughts WSB wizards?

TSLA Puts, out of the Money, for the Win?

Tesla sales are down, and I think they will keep falling. There’s no EV winter, Ford etc. are doing fine. People are buying EVs, just not Teslas.

2. Leadership. Musk has spread himself too thinly. Spends his days tweeting random conspiracies, aside from running idk how many side companies. Seems he has shiny object syndrome and clearly the attention isn’t on Tesla right now.

3. Competition. Chinese EVs are better. Cheaper. He said it himself. Americans will eventually catch on and shift to those. 

4. Regulations. Trump gets elected, he will favor fuel/hybrids. He could’ve made Biden-Harris his allies as they clearly care more about climate change, EV stuff - but he’s alienated them more than ever. 

He’s also alienated his core customer base (climate conscious left-wing folks, right wing folks mostly think EVs are gay)

5. His public (mis)behavior. Going on full jousts with the biggest western governments while cozying up with the dictatorships (Saudi, Turkey) won’t serve him. His lack of content moderation and refusal to cooperate with the world’s largest govs can cost him big. See Pavel Durov’s current situation. 

6. Stock price. Tesla is overbought. Has been for a while. Was fine when it was seen as the highest growth EV contender, but its subsiding with competition. He’s been pushing for it to be valued as an AI company but it’s not happening. The $56bn payout that was just approved shows he probably thought that money was more productive out the company versus reinvested.

7. X is bleeding cash. He’ll probably sell some $TSLA stock to reinject money into it since he’s not letting it go bankrupt and most likely won’t sell it either.

Based on the above. I call a top.

This is after the price cuts, low interest rate offerings, and discounts. Demand just isn’t there and they do not have enough time to turn things around.


Margins keep getting tighter and tighter, falling to levels similar to other automotive companies. “But but FSD and robotaxi”. FSD hasn’t had the perceived success they thought it would have - people just like driving their cars and the extra value isn’t there for the normal person. Robotaxi won’t be ready this year, I’d be surprised if it’s ready next year - this is the most obvious sell the news out there, especially based on Tesla’s track record of over-promising and hyping things up. 


They currently have nothing in their financials but “hope” that signals a turnaround. Fundamentals clearly show TSLA is overpriced and I expect a tank in the near term. Oh and once the Delaware judge validates the attorney fees Tesla will have to pay those attorneys in billions worth of options which will almost assuredly be sold. Good luck to TSLA bulls but things aren’t looking good.

Sup, honorable apecitizens! Recently I’ve been working on this fascinating piece of TA, and now I am finally ready to share that with [you](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/msv8n1/tbh_i_only_trust_retards/). I am so confident in it, that I dared to put my beard (which I have for five years already) on the line! Worth your full read, I promise! I decided to structure the analysis in the following way: first we'll take a look at the VW short squeeze, revisiting its origins and background as the very first step of the discussion - in order to better understand the fundamental context of TA; after that I'll lay down the main technical parameters and frameworks, through which the [GMESS](https://imgur.com/a/Sd4uE1b) thesis will be dissected, applying all of those to VWSS and explaining the TA core on the Volkswagen example; then, the process will be repeated, but this time TSLASS anatomy will be elaborated upon. Finally, all of the data accumulated in the process, as well as the major findings made, will be applied to the current technical state of GME, in order to construct at least a potential forecast and the probable price action. Buckle up and eat a crayon, let's start.

Oh, and one more thing! I really encourage you to dive deep into the ANALysis with me, because the thesis can only be understood if all of the technical factors at play are considered in the sharpest detail first - and then in the aggregate: zooming out and looking at the bigger picture through the prism of coincidences, interdependences and probabilities. Dafaq did I just write? - Dunno, but that's exactly what I meant!

# Volkswagen - Das Short-Squeeze: Sep 2007 - Mar 2009

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Remember, when VW became the most valued company in the world for a brief wild period of trading? I bet, Pepperidge apes remember. The squeeze played out right in the midst of the global financial crisis, and such an occurrence was fueled by a curious background scenario, orchestrated largely by one very interesting person. Back then, the former President of Porsche, Wendelin Wiedeking (must be a cousin of Battlefield Counterstrike), was pursuing a goal of taking over Volkswagen. In this process, he used cash-settled options to circumvent the transparency and disclosure of Porsche’s market operations. While being acquired by Porsche, Volkswagen had its ordinary shares premium risen to disproportionately high levels compared to its preference shares.

As the general public was finding out about Wendysking’s takeover plan, hedge funds and particularly short-sellers set their eyes on the fact that Volkswagen’s preferred shares were traded at a significant discount to the ordinaries (approximately 70%). While the price of the ordinary stock gradually increased, the preferential shares stayed put - and the hedge funds smelt an arbitrage opportunity. They started shorting the stock and buying the preferred shares to profit on the massive divergence. For a moment, there was no news of Porsche continuing its purchase of VW ordinaries from the market, and that fact gave the hedge funds additional confidence. Only to get blindsided, as it turned out later. One shorts-frying weekend, Porsche announced its total holding in VW, cornering the substantial part of the float, and leaving only 6% in free float. In the meantime, short sales had risen to 12% of total stock outstanding. When the market found out that Porsche had acquired 74.1% of the outstanding shares through the in-transparent cash-settled options, VWSS happened - briefly making Volkswagen the largest company in the world, and finally allowing the shorting side to [GUH](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dpnzup/i_recorded_todays_marketopen_and_the_instant/):

&#x200B;

>It was mathematically impossible for every short-seller to buy a share, and therefore close their position. In other words, half the room were going to be left in a burning building with no way out. A panicked dash for the exit began.

&#x200B;

— A spot on metaphor by Jamie Powell, an FT journalist. Hedge funds are estimated to have lost $20 to $30 billion by betting against VW ordinary stock.

What is really ironic (in Palpatine voice) - even though Porsche managed to burn many short sellers, the company couldn’t pay up for the huge positions it had created, and ended up being acquired by VW instead.

Also, interestingly enough, after his departure from Porsche, Wiedeking was charged with market manipulation for his role in the takeover bid. The charges were dropped in July 2016 due to a too little chance of success. Lucking Fegend.

&#x200B;

**Now let’s take a look at how this epic event was incorporated into the chart:**

[VWSS, Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/d3pfzvb202z61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e497ddf6518faec188269120c44df64ab6cb1791)

Even though it all looks overwhelming from the first glance, don't worry, I'll explain. There are only two major TA instruments used here, namely Fibonacci retracement 🌈tool (useful for assessing 'altitude' and the crucial support/resistance levels, check out the in-depth explanation of this TA tool [in my other post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mwevzz/the_big_short_20_why_bears_may_soon_reconsider/)). The second one is the trend based Fibonacci extension for time periods (pink vertical grid with numbers 0, 0.382, 0.618 and so on) - for setting the major time landmarks and zones. Furthermore, you should have noticed the three catchy geometric figures, and the purple line - which is actually a good starting point to unfold the technical thesis.

In the process of working with VW, TSLA and GME charts, I managed to identify several peculiar characteristics and patterns, that were of an evident nature and have been manifested on all of the three charts, to one degree or another. The most prominent one, in my opinion, is the killer purple resistance/support level. For the current VW example, it is somewhere around $30 mark, or $29.27 if you like precision.

One may observe on the chart above, that this level is indeed the most significant level through the complete history of VWSS. First, the preliminary to the squeeze major bull run, which solidly accelerated in the middle of September 2007, was held back and repulsed by this level's resistance on the last day of October. It took almost half a year for the price action to catch up to it again in late March 2008. This was followed by a consolidation (with several failed attempts of breakout) just below this level, which lasted for more than 100 days, before the price action finally torn the resistance apart with the powerful gap on the 16th of July '08. And guess what? Even after that, the level played the major supportive role for the price action, with one final retest before the squeeze finally lift off it in the middle of September 2008. You should also make a note of how the price was still magnetized by this level during the final stages of the squeeze. The signifficance of this price level for the whole chart of VW above is difficult to underestimate. Seeing the importance of this level and being a fan of Jimi Hendrix, I decided to name it ""**Purple Haze**"".

Let's inspect the fancy geometric shapes now. These are actually much more reasoned and circumspective than it may seem from the first glance. The first one, in orange, is a cup shaped consolidation (let it be called the ""**Squeezy Grail**"", because why not?) - taking place above 100% Fibo and just below the 'Purple Haze'  - which commenced as soon as this major resistance level had been tested for the first time. It is subsequently followed by the second consolidation of a flatter nature \[if you know what else is of a flatter nature, comment and if the joke is good enough I may give you an award\], which again plays around the main $30 level on the chart. The second consolidation, highlighted by the pink rectangle (a.k.a. the ""**Runway**""), is actually more important than the first one, because here is the point where the paramount breakout happens: the 'Purple Haze' resistance is blew off (in the middle of 0.382 period). Based on that observation, it is also appropriate to assume that in order for the squeeze to initiate, the 'Purple Haze' has to be conquered at some point inside 0.382 Fibo time zone, during the 'Runway' stage. Finally, the triangular ""**Squieezluminati Confirmed**"" part is self explanatory, imho. Oh, just one commentary worth being made here: take a look at how the squeeze itself is proportionate, bipartite, and fits well into the isosceles triangle. The nature surely knows how to play with stonks, too.

Especially, when we talk about Fibonacci. The horizontal 🌈 grid, Fibo retracement, is often used to estimate the possible corrective trend's depth, as well as to identify the key support and resistance levels of it. This one is comfortably applied to the beninging and the apex point of the trend (see the gray dash and dash line on the chart above), and its relevance is subsequently confirmed by how the price action plays around the levels in the triangle. The 12th of September '07 seems to be a good starting point for Fibo retracement application, because on that day another important resistance of $20.72 was penetrated for the first time (then confirmed as support with the beautiful bear trap candle on 23 Jan '08). Furthermore, $20.72 level works like an ideal 100% Fibo retrace level for the current example, and supports the 'Holy Grail' comparable to how my granny supports me. Also, take a note of the 'Purple Haze' being relatively in the middle, in between 78.6% and 100% of Fibo retracement - an important factor that will enable us to apply this retracement to GME later.

Not only the 12th of September fits well as Fibo retracement starting point, it is also a perfect spot to start stretching out the trend-based Fib time grid (TBFTG - to be fucked then go, alternatively). This one is a complex instrument, so take this quick explanation for granted or do your own research in relation to it. Just like Fibo retracement, TBFTG is based on Fibonacci sequence, but this one applies to time periods, instead of the price action and levels. In order to use this instrument properly, it is necessary to identify the preliminary major trend, that will serve as the core measurement for the sequent time periods. Oh, it took me a lot of time to inspect that parameter and to identify those initial pink dash and dash trends, trust me! Tbh, it was one of the most difficult tasks to accomplish in the preparation of this TA. But the result was worth the effort! I noticed the following correlation applicable to both VWSS and TSLASS (and hypothetically to GME too): TBFTG pink dash measurement must involve the major preliminary impulse of the prior main trend, plus 'Squeezy Grail' phase. The staring point of TBFTG is particularly tricky to be identified, and I'm talking about all of the examples, but possible - especially when looking at the TA as a whole, referring to how the grid applies to the price action, and comparing the examples between each other. That is pure rocket science, if you ask me. And most importantly, the TBFTG measurement duration (pink dash and dash trend) seem to be very similar in length to 'Squieezluminati' basis - check the bars measurements on all of the charts (blue lines for VW).

Pay attention to the following features, which really help to dissect the squeezes' anatomies and to build the suitable technical framework: *the 'Purple Haze' breakout occurs in 0.382 TBFTG zone; and the squeeze lifts off in the first half of 0.618 zone, peaking at 1*; *TBFTG pink dash measurement includes major preliminary trend plus 'Squeezy Grail', as it has been mentioned above. Furthermore, the correlation in duration of TBFTG measurement and the triangle basis must once again be emphasized.*

Noice, but let's move further.

# Tesla, or how Elon Mask truly “is become meme, Destroyer of shorts”: Apr 2019 - Apr 2020

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Tesla and the founder Elon Musk have confronted the short sellers on a regular basis, and even after the run-ins with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), for now, the former have been winning. The TSLA shorters were sitting on mark-to-market losses of over $40 billion in late 2020, as the company’s shares exploded 740% last year. This information is based on data collected by Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners, a fin-anal company.

Remember the not so distant in past Tesla 'mania'? The prospects of Tesla’s business and the furious opposition of bulls and bears, including famous fund managers like David Einhorn and Mark Spiegel (who still hold a strong opinion that TSLA is a house of cards ready to collapse), have over the years contributed to an extreme volatility in the stock price. Elon Musk openly criticized the short-sellers and their motivation to dig out and spread negative sentiment about the company. The 'taking Tesla private' play seemed to work out for the short-sellers as the stock price collapsed by about 50% from November 2018 to May 2019. After that, amidst Tesla’s opening of the Shanghai Gigafactory and the announcement of the company's first annual operating profit exceeding analyst expectations, the tables have turned and the bear-beaten TSLA shares skyrocketed in price (not without noble WSBetters help, definitely). Needless to say, that previously steady short-sellers started getting anxious and scrambled to cover their positions.

&#x200B;

Dusaniwsky told Institutional Investor (B2B media) that shorting Tesla is:

>The longest unprofitable short I’ve ever seen!

&#x200B;

Well, Mr. Dusaniwsky, WSB seem to have an answer for everything:

https://preview.redd.it/h3l5hayu02z61.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ecc69df97a282c4a22663e8487cf316488ed9d32

&#x200B;

While companies and founders often hold a scorn on short sellers, because they can bring down stock prices and cause the cost of capital to rise (or even do worse things, if you know what I mean), Musk’s disdain for the short selling community is unrivaled. In the middle of 2020, Musk took a dig at short sellers by releasing 'short shorts'. These now sell at a premium on Ebay. It's all nice and good, but I have another cool merch idea - '**shortz r fuk**':

[TSLASS, Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/f0qbrpqn22z61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=479c78e6763043f81e9ac2c75cf8a6c769d9eee4)

&#x200B;

Beautiful, isn't it? Let's quickly run through the short squeeze anatomy checklist, thoroughly elaborated in the previous TA chapter via the example of VW. First things first, the 'Squeezy Grail' is present, but it resembles more of a V shape structure. Next, the 'Runway' stage is good-looking: a fucking massive gap happened there, and this time 78.6% Fibo level is tested during the 'Runway', being indicative of the TSLA bulls' crazy power. 'Squieezluminati Confirmed' is also really interesting here, as this time there is no isosceles triangle at its core structure, but rather a 'chainsaw'-like volatile price action taking place. Furthermore, you may see that inside of the triangle, there is the after-peak 78.6% Fibo zone retest, which in turn hedl and bounced the price back in the direction of... Moon. Blessed be the bulls!

Looking at the 'Purple Haze' (which is again in between Fibo 78.6% and 100% \[important!\]), for TSLASS the major price level manifested at $52.46. During the first half of 2019, this level played a role of a magnetizing support, with the subsequent testing in March and the breakout to the downside in late April. Again, a lengthy, half a year long consolidation is taking place just below this level, and above Fibo 100% retracement. The breakout occurs, you guessed, right in the TBFTG 0.382 zone. And what is really fascinating, is the fact that, after the breakout, the 'Purple Haze' has never been retested. But who knows what the future holds?

And the Fibos. The retracement, again, apples perfectly onto the complete squeeze structure: 78.6% is trialed several times; all of the upper levels except for 38.2% were broken with the subsequent retrace and and some with the retest. A particularly intensive price action was occurring for about two weeks near the 23.6% Fibo level, and the high of $189.4 level was penetrated and then touched gently during the initial squeeze. Ah, almost forgot, 100% ($35.75) Fibo level firmly holds the 'Squeezy Grail' in hand again.

Current TBFTG should be of an interest for fellow TAnaLyzators too. Particularly, the downtrend, as opposed to VW uptrend, serves as the core for TBFTG's application (again, refer to the dash and dash pinkish line). This core is composed of the pre-'Squeezy Grail' downtrend plus the Grail itself. Take a look at gray measurements, which cover this phase and the triangle duration - again these two follow the tendency of being proportionate in the length as phases. *Crucially, the 'Purple Haze' breakout occurs in 0.382 TBFTG zone again; then one more time the squeeze lifts off in the first half of 0.618 zone, with the false first peak during the final stages of 0.618 and the proper peak at 1*.

Too many coincidences and congruences between the two TA examples discussed above, if you ask me. Especially if the fact that such events happen once in ten years or so is taken into account. Two quotes are of a relevance here:

&#x200B;

>Coincidences mean you're on the right path - *Simon van Booy*

&#x200B;

>If you gaze long enough into an asshole, the asshole will gaze back into you - u/roman_axt

&#x200B;

Some additional food for thought from TSLA:

[For redditors with a different floor](https://preview.redd.it/gnd0yienc2z61.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b8b72e1671ad69cf871cde154ae386e52835e94a)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# Game stopped, or it is just a beginning?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I am absolutely confident that you all know even more than myself about the fundamental factors at play for GME, so I will not bother you here with the background explanation. There is a plenty of good HQ DD all around reddit, so let's jump straight to the sweet sweet TA:

[GMESS, Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/ko1ppnasc2z61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1d3f7c2a78135696d66a0a70e8e2a34ad4a04dbf)

&#x200B;

At this point, I feel that a disclaimer is necessary. Let me briefly remind you that this analysis is a thesis, or a hypothesis that has to be proven in the future. I do believe that there is a solid probability for things to play out this way, and my beard supports my manly confidence. However, this is the market, and it all may go another way at any point in time, that's the nature of things! Think critically, learn and do your own DD and TA. In a good memory of u/ControlTheNarrative, at least.

And so, it begins. Despite it may seem that there are too many unknown or at least questionable variables for now in this GMESS TA, I believe that I was able to identify the most crucial parameters to build the core of this technical analysis's thesis, since VWSS and TSLASS provided many clues and identifiable characteristics to refer to. The first and most important one is surely the 'Purple Haze'. I should remind you, that this mystically sounding level persistently held back the price for both of the squeeze examples discussed, and only upon the breakout of this level the short squeezes were initiated. For GME this major price level seems to be at about $233 mark, with two intensive tests in Jan and Mar, which proved it to be the most significant resistance on the chart above.

Then, the shapes. The 'Squeezy Grail' (again occurring in between 78.6% and 100%) consolidation is also easily identifiable here, and it is yet again followed by the rectangular 'Runway' consolidation, where the price action currently stands. Remember, how historically (in TSLA and VW) the 'Purple Haze' breakout occurred somewhere near the spot of the current GME price action, in 0.382 Fibo time zone? Well, to paraphrase Ian Fleming: once is (VW) happenstance. Twice is (TSLA) coincidence. Three times is GMenemy action.

Fibos. Applying these two instruments to GME was real pain in the ass. Firstly, because the retracement is not usually used as a predictive instrument, being ordinarily applied to the completed trend. But since the situation is not ordinary at all, I played smarter (or more autistic, if you like). Due to the fact that the 'Purple Haze' level was approximately in between 78.6% and 100% Fibo in both of the previous examples, I assumed exactly that to be applicable here too. My belief is firmly backed up by this soft touch of 78.6% by the price action on Jan 28th. And when these two major levels were identified, the Fibo retracement horizontal grid just stretched out on GME itself.

Identifying the starting points for the trend for both Fibos was the most tricky part. After countless attempts and failures I found what I believe to be the cornerstone to the squeeze:

[Fibos' initiation point zoomed in](https://preview.redd.it/t2ouren1d2z61.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1cd87d96bb42ac20451c86059295f7560c8c44e8)

&#x200B;

Why? Because this                        ☝️ is clearly where the fun started.

And now it all matches perfectly. So, I am patiently waiting for the 'Purple Haze' to be broken. And what do you do, fellow retard?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

They say, that coincidence doesn't happen a third time. I say, we shall see.

**TL;DR** is in the comments.

We all remember when he complained that shorting should be illegal, and when he released “short shorts” when he finally defeated them. 

But guess who used to brag about shorting Tesla? Gabe 🌈🐻 Plotkin. 

From [Bloomberg:](https://www.bloomberg.com./news/articles/2019-07-19/cohen-cub-gabriel-plotkin-sees-fund-surge-about-44-this-year)

Plotkin described Melvin as “a very human-intensive place. We have a lot of analysts, we require a lot out of them.” The team has modeled more than 500 companies in “significant detail,” while a data science group reads into trends.
He added that the firm has an “intense focus” on the short side, with about 70% of profits in Melvin’s first year coming from bearish bets. Plotkin expressed skepticism about mall real estate investment trusts, as well as electric-car maker Tesla Inc.

$GME to the 🌚, then profits back to a safe store of value: $TSLA.

Here is my current short position: **Step 1:**

✅ **Step 2**  
Short at: $1,200\~  
Amount: $200K\~   
Shares to buy: 166\~

New Cost Basis: $1,000,117.03\~  
New Average: $1,354.91\~

I plan to cash out after a -30% drop, maybe ill aim for a 50% drop which means Tesla would be either at $949.44 for a -30%. Or, $677.45 for the -50%. This leaves Tesla with room to run from its current position of $1,100 a 23% gain to the final breakeven point or, 54% to the final optional step.   


**Worst Case:**   
Tesla runs up from my even price of $1,354.91 to $2,100 a $2.1 Trillion Market Cap. I'll take a half a million dollar loss which I can afford all day, any day. Won't kill me. (-50%).  


✍️**Note:**  
If Tesla doubles from its current price, it will be worth more than Apple and Microsoft by $1 Trillion Dollars.  I strongly believe the ROI for new buyers is dramatically decreasing. In other words, the Greater Fool is running low/near the end. There is too much risk, too many emotions, and greed flowing around. Be fearful when others are greedy. In this case, ill profit from their beyond delusional greed. Or, Tesla is currently at peak levels and I don't even get to the next steps. Still a win.

UPDATE 1: 
FAQs since y’all ask the same god damn questions 
- Why exercise instead of sell the contracts and just buy the shares? Because they were so in the money I would have had to pay massive short term capital gains taxes. 
- when did you buy the contracts? 9-12 months ago. 
- do you still believe in TSLA? Yes, it’s my biggest holding. It’s the most innovative company of our lifetime and will probably be the world’s most valuable company before the end of the decade. 
- will you teach me options? No, read/watch everything you can to learn. 
- what options are you buying right now? Basically none, all you degenerates have driven up the premiums and there are few good deals. I buy shares and I sell options on occasion. Only ~5% of my portfolio is options.

Musk Pay Package is a lose/lose for TSLA,844,1dcthx9,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1dcthx9/musk_pay_package_is_a_loselose_for_tsla/,314,2024-06-11 00:30:58,"I believe the upcoming TSLA shareholder's meeting could be a lose/lose for the company.  At issue: whether shareholders believe Musk should receive his $56B pay package (originally agreed in 2018 and struck down by a Delaware judge earlier this year).  Proxy advisory firms ISS and Glass Lewis have recommended against approving the package, and many institutional investors have followed their lead.  Still, a majority (56%) of those [surveyed](https://www.teslarati.com/morgan-stanley-survey-tesla-investors-will-ratify-elon-musk-2018-comp-plan/) said they expect the proposal to be approved.

However, whichever way this vote goes, I expect a negative outcome for TSLA.  There's one of two outcomes:

**A) Musk Pay Approved**

* If the pay package is approved, it would bring Musk's ownership of the company close to 25% and dillute all other shareholders by 10%.
* For many shareholders I expect this to be the last straw for them.  Those who vote against the package will see this as musk trying to extract as much value as he can from a dying company.  Especially after this year's sales slowdown (Hertz is [selling](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/06/ev-sales-slump-hertz-dump-take-used-tesla-to-no-haggle-25000-price.html) off its Tesla fleet, admitting the move was a mistake) and axing of the entire supercharger team.  Not to mention Musk's continued shitposting [alienating](https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/elon-musk-turned-democrats-off-tesla-when-he-needed-them-most-176023af) desperately needed democrat buyers.

**B) Musk Pay Denied**

* If the pay package is denied, I think it would indicate the beginning of the end for Tesla.  Musk has already said that he would shift his focus to his other companies if he doesn't get his $56B.
* He has threatened to develop AI at one of his other companies instead, and has already admitted to diverting Nvidia GPUs from Tesla to xAI and Twitter.
* Musk has been the primary driving force behind Tesla, and without his presence and constant hype I think his diehard supporters will begin to reevaluate their ownership of Tesla stock, leading to a major selloff.

Why I'm playing TSLA puts today,604,1eaf4yn,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1eaf4yn/why_im_playing_tsla_puts_today/,327,2024-07-23 23:57:10,"Guys, we have an insane earnings week and I just wanted to put in my two cents for TSLA today. 

Here’s what they're expecting:

* Earnings per share: 62 cents expected

* Revenue: $24.77 billion expected

Just for comparison:  A year ago, Tesla reported 91 cents of EPS and sales of $24.9 billion. First and formost, I'm getting a put spread. Not puts. IV is just way too high for just puts. Spreads reduce the IV and focuses more on the underlying. But why puts? The stock actually PUMPED hard last earnings. Well, let me explain. 

Lower sales volume and vehicle prices are behind the expected decline. Tesla delivered about 444,000 vehicles in the second quarter at an average realized price of $42,500. A year ago, the company shipped about 466,000 vehicles at an average price of about $44,000.

There's really no indicators telling me that they're doing better as a constant decline in sales will probably continue well into 2025. Just look at the headlines. Musk's cybertruck is a complete failure. The tesla semi is a dud. The tesla roaster isn't out and will never be out. And his other projects? Hyperloop, solar panel shingles? All busts. 

Yea I'm expecting a >10% drop today. TSLA 7/26 240p is just a bit too expensive for an earning play, so this is why I'm getting the spread. Buying the 240p while selling the 225p (same exp) seems like a smart choice to me. I can grab the spread for 477 bucks right now at the time of writing. Meaning, if TSLA drops as much as I expect today, this spread should profit over 3x. Good luck!",0.0,2024-07-23,4

I'm a value investor, but TSLA has finally reached a price today ($165) I consider a steal.  Everyone should have at least 1-5% of their portfolio in TSLA at these prices.   No doubt the stock has short term problems.  From slowing China sales, to Hertz dropping it, to slowdown in German production.  And that is already reflected in the price. In 6 months, it’s dropped almost in half from $299 to $165.  But there are some major long term points the market is missing:

Robotaxis.  

I believe there is at least a 50% probability that Tesla has an Nvidia-like moment w/in the next ten years when the first Tesla robotaxis hit the streets. Imagine Tesla makes a car for $20K.  That car then picks up passengers* for nearly 24 hours per day (except when charging itself).  That car could easily generate $50K annually.  That’s a 2.5X annual return for every car they manufacture.  

They made 1.85M cars in 2023.  Up 38% YOY.  If they can grow by 15% (far less than 38%), that's 7.5M cars in 10 years.  Each car (robotaxi) generates $50K+ per year.  That's $375M+ in revenue.  It'd be a virtual cash machine valued (at the lowest) 5+ times revenue.  That's at least a $1.875T Market Cap. 

Other EV Pain is Tesla’s Gain.

Tesla dropped prices largely because they can, unlike the other EV makers. The legacy autos (ie Ford, GM) and even new rivals (ie Rivian) don’t have any margins on EVs yet.  They actually lose money by making them. So the competition is getting frustrated and giving up. That’s making people believe the whole industry is hurt.  But that pain is actually gain for Tesla, in the form of future market share. And it shows just how high a mountain they already climbed.  Nobody else can figure out how to make EVs profitably.  Tesla is one of the best run companies in the world and that’s how they accomplished it. They have some of the best engineers and maintain a very lean operation.  

Fair Value

If you believe that in the next ten years Tesla will be a trillion dollar company, you should buy at these prices.   If we discount at a 5.5% rate, 1,000,000,000 / 1.055^10 = $585M, which would correlate to a Tesla stock price of $184.19 (because there are 3.176M shares outstanding).  I personally believe that Tesla is going to be a $2T or even $3T company.  Discounting the previously mentioned $1.875T market cap would land at a current price of $345.",0.0,2024-03-14,3

***TLDR:*** **$**TSLA is likely partnering with $VALE to produce the insane quantity of Nickel needed to make Tesla’s vehicles, this is almost certainly happening for the following reasons…

***READ FULL BEST DD ON WSB***

* $VALE is the largest nickel producer in the entire world, with Tesla constantly calling for more Nickel production the partnership potential for these two companies is a match made in heaven.
* $VALE notified creditors on September 14th that it was paying off it’s $5 billion debt, suggesting a large deal leveling them an insane amount of capital.
* $VALE’s trading volume is up 37% from it’s average and has bullish whale activity in the options chain.
* Earlier this month, $VALE announced that they would be paying an extra dividend, on top of their regularly scheduled dividend, reinforcing the thesis of a strong balance sheet
* Tesla and $VALE already have a history of being bidirectional business partners for over a year.
* Conservative estimates reveal Tesla's growth plan leaves $VALE’s competitors ill equipped to deal with the demand for nickel Tesla needs to produce it's vehicles within five years.

**>>>TESLA NEEDS NICKEL<<<**

If there is one to take away from this post, it is the fact that Tesla vehicles need nickel and insane quantities of it. No one is better equipped to supply nickel to Tesla than $VALE. During Tesla’s Q2 earnings call, Elon [painstakingly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lvmOJGC_es&amp;t=37m39s) laid out how badly they were looking for a nickel producer.

“Well, I’d just like to re-emphasize, any mining companies out there, please mine more nickel. Okay. Wherever you are in the world, please mine more nickel and don’t wait for nickel to go back to some long — some high point that you experienced some five years ago, whatever. Go for efficiency, obviously environmentally-friendly nickel mining at high volume. Tesla will give you a giant contract for a long period of time, if you mine nickel efficiently and in an environmentally-sensitive way. So hopefully this message goes out to all mining companies. Please get nickel.”

**>>>THE STARS ALIGNED<<<**

The following points are largely circumstantial evidence, however when stacked together create an extremely powerful narrative and points toward the extreme likelihood of $VALE actually having lined up a *revolutionary* deal with Tesla.

**Quotes from Tesla Q2 2020 Earnings Call**

“There’s so much to be excited about. It’s really hard to kind of fit into this call, but the sheer amount of hardcore engineering, especially on the autonomy and the manufacturing/engineering front is mind-blowing. And then of course there’s Battery Day, which is coming up pretty soon. And I think that’s really going to surprise people by just how much there is to see.”-Elon Musk

“Yeah. The real limitation on Tesla growth is cell production at affordable price. That’s the real limit. So that’s where — we’re going to talk about — a lot more about this on Battery Day because this is a fundamental scaling constraint. And any part of that supply chain or processing at the cell level will be a limiting factor. So whatever it may be, anywhere from mining to refining — there’s many steps from refining to cathode and anode, cell formation. Whatever the choke point is, that will set the growth rate. And so we expect to expand our business with Panasonic, with CATL, with LG, possibly with others, and there’s a lot more to say on that front on Battery Day.”-Elon Musk

“Well, I’d just like to re-emphasize, any mining companies out there, please mine more nickel. Okay. Wherever you are in the world, please mine more nickel and don’t wait for nickel to go back to some long — some high point that you experienced some five years ago, whatever. Go for efficiency, obviously environmentally-friendly nickel mining at high volume. [Tesla will give you a giant contract for a long period of time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lvmOJGC_es&amp;t=37m39s), if you mine nickel efficiently and in an environmentally-sensitive way. So hopefully this message goes out to all mining companies. Please get nickel.”-Elon Musk

“Like the thing that bugs me the most about where we are right now is that our cars are not affordable enough. We need to fix that. So we’re all making progress in that regard, just sort of steadily gaining progress. So yeah, we need to not go bankrupt, obviously. That’s important, because then we’ll fail in our mission. But we’re not trying to be super profitable either, obviously, profitability is like 1% or something, just 1% or 2%. It’s not crazy. Last quarter, it was only like 0.1%. So we want to be profitable. Like I think just we want to be like slightly profitable and maximize growth, and make the cars as affordable as possible, and that’s what we’re trying to achieve.”-Elon Musk

**Philippe Houchois — Jefferies — Analyst**

“Yes, good afternoon. Thank you. You mentioned a few times about the constraint to growth is battery capacity still. And I was hoping you could clarify the scope of the Berlin plant you’re building right now. Will there be — the battery capacity consistent with the amount of assembly volume you expect to come out of Berlin? And if not, will you be able to source your battery requirements out of Europe? Will you have to import batteries from outside Europe to ensure production in Berlin?

Elon Musk — Chief Executive Officer

Okay. We can’t say too much about this, except that there will be local cell production, and that will serve the needs of the Berlin factory. Drew, is there anything…?”([TeslaRati](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-giga-berlin-battery-facility-missing-ingredient/) by Joey Klender)

[$VALE mines](http://www.vale.com/en/business/mining/pages/default.aspx) nickel in Brazil, Canada, Indonesia and New Caledonia making it the *LARGEST* producer of nickel. VALE has joint-venture refineries in China, South Korea, Japan, the UK and Taiwan. These locations will help deliver nickel to the Tesla factories in North America, Berlin and China.

**Future Nickel Demand**

[According To Tesla CEO Elon Musk, This Metal is The New Gold](https://insideevs.com/news/440582/elon-musk-lithium-ion-battery-nickel-is-new-gold/)

The demand and future of nickel will continue to grow for the foreseeable future. Electric vehicles and other modern technology NEED nickel to function.

“With demand expected to increase from 2.2 million metric tons to somewhere in the range of 3.5 million to 4.0 million metric tons by 2030, the nickel market could become constrained.”-McKinsey and Company By Marcelo Azevedo, Nicolas Goffaux, and Ken Hoffman

&#x200B;

**Elon Musk’s Emphasis on “Environmentally Friendly”**

During the call and clip that was hyperlinked above, Elon emphasizes the demand for an “environmentally friendly” mine. Historically, we all know mines have run into trouble with being friendly toward the environment. Today more than ever, a company's concern for the environment must be vocally expressed and physically acknowledged. If not, the reporters and media will bash Tesla for not being environmentally sensitive. Elon Musk understands this and is aware that the nickel company Tesla chooses must at least appear as if they are environmentally “sensitive"". Vale’s website has information on how they are [sustainable](http://www.vale.com/EN/investors/information-market/annual-reports/sustainability-reports/Sustainability%20Reports/Relatorio_sustentabilidade_vale_2019_alta_en.pdf) and [conscious](http://www.vale.com/esg/en/Pages/Home.aspx) of the controversies surrounding the mining industry.

“Given Tesla’s focus on sustainability, the company is likely to prefer to buy from miners of higher-grade nickel sulphide, which requires less power to process than laterite ore, said Lachlan Shaw of National Australia Bank.”-Reuters, Yilei Sun, Melanie Burton“There are three key suppliers - Brazil's Vale VALE3.SA, which operates in Canada using some hydropower, Russia's Norilsk Nickel GMKN.MM and BHP Group's operations BHP.AX in Western Australia. **""**[**Vale**](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/please-mine-more-nickel-musk-urges-as-tesla-boosts-production-2020-07-23) **is in the box seat,""** he said.”-Reuters, Yilei Sun, Melanie Burton

Just the appearance and attempt to be environmental is enough to scare away most journalists who are looking to make a hit piece on Tesla. To wrap it up, Vale has the efficient, sustainable, and environmental mining that Elon Musk is looking for.

**News Doesn't Care About Technical Analysis**

No matter how good the TA setup is for $VALE, news does not give a FUCK about TA. If it has a catalyst to moon... moon it will.

**Cash Flow**

The increasing and regular cash flow has built a very strong balance sheet for VALE and the consistent high yield will keep the loyal investors around. In addition to this year's regular dividend, $VALE is paying investors an extra dividend of 1.63% on the same day as the regular. According to research firms such as CFRA, the management team has been very active and engaged to keep the company moving in the right direction despite COVID-19 setbacks and a decrease in steel demand.

&#x200B;

[Balance Sheet](https://preview.redd.it/hcxgvciw7wn51.png?width=1075&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa93c4900ae6b2ddff9dbcaa65029553888f54e5)

**Competition**

$HNCKF (Giga Metals corp) a competing mining company ***fell*** 18.84% today after being in the news about [potentially](https://www.foxbusiness.com/technology/tesla-discussions-low-carbon-nickel-supply) being a candidate for Tesla’s nickel demand. Currently, at a conservative rate, Giga’s mine would stop being able to satisfy Tesla’s Nickel needs by 2025, assuming they would be able to begin mining operations immediately. On the other hand, yesterday (Sept. 16), Vale announced that they had created buffers to reach production of 400 million metric tons of total mineral mining per year in a filing that was part of an investor tour presentation. Nickel is one of the five metals Vale mines.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**I'll scratch your back if you scratch mine**

Tesla and Vale already have a bidirectional relationship that GM and NKLA could never even dream of. Tesla and Vale have a history of working together. In March, “Antonin Beurrier, CEO of Vale-NC and Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, signed a contract, an offtake agreement for the delivery of intermediate mixed nickel and refined cobalt (Nickel Hydroxide Cake-NHC) produced in New Caledonia. The product will become part of Tesla’s battery composition. The purchased volume remains confidential.”-Tesmanian by [Eva Fox](https://www.tesmanian.com/blogs/tesmanian-blog/tesla-nickel-and-cobalt-contract-for-goro)  ([original french source](https://la1ere.francetvinfo.fr/nouvellecaledonie/tesla-contrat-nickel-goro-usine-du-sud-854234.html)). Tesla and Vale have already signed a confidential contract in regards to Tesla’s battery composition materials needed.

In 2019, Tesla hired an Engineer from Vale-NC to “facilitate procurement and familiarization with the products of the Caledonian plant”

""Tesla has recruited an engineer in a nickel-cobalt refinery in New Caledonia, that of Vale, in order to facilitate purchases for its large European electric vehicle factory in Berlin.""

**Vale using Tesla’s Lithium batteries at Guaiba iron ore port**

“Iron ore miner Vale is installing a Tesla battery energy storage system at Ilha Guaiba terminal in Rio de Janeiro state to help meet power needs at the port as it moves toward energy saving technology.”[\-London](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/metals/082520-miner-vale-to-use-tesla-lithium-batteries-at-guaiba-iron-ore-port)“

The project will substitute 20% of the facility's power costs using Tesla manufactured lithium-ion batteries with technology contributing to decarbonization plans, Vale said in an Aug. 24 statement.”[\-London](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/metals/082520-miner-vale-to-use-tesla-lithium-batteries-at-guaiba-iron-ore-port)

**Tesla’s technology is being used to lower costs at Vale’s iron ore** and to contribute to the “decarbonization plans”. If you remember in the Q2 conference call, Elon Musk was searching for *environmental and efficient* nickel. Vale has that now thanks to Tesla's battery technology.

***More Vale environmentalism***

‘Vale recently announced investments of over $2 billion to reduce direct and indirect carbon dioxide emissions by 33% until 2030, in accordance with the Paris Agreement. Vale said it intends to become carbon neutral by 2050.”

""As Vale continues to decarbonize its operations, the use of batteries will become an increasingly important part of the electrification of our fleet,"" Vale's energy director Ricardo Mendes said in the statement.

""This project allows us to test new technology in the field and accelerate Vale's energy transformation, which aims to achieve self-sufficiency by increasing electric power generation mainly through solar and wind sources in addition to our hydroelectric power generation,""-[London](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/events/americas/caribbean-energy)

Guess [who](http://www.vale.com/indonesia/EN/business/mining/nickel/Pages/default.aspx) has a large nickel mine in Indonesia, $VALE

**Pricing and Math**

After calculating a very conservative estimate of how much nickel Tesla would be needing in the future, these were the results… (see figure below)

With a *conservative* estimate of a $43 billion dollar contract, $43 billion minus the operating margin (38%)= $16.5 billion. This gives the stock 28% upside. The price target for $VALE is **$15.36** with a 5% variance giving a low at $14.80 and a high of $16.00 Not to mention the stock market acts very irrational in times of hype, the stock could very well overreact to $20+CFRA’s current 12 month price target for VALE is $15.00, whom most likely have not anticipated Tesla news. (If they get the news, this thing will FLY based on what we have seen this year)

Elon Musk [stated](https://youtu.be/3lvmOJGC_es?t=2295) that Tesla “will give you a ***giant*** contract for a ***long period of time***

&#x200B;

[Conservative nickel projections](https://preview.redd.it/c5ydb1bb8wn51.png?width=735&format=png&auto=webp&s=be476e98a06084e36a5dafe6b146663b6d7b1084)

&#x200B;

This is not taking into account that the price of nickel is lagging in comparison to its current and future demand. Current nickel price as of 9/16/20: $15,229.50 per ton

&#x200B;

[Nickel Price: $15,229.50 per ton](https://preview.redd.it/lseg7ide8wn51.jpg?width=1918&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3e870fd5e94c9b6e23dc19b438b0a6d3dc5bcbb6)

Once the demand for nickel goes up and the supply grows scarce, that's easy economics theory, nickel price goes up.

**The Plot Thickens**

We remember this one. He had called out that Tesla stock was too high at a pre split price of $750

* The timestamp 8:11 signaled calendar date 8/11
* The date of posting May 1st turned into 5/1
* “Tesla stock price is too high imo” signaled that a stock split was imminent

What happened, on 8/11 Tesla announced a 5/1 stock split

* Battery day is on the same day $VALE’s ex date for the regular and extra dividend (9/22)

**Listen Up,**

I hate to interrupt while you are planning your wife's and her boyfriend's romantic getaway for the Independence Day weekend. With you sitting alone at home priced in, we can focus on something you did not do for a long time now: **Make some fucking money.**

Before I share the trade of a century with you, we need to squeeze in a little history lesson. As your frontal lobes probably only fully developed in the last 12 months, you would not know what the fuck I am talking about otherwise. A word of caution tho: **this post is longer than the night you had to spend in daycare because your parents forget to pick you up.**

So get comfy, grab your favorite pacifier and let’s go.

# Part 1: The lore of the electric Käfer

Spool back to the start of 2018. A blissful, maskless world. The worst geopolitical issue anyone can remember was some tariffs on Chinese imports. A much less famous Elon Musk was in the middle of completing phase 3 of the “(not so) secret master plan” of building an affordable ($35k) electric car for the masses. After its introduction in 2017, the initial production ramp turned out to be a lot **harder and more complex than initially thought**. Plans to fully automate the production line were scrapped and human workers were allowed on the factory floor.

https://preview.redd.it/l65x5ou4bx891.png?width=1197&format=png&auto=webp&s=88e48e58b1063e751f302da29331d3970773987c

You know what else was on the factory floor every night? Elon Musk himself. He deemed it necessary to be there 24/7 to micromanage the production ramp. Later accounts of line managers suggested, that he was told to “fuck off” more than once when he started herassing sleepless workers with questions about production efficiency and workflows. He really, really wanted it. How much of that was for show? We‘ll never know but it's damn clear that he was hustling hard. Years later he gave a late praise to the people that made it all possible by tweeting

>“Humans are underrated”.

**Heartwarming**.

Mind you, back then he was not in a position of strength and accomplishment. Not the richest man in the world. People were betting he was going to fail, and fail hard at it.

Tesla was called a fraud, subsidy abuser, unsustainable and vaporware. Short sellers were pouring in and CNBC was readily giving them a stage.

https://preview.redd.it/6e1ykqmpax891.png?width=1118&format=png&auto=webp&s=f258dbbe09bcef58c6f58d154ccb7533b21007a5

When things started to look better, Musk went on an acid bender with his new girlfriend Claire Boucher a.k.a Grimes and Elizah Banks. Apart from some embarrassing leaked tweets that I will spare you for reasons of decency, **this bombshell hit the wire:**

https://preview.redd.it/naua05dsax891.png?width=1184&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b3f816b65fa17d6679f8689f76dd6ee767feb5b

**If you are looking for the exact point in time where EM decided he will not have any more of the short seller bullshit, this was it.**

Our good friend Jim Cramer was also starting to take a closer interest in Tesla. It will take a couple more months before he flipped to one of the most jacked up [TSLA](https://markets.sh/symbols/NASDAQ:TSLA) bulls only seconds to Cathie Wood, but it should eventually happen.

https://preview.redd.it/62esvsptax891.png?width=1184&format=png&auto=webp&s=1423b742449a10251d3ae1477b6df34cf8b5d7d3

The deal fell through and Tesla did not go private.. After a volatile and largely range-bound start we have the company at a relatively stable valuation of around 50 Billion USD.

# Part 2: Short shorts for the Shorts

We have already established that Elon Musk is a hustler and will follow his lofty goals relentlessly. If the “funding secured” tweet was the first battle against the eclectic clique of short sellers, known as TESLAQ on Twitter, **we are now going to war.**

As you might have heard already, valuations are all about future expectations. The bull case for Tesla was to become a really successful “luxury” car maker. They are dabbling with energy and driver assist but with the seriousness of Google with their chat products. Maybe something with Solar panels. About that. As you may have also heard, cars are a notoriously shitty business to be in. **They combine everything MBA’s are afraid of.**

* Insanely capital intensive
* Very elastic demand, sales drop right when you need them most (Looking at you ford, GM in 2008)
* Humongous unionized workforce
* Stiff competition
* Razor thin margins
* Stupid amounts of regulation (and lots of markets with diverging regulation)
* Supply chains longer than the river Nile

You get the point. Compared to most other industries, except maybe pharma or aerospace (like SpaceX, you know), car companies are just bad businesses. This is the reason why before Tesla there was not really any new major car company for 100 years.

**No wonder shorts are piling in. If car companies are hard, startup electric car companies are near damn impossible.**

As you probably learned in business school, no company is really in one industry and most companies consider their products a temporary solution for an ever evolving need.

Famously, Railroads are really “Transportation” companies, Postal Services are actually banks, and prostitutes are really just mental health workers.

**That being said, some industries are just so damn profitable that they really don’t need to play these charades. They are for the most part, MBA’s darling. Prestigious, Predictable and Profitable PPP.**

What comes to mind here? Financials, e.g Banks? Yes!  Insurance Companies? you bet! Software, Energy? for sure! You know who **loves** this kind of business?

https://preview.redd.it/nddze2sfyx891.png?width=1451&format=png&auto=webp&s=ec09835151e77b3dd587617e7ba39c76a8fecdaf

Damn right. **Warren Buffet.** The beloved godfather of predictable cash flows. So why don’t we take these attractive business models

[Are you getting it?](https://preview.redd.it/67vg4z62bx891.png?width=1197&format=png&auto=webp&s=b4cff05cd6cb87bf04a503781935fba4b2323df5)

And cosplay as the messiah of capitalism. Enron pulled it off, why can’t we? **We just need to spin it into something so impossibly ambitious that people will actually believe it.**

https://preview.redd.it/i2nmy697bx891.png?width=1187&format=png&auto=webp&s=7719be8585e97c1997cdd36879aa93c6c730997c

If you are looking for a ground zero for what will happen in 2020, it started right there. Autonomy day 2019 was the birth of the grandiose vision. Full Self Driving was going to work next year and don’t bother trying to buy your leased model 3, we need it back and will pimp it out to drunken teens for 95% profit margins.

**Combine that vision with one of the most public product launches of the last decade.**

https://preview.redd.it/m1g24y5zyx891.png?width=2373&format=png&auto=webp&s=aba28abe9b87c212b0db605dfef3cd33258caa7b

Add a vertically integrated battery and insurance company and you have that. Just make sure that you have a **99.999% stock based compensation** plan with impossible hurdles that makes the board chuckle because you cannot possibly reach them. **EVER**.

[Head of Tesla cheerleading team with her girls.](https://preview.redd.it/pk7jor6pbx891.png?width=1023&format=png&auto=webp&s=ccad3cb3110df998b7d8fc0bb9e0f90b68c6f082)

Enter 2020. After a short rally into February, **a now famous virus from china sent futures worldwide into perpetual limit-down**. The shorts finally got their big drop but could not celebrate. Everything else went to shit too. Everyone born after 2020, make sure you go into the next 3 sigma crash fully invested. Only second to storming the beaches of Normandy, **this shit will really make you feel alive on a visceral level.**

Every person on the planet that owned even a single share of anything, got the pounding of a lifetime. After some cautious easing attempts the Fed felt the need again to do something **BIG**

&#x200B;

# Part 3: Liftoff

Now with the vision established, it is time for the crown piece. Having engineered both rockets that fucking land themselves and electric cars that people actually like, doing some financial engineering to fix the valuation should not be too hard.

**Remember Kids**: Financial engineering is like real engineering. Except the only resource you have is money. This is why it drives such perverse products. What comes out of Goldman Sachs, is not unlike something that comes out of a prison cell after someone spends 12 months weaponizing instant coffee.

**So how do we fix the valuation?**

https://preview.redd.it/mzq5kf7ubx891.png?width=1172&format=png&auto=webp&s=d1c622bf951276c25ac19a9a9d945d94e896b2c3

After we have got the foundation laid out and the media finally acknowledging the electric car revolution is actually happening, we just need the basic ingredients for any  good bull story.  **Hype, momentum and FOMO.** Combine this with the infinite gamma from a wall of call options, shorts trying to cover desperately, FSD just months away now, positive earnings surprises and a nice 1:5 split as kicker. We should get that sleepy stock started, no?

**You bet!** Tesla valuation did not only reach escape velocity, it was the centerpiece of the most violent and relentless bull since at least two decades. This was not a bubble. **Bubbles burst at these G-Forces.**

This market had the energy of someone in the club, at 4am, almost blackout drunk, finding a **baggie of uncut coke in his pocket and deciding to have a last dance.**

https://preview.redd.it/kybobaavbx891.png?width=1172&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae58e006a733b8ec9aab967aae15a42d50c74c50

**Everyone, EVERYONE** was buying calls, **WSB** was buying tech calls, your mom was buying calls.

Even **Softbank** bought calls. The biggest and most Vapid unicorn VC. The poster child of dumb money. Usually the last stop before wonky unicorns raise the final round before going public or broke. Even they decided to decided to chip in. **And in a big way.**

[A Billion Dollar VC fund suddenly gambling their portfolio money on call options is a bit unusual. ](https://preview.redd.it/ll1hhzzwbx891.png?width=1211&format=png&auto=webp&s=51f8a77613ac4d0463cbe5deaad7322127a9fd5d)

Thank you for your service! **Of course they still managed to lose money on it, which surprised nobody but was an incredible feat, considering just how HOT this market was.**

All brought Tesla's valuation to the insane valuation of **1 Trillion USD.** We gave back some of these gains but **the valuation can still be described as “somewhat” lofty.**

https://preview.redd.it/ddg5aq6ybx891.png?width=1211&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb4f2b91dfec490e7e282ad18bd05976240038cd

# 4. The short the short shorts short

I am really surprised that you are still reading these ramblings, but it's your time after all. So before we jump right into the trade recommendation let me speak a word of warning.

**What I am going to  suggest will go against one of the axioms of the post-pandemic market: “Never short Tesla”, especially if you use options the chances that you will lose all your money are close to 100%.**

As you know the market as a whole did not have a great start into 2022. Tesla lost about 40% of value already. Are we not late to the party? Hell, no! The thing is, Tesla's bull story is still largely intact. The company is still priced around incredible growth in the next few years with little headwinds, and a late but ultimately successful completion of the FSD project.

**And as we have learned, the market really can’t stomach any cracks in pristine growth stories right now. With rates on the rise like this, the moment you have to tweak the growth slider on your fancy little DCF model, the bullish hockeystick projection goes all limp. And right quick.**

For reference please have a look at a recent example of a swift valuation change.

[Lets look at the growth rate again. ](https://preview.redd.it/ltesnjnjsx891.png?width=1242&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f49f1ebb746f2cd305807ce55821c15d9fc4a5f)

I am not saying that Tesla will have a similar fate as SHOP, it is truly a different ballpark of a company all around. What I am saying is, that Shopify, Netflix, Meta, Amazon already had a reality check on their growth stories while Tesla's remains largely intact. If you factor in the beta of 2, it moved more in line with the rest of the market.

So, what happens next? I would say that there is a reasonable chance that Tesla will also have a checkup on their current valuation. I see it at a more reasonable market cap of 300-400 Billion. Which is still factoring in a lot of growth and success. This is NOT a doomsday scenario, where Tesla goes bust. No. This is purely a little gamble that there will be some adjustments based on some upcoming catalysts. Tesla is currently playing high stakes head-up poker against the market.

**This is one of the last hands as deliveries will be released tomorrow and the earnings call is coming up next month. So my guess is, that whatever happens now will happen quickly as Tesla is still the vagus nerve of the tech market.**

They know that we know. And just as in 2018-2021 they are trying to prime the public to what will happen next.

https://preview.redd.it/e26zxgjayx891.png?width=1509&format=png&auto=webp&s=3fc399243c95a7f9cb32988a2b27aa2c37c6e8bb

**Let’s try to read a bit into the recent clues.**

1. Scaling car manufacturing is hard. Judging from Elons recent tweets, that the new factories are “Giant Money Money furnaces” we could be looking at higher cost or projected capital needs.
2. Elon did not not Tweet for nine days. I am not sure if this happened in recent history. What is the message here? Twitter is overvalued? Belly ache? Who knows.
3. Layoffs, layoffs, layoffs. Everyone is doing it so it is not unusual per se. Combined with the recent work from home and union debacle, it indicates that there might be cost pressures, greater than anticipated.
4. Laying off a big part of the FSD labelling team in California is also interesting. Move. First of all, you are insane paying california salaries for data entry if your tooling is good, so that means nothing really. However, considering how important and shaky the FSD story is, the timing is curious.
5. Elon wanting to buy Twitter can mean a lot of things. I would say after Tesla and SpaceX are not going anywhere, he is striving more towards self actualization. Also media influence becomes important when you want to go to mars.
6. FSD is coming. But not with the current hardware and not within the next 12 months.
7. Lets see how the infinite demand story plays out once people have to make some tough choices with their discretionary spending.
8. Tesla makes great cars, I have a model 3. I love it. The issue is, now for the first time the competition looks really nice. When the lease ends it will be a BMW i4.
9. The forbidden fruit on the balance sheet is priced in of course. But let’s see what happens when the mark to market loss on that risky alternative asset class, weaker revenue due to closed factories and rising costs from Texas and Berlin hit at the same time. If we not only have an earnings miss but also a surprise loss, people will lose their shit.
10. The market is shit and people are just waiting to turn their back on investments to get a bit of liquidity back. All the STANS that have 110% of their net worth in Tesla? Watch them keep their cool when the stock hits 550.
11. There are rumors that we are tyring the 2020 playbook once again. A ⅓ stock split and yet another AI day with the mysterious Tesla Bot are coming up. Do we need to pump the stock urgently now?
12. The market is closed on Monday. If tomorrows numbers are bad, people might freak out as they can't get out anymore.

&#x200B;

**This all leads me to the conclusion that a drop to the $200-$400 range within the next 6 months is a real possibility. Why now you are asking?**

* Delivery numbers are released tomorrow
* Earnings are next month
* In between we will get another fucking scary inflation reading.
* Market is closed on Monday.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR:** Due to how shit the market is and the potential of bad news tomorrow and next month, shorting TESLA might get a haircut just like SHOP, AMZN and NFLX. It migth be a good way to make a quick buck now.

&#x200B;

**I am in. How are we playing this?**

If you believe there is some merit to these rumblings, **you buy puts.** Depending on your personal risk tolerance **300 strike puts with 1 month DTE** look about right. If you want to play it safe, L**EAP puts for January ‘23 should get you going**. This is where I am at.

**Positions:**

* **5x Jan 20 '23 140 Put**
* **3x Jan 20 '23 300 Put**
* **2x Jan 20 '23 400 Put**

TSLA: Big question for Elon today on earnings day!,474,1cb3pqq,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1cb3pqq/tsla_big_question_for_elon_today_on_earnings_day/,306,2024-04-23 18:16:19,"IMO, the biggest question for Elon to answer during today’s earnings will be what is Tesla strategy to counter $20K BYD Chinese cars coming into US soon from Mexican factories?

BYD executives announced on Wednesday the automaker will begin selling its Dolphin Mini electric vehicle (EV) in Mexico at 358,800 pesos ($20,990). 

If Elon’s plan to compete with BYD is to ask the president to put 100% tariffs on BYD imports, that’s not a good working plan. As I understand, there’s a limit to tariffs and then it goes to WTO for arbitration. Another problem is China can retaliate with its own sanctions & tariffs!

I have been saying for a long time now, Tesla needs a CEO who can focus on the car, customers & shareholders instead of X, fighting with media and its main customers - the liberals who have almost completely abandoned Tesla. IMO, the way things are going Tesla may go down below $125 soon. Long term, I’m still optimistic on Tesla, unfortunately it has become one manchild dependent company with a spineless board.

The insane $TSLA bull case no analyst sees coming yet,351,1bkwzna,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bkwzna/the_insane_tsla_bull_case_no_analyst_sees_coming/,376,2024-03-22 16:57:53,"BUCKLE UP MFKERS, I GOT THE SCOOP FOR THE NEXT MOONING (AS BIG AS AI WAS)

**TLDR (cuz who here can actually read):** Idgaf about TSLA as a car company, soon noone else will too. Due to China and nerds making insane tech, humanoid robotics will be HUGE by late 2024. TSLA the company that will win this race. Market will realize in a cuppa months. Market for this is 20-100T USD with infinite growth potential. TSLA is quietly becoming the NVIDIA of humanoid robotics.

AI hype has hit the street, you know what that calls for: it's time to pivot to what the old f\*cks on the street is blind to (cuz they're so old).

Humanoid robotics. Any hedge fund manager would laugh, that's why it's genius.

1. Robotics has been around for a long time, but try programming a robot the same way you program a computer and ofc it will fail. It can't reason the way we reason. Since AI popped off, robotics has been reaping the rewards. While yall sleeping, terminator is being built. Check rate of progress from 2022 -> 2024, it's insane and show no signs of slowing.
   1. This is not the boring toyota drunk robots that can't do sh\*t. This is solid progress made at supersonic speeds on making robot workers for real. There is no limits to this actually working, it's an engineering problem at this point and a matter of time.
2. Ofc Xi Jing Ping is sharper than any of the dementia patients sitting in congress. China makes savvy decisions and guess what their plan is: **500 humanoid robot workers / 10 000 ppl by 2025. That is** **3.8 million humanoid robots.** They have put their money where their mouth is and gone b a l l s deep on investment into this. They are showing good results and making insane progress quickly.
   1. The implications here alone are huge: China US rivalry won't die anytime soon. This will force the hand of the US. A trump win would be huge as he can see stuff like this coming. He just needs to talk about it to legitimize the industry, and he surely will.
3. The market for humanoid robots is as big as the market for manual labour as long as the bots can perform the tasks efficiently. Analysts forecasts don't count towards the trajectory we are on. IE THE MARKET IS CURRENTLY 30% OF WORLD GDP WITH NEAR INFINITE GROWTH POTENTIAL.

Here is why TSLA will be a huge winner in this.

* Name of the game in AI is training data, talent and compute. Tesla has huge training data advantage as their vision models already are extremely good.
   * They have already chugged away at this problem for years and years as the chip needs to be inside the robot, and not in some huge gpu datacenter. Guess what they have in their cars: A lightweight, energy efficient chip for exactly this type of processing.
   * They have the human talent and is well regarded in the AI industry. Altough Grok so far has sucked, Elon realizes that it's immensily important to get this model smarter and is putting heavy focus on that. This is directly to augment their tesla bots with reasoning capabilities. Grok is specifically designed to solve reasoning unlike other AI models where the focus is more towards workplace efficiency.
   * They already have a multimodal model with language understanding inside their bots.
   * We should see actually useful humanoid bots working in their factory this year. They will 100% use them internally a lot before selling anything. After proper field tests and refinement the market will be GASPING for these bots. They don't even need to be anywhere as close to good as perfect, they just need to be as good as 70iq darren in minnesota doing the same repetitive task over and over again. We already have that intelligence in language models today.
* Lack of AI day: To quote deranged Elon: *"" Some of our competitors look at what we do on a frame by frame basis. The same happened with Battery Day. So we have to be a little cautious, but some kind of update would be good to do. Will discuss with the team, maybe something later this year. Our main goal with these AI Day things is recruiting and to change the perception of Tesla as a car company.""*
   * Essentially, AI day has not happened bcause they don't want to give up their competitive edge, not because of lack of progress. Once Investors realize TSLA are capable as an AI company, market will reflect that.
* Manufacturing. Idc if figure01 from figureAI is good as balls, they have ZERO experience in manufacturing. Manufacturing these bots will be the hard problem to solve. There is no better company set up for this than TSLA. (MSFT is bull case long term too btw)
   * TSLA CAN TEST THESE BOTS LIVE IN THEIR OWN FACTORIES WHILE DEVELOPING, THE ADVANTAGE IS ENOURMOUS. Having integrated development for exactly the type of customers they would sell to once it's mature.
   * TSLA has walked the road of going from startup to one of the leading EV manufacturers. They continually develop their manufacturing processes, taking insane risks to make it more efficient. THERE IS NO OTHER COMPANY BETTER SET UP TO GET MASS PRODUCTION OF THESE BOTS GOING ONCE THEY'VE REACHED A VIABLE PRODUCT
* Chinese competition: China might very well beat tsla to the punch in this, this is good. Why? Because US would NEVER rely on china to make them their robots. They will turn this into a case of national security faster than i can inseminate my 5'2 mewtoo build gf.

And I haven't even gotten to the best part yet: it doesn't matter if these robots can take over the world or not, ALL THAT MATTERS IS THAT INVESTORS AT SOME POINT THINK THEY CAN. Riding the hype 'bubble' is irrelevant, only thing that matters is being ahead of the bubble.

As engineer, I see no reason that this will be a bubble, just a matter of time. What will be tricky is getting manufacturing up to scale, but from a moon case scenario - that doesn't fkn matter. All that matters is a belief that it will happen and tsla stock price will reflect it. There is NO DOUBT that they are the US company best set up to do this.

**MY POSITION:** Call options for TSLA 350 by dec 2025. (retrad bookie won't let me go higher)

**MY PREDICTION:** TSLA anywhere from 400 - Nvidia levels of valuation (750+) by late 2025. Short term we prolly won't see any gains on tsla due to this development hasn't gotten any hype yet but sometime this late summer / fall (Elon time accounted) we should see the hype about this getting started for real.

Why listen to me? **Don't,** you will jinx my positions.",-1.0,2024-03-22,11

As the picture shows, i'm down pretty bad. Started in December with just $800 and quickly got addicted to putting my savings in thinking its gonna multiply through easy puts. I honestly wasted all my savings within the first two months not knowing what i was doing, went from $6,800 to $600 to $1,200, and from there starting in March I actually did some good plays day by day on SPY and QQQ. I was calling reversals and everything, but the market also just had a lot of momentum. I reached 14.5k, the most money I've ever had at one time, and thought, dang just $500 more to 15k. I switched from my winning strategy of intraday plays and tried holding UVXY calls, Kroger and Zilllow puts (someone posted here about them) and lost a majority of my money by trying to do the same intraday calls/puts. But in April the market stabilized like crazy, my plays didn't work at all anymore and those puts I had lost so much value. I should have stopped but I got desperate, trying to regain my wealth. Honeslt,y if I had just waited three days and took a break, placed it all in Calls, I would easily have gone above $32k and probably not need to ever touch the market again.

I went to Coachella and missed out on a lot of earnings that i DID want to play, which probably would have boosted me really good. Instead the one Earnings i did play was Amazon. Price went from around 108 to 119 to 102 by open, we all remember that. I stayed outta playing for a bit, got my money up to $700 doing SQQQ puts recently, and then Put in another $300 to buy two Tesla calls at different prices for 7/28. 1k wiped out overnight. 

Dumb and stupid choice, I really believed Tesla could break $305. My other friends only played $200-300, buy my dumbass went all in. Seeing 1k again felt so good for a moment. I really dont know what i'm going to do now. I have a lot of debt and basically 0 savings, all my money is just in my checking account going in and out as I get paid. I'm 24 but I feel like a fucking loser cause of all of this. At one point I wanted to take out a $2,500 loan but I was denied.",0.0,2023-07-21,1

Did not trade in 2022 and early 2023.
Became interested because I saw regards posting gains mid 2023.
I had $50k in 401k with a previous employer. Rolled that over to an IRA and started trading.
Made it $180k by 2024 (only stocks)
Enabled options in 2024 and made to $1M

Good luck to you regards!

Cookin' (The Books) With $TSLA: Fuzzy's EBITDA Explainer,1813,g1xq3e,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g1xq3e/cookin_the_books_with_tsla_fuzzys_ebitda_explainer/,638,2020-04-16 00:00:01,"Hello, friends -

It's me, Fuzzy. Welcome back. I know, I know. I'm excited too. I had this up at market open but it got spiked by automod \*twice\* so I'm hoping third time's the charm. 

Did you guys see that movie, *The Accountant*? The one where [Sad Ben Affleck](https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5ab58b2922f093031d9fb8fa/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/Fry-The-Great-Sadness-of-Ben-Affleck.jpg) plays an autistic accountant for organized crime who doubles as a stone-cold killer? Yeah, me neither.  I mainly remember it exists because it features Anna Kendrick, a Fuzzy Fave (TM). In the March Madness for my heart, she's a 4 or 5 seed in her conference for sure (look out, u/pokimane). Anyway, that's what we're going to be talking about today. No, not March Madness (never got the fuss) or Sad Ben Affleck (21st century existential icon) - not even Fuzzy's Faves. Today, we're all about bean-counting - specifically, EBITDA, the magic number that makes all of your accounting problems disappear. I figured it was time you autists got to learnin' how businesses can lose money on paper but still be in the green with their creditors - especially at the moment, what with the bat flu and all, when many businesses are trying to explain that no one should panic and they're still in the black (even though they're definitely not). Let's get started.

Now - disclaimer - I am **not** an accountant (obviously). If you are, feel free to flex in the comments and explain to me how mastery of forward-looking deduction writeoffs or some other fucking word jumble would make me a more complete human and save me $0.03 on my taxes every second five-year rolling addback window. The thing is, like most people that wind up on the human facing side of the finance industry, I cared too much about getting laid in college to give a shit about how to make numbers dance on a P/L statement, so I never really bothered to learn much more than the basics.  Once you hit the real world, though, those pocket-protecting calculator jockeys get preeeetty important, pretty fast. Tax, forensics, regular ol' corporate book-keeping - in business-land, you name it, you need an accountant to either do it for you or sign off on it before you send it to the board. So, you know, accountants. Not all bad.

Anyway, even though I'm not an accountant, one thing I **do** know a lot about is EBITDA. Why? Because it's one of the most hotly contested battlegrounds of modern corporate finance, so I deal with it every day. ""But Fuzzy! How can you negotiate something that's an established accounting concept? Isn't that like trying to change 2+2 so it equals 5?"" And the answer - if EBITDA was a regular accounting concept - would be yes. But fortunately for borrowers, private equity cowboys and corporate finance lawyers (as well as lovers of weasel words everywhere), it's not, so you can. See, there's a difference between GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) and... well everything that's not GAAP. You can't fuck with GAAP. How something \*becomes\* or even \*became\* GAAP in the first place... unclear. I guess in ancient times some bespectacled prophet came down from Mt. Nerd with spreadsheets carved on stone tablets, and whatever was on them wound up being generally accepted. I don't know, I'm not a fucking theologian. But however it happened, you can't fuck with it. Happily, though, EBITDA is non-GAAP, so like all the best girls, it's whatever you want it to be.

But we're getting ahead of ourselves. Today's post is going to be a tale of two halves. We're going to go through what EBITDA is and why it's important, and then we're going to go through a meme-tastic example to show how it can be manipulated - using everyone's favorite manufacturer of tendie-powered cars, rocketships, and flamethrowers... $TSLA!

If you want to play along at home, here's [$TSLA's 10-K](https://ir.tesla.com/static-files/07bfcb70-aba1-4a27-af09-4f101678320c). Now I know people get all hot and bothered about $TSLA for whatever reason (did you know there's a dedicated Tesla investors subreddit? fucking weird). So let's get this clear from the jump - every single company does this, and I'm not implying that $TSLA is doing anything 'wrong' or 'bad'. I don't give a shit about the ticker or the cars or Elon's mission to put weed on Mars or whatever the fuck he's doing these days, so don't come at me in the comments about any of that shit. They're just the example we're using to work through this exercise. They've actually got a fascinating debt structure that is worthy of its own post (Musk or his family can take it private at any point without triggering a change of control under the docs... what?!), but today we're limiting our scope to the way they're allowed to calculate EBITDA.

OK. Ready? Let's do this. Sincere and/or funny questions in the comments answered as always.

1. **EBITDA - A User's Guide**

When it comes to people, it's pretty easy to measure performance. Where you went to school, how much you make, where you live, how hot your wife is, how long... you get the idea. The point is that life is full of concrete, objective measures to help you figure out how worthwhile (or not) you really are as a human. Stretch out to the ""All Time"" view on your RH graph to give yourself an idea of where you sit.

Businesses have a bunch of these metrics they can look at. Profits, cashflow, sales... the list goes on. The issues with most of those, though, is that running a business is a pretty complicated job. There's a whole lot of shit that goes into those numbers each financial year, and not all of it is necessarily indicative of the 'normal' baseline of performance. Maybe you have a bad quarter because of the 'rona (pour one out for $WFC..... yikes). Maybe you get slugged with a tax bill, or a big interest repayment from your bank. Now that might hurt your operating profit on a one-off basis, but it's not something you expect to keep happening. You don't want your shareholders to freak out over nothing. That's where EBITDA comes in (say it like EEE-BIT-DAH).

EBITDA stands for **E**arnings **B**efore **I**nterest **T**axes **D**epreciation and **A**mortization. The idea is essentially to find that baseline - to produce a number which reflects the true earnings of the business when the pernicious influence of taxes, financing, and accounting is taken out of the equation. Basically, you calculate it by **adding back** non-cash expenses to your baseline operating income. That's it. Simple, right? ""OK Fuzz, but what's a non-cash expense? Couldn't that be like... anything?"" Exactly.

Because EBITDA as a concept is more malleable than your more... black and white metrics, borrowers like to use it in loan documentation - particularly in leveraged finance, where it typically serves as the measure of earnings for the company. It's also used as a building block of incurrence baskets - the higher your EBITDA, the more you get to utilize under a particular basket. Usually this is done by way of a either/or construct - you can have $50 million **or** $25%  (or whatever) of your EBITDA, whichever is greater. It also turns up in financial covenants and step-downs in asset sale sweeps, excess cash flow sweeps, and pricing. There's a bunch of other non-finance ways it gets used too, but we're just going to stick to this for now.

Sometimes companies will try and flex their 'record EBITDA' numbers in a 10-K. But if you read on, you'll see  that every time they do this, it's qualified by the fact that it's non-GAAP and not accepted blah blah blah. So just be mindful of that when you're reviewing those documents and always read the real numbers before you make a call on how the business is actually doing.

Anyway, let's see how it can be manipulated.

2. **Cookin' With Elon - The $TSLA Example**

Let's take a peek under the hood of [$TSLA's Credit Agreement](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000119312519095913/d625340dex1068.htm) to see what's going on with their EBITDA. Remember how I said you could calculate EBITDA by just adding back non-cash expenses to operating income? That's right... in theory. Have a look at this (just skim it, reading it cold will give you a headache. I'm going to break it down for you anyway - this is just for illustrative purposes):

>“Consolidated EBITDA” shall mean, for any period, Consolidated Net Income for such period (without giving effect to (w) any extraordinary gains or losses, (x) any non-cash income, (y) any gains or losses from sales of assets other than those assets sold in the ordinary course of business, or (z) any foreign currency gains or losses) adjusted by (A) adding thereto (in each case to the extent deducted in determining Consolidated Net Income for such period (other than clause (ix) below which need not be so deducted)), without duplication, the amount of (i) total interest expense (inclusive of amortization or write-off of deferred financing fees and other original issue discount and banking fees, charges and commissions (e.g., letter of credit issuance and facing fees (including Letter of Credit Fees and Facing Fees), commitment fees, issuance costs and other transactional costs)) of the Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries determined on a consolidated basis for such period, (ii) provision for taxes based on income and foreign withholding taxes for the Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries (including state, franchise, capital and similar taxes paid or accrued) determined on a consolidated basis for such period, (iii) all depreciation and amortization expense of the Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries determined on a consolidated basis for such period, (iv) in the case of any period, the amount of all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Transaction (including in connection with any amendments to the Credit Documents) during such fiscal quarter, (v) any unusual or non-recurring cash charges, (vi) any cash restructuring charges or reserves (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall include retention, severance, system establishment costs, excess pension charges, contract and lease termination costs and costs to consolidate facilities and relocate employees) for such period (a)(x) incurred in connection with an Acquisition consummated after the Effective Date or (y) otherwise incurred in connection with the Company’s and its Consolidated Subsidiaries’ operations in an aggregate amount for all cash charges added back pursuant to this clause (vi) not to exceed 15% of Consolidated EBITDA in any Test Period (calculated before giving effect to this clause (vi)), (vii) any expenses incurred in connection with any actual or proposed Investment, incurrence, amendment or repayment of Indebtedness, issuance of Equity Interests or acquisition or disposition, in each case, outside the ordinary course of business for such period, (viii) expenses incurred to the extent covered by indemnification provisions in any agreement in connection with an acquisition to the extent reimbursed in cash to the Company or any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries and such indemnification payments are not otherwise included in Consolidated Net Income, in each case, for such period, (ix) proceeds received by the Company or any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries from any business interruption insurance to the extent such proceeds are not otherwise included in such Consolidated Net Income for such period, (x) all other non-cash charges of the Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries determined on a consolidated basis for such period, (xi) \[RESERVED\], and (xii) any expenses associated with stock based compensation and (B) subtracting therefrom (to the extent not otherwise deducted in determining Consolidated Net Income for such period) (i) the amount of all cash payments or cash charges made (or incurred) by the Company or any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries for such period on account of any non-cash charges added back to Consolidated EBITDA pursuant to preceding sub-clause (A)(x) in a previous period and (ii) any unusual or non-recurring cash gains. For the avoidance of doubt, it is understood and agreed that, to the extent any amounts are excluded from Consolidated Net Income by virtue of the proviso to the definition thereof contained herein, any add backs to Consolidated Net Income in determining Consolidated EBITDA as provided above shall be limited (or denied) in a fashion consistent with the proviso to the definition of Consolidated Net Income contained herein

Yowza. That's a mouthful, huh? So in this bullshit alphabet soup are some key phrases that we are going to look at to see how businesses can manipulate their YOY figures to appear a bit... better than they would be otherwise. There are your normal should be in there things too, but most is bullshit. Let's pick out the five big ones. My comments on how these can be manipulated are in ALL CAPS after each one.

(1) Transaction costs (with respect to both closing date transactions and other permitted transactions) THIS BASICALLY MEANS THEY CAN SPEND HOWEVER MUCH MONEY THEY WANT ON WHATEVER THEY WANT AS LONG AS IT'S ALLOWED UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT AND THEY CAN ADD IT BACK. THEY CAN ALSO INCLUDE ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH LAWYERS (BECAUSE WE'RE EXPENSIVE), ACCOUNTANTS, CONSULTANTS, WITCH DOCTORS, STRIPPERS... YOU GET THE IDEA. THIS IS ONE WAY THAT CASHFLOW NEGATIVE COMPANIES CAN HAVE A POSITIVE EBITA - YOU SPEND EVERYTHING ON MORE SHIT AND YOU GET CREDITED FOR IT. TSLA ARE A CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF A COMPANY THAT WOULD USE THIS ALL THE TIME BECAUSE THEY ARE ALWAYS IN ACQUISITION OR DEVELOPMENT MODE. ALL THAT CRAZY SHIT ELON DOES THAT PISSES AWAY MONEY WOULD GO RIGHT HERE AS A CREDIT TO THE BUSINESS.

(2) Cash restructuring charges / reserves (capped at 15% of EBITDA) DOWNSIZING, CONSOLIDATION, FURLOUGHING PEOPLE, PAYING TO GET PEOPLE KILLED - IF IT MEANS A CHANGE TO YOUR BUSINESS THAT INVOLVES MOVING PEOPLE AROUND OR GETTING RID OF THEM, YOU CAN ADD IT BACK HERE. SAME GOES FOR CASH RESERVES YOU'VE ESTABLISHED. GET A DOUBLE CREDIT FOR SPENDING **AND** NOT SPENDING MONEY!

(3) Pro forma cost savings projected to be realized from any material business acquisition (exceeding > of $60 million / 1% of total assets) THIS ONE IS ALWAYS FUNNY TO ME. THE IDEA IS THAT IF YOU BUY SOMETHING THAT COMPLEMENTS YOUR EXISTING BUSINESS, EVEN IF IT IS SOMETHING THAT IS ACTIVELY LOSING MONEY, YOU CAN GET A CREDIT FOR THE SYNERGIES IT WILL HAVE WITH YOUR EXISTING BUSINESS. COMBINE WITH ADDBACK (1) ABOVE FOR A REALLY GOO TIME - DOUBLE DIP ON BUYING CASH BURNING BUSINESSES AND JUST TELL PEOPLE IT'S SYNERGISTIC. WOO, FISCAL HEALTH AND WELLBEING!

(4) extraordinary losses PRETTY MUCH WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE. IF SOMETHING FEELS WEIRD TO YOU, YOU CAN PROBABLY ADD IT BACK HERE. THERE IS NO BASELINE FOR THIS. IT'S WHATEVER YOU WANT IT TO BE AT ANY POINT IN TIME AND THE BANK CAN'T STOP YOU.

(5) unusual and/or non-recurring cash charges WHERE YOU CLAIM WRITEOFFS FOR YOUR CEO'S WIFE'S BOYFRIEND'S SECRET FAMILY IN OMAHA'S CHRISTMAS PRESENTS. YOU CAN SERIOUSLY USE THIS FOR WHATEVER YOU WANT AS LONG AS YOU CAN SAY IT'S (I) NOT SOMETHING YOU'D DO EVERY DAY AND (II) IT PROBABLY WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN. INTERESTINGLY SOME BUSINESSES ARE TRYING TO CLAIM CORONA-RELATED CREDITS HERE TO STEER THEM THROUGH THIS EARNINGS SEASON WITHOUT HAVING TO DEAL WITH NEGATIVE EBITDA.

This is just $TSLA, and honestly their definition isn't even that complicated. Seriously - go to your favorite ticker's 10-K, find the credit agreement, and CTRL+F ""Consolidated EBITDA"" and ""Consolidated Net Income"". Try and read it for yourself and tell me if you think that makes up anything other than a shitty madlib - let alone a real performance metric for a business.

Anyway. That's today's post. $LYV breakdown later in the week. $LULU on Friday.

I will get Elon Musk’s face tattooed on me if TSLA finishes above 2500 tomorrow.,2304,ihts49,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ihts49/i_will_get_elon_musks_face_tattooed_on_me_if_tsla/,270,2020-08-28 02:46:57,"Basically as the post says. 

I have a 8/28 2300/2500 call debit spread. Here is [Proof of Position](https://imgur.com/gallery/JqmZlZR) I’m very aware that it’s retarded but I’m betting on TSLA to be at least $500 per share at split. I’m also very aware that I’m retarded for not closing the position today but fuck it yolo. 

If TSLA finishes above 2500 tomorrow I will get a tattoo of Elon Musk on me. I’ll leave it up to you Autists to decide which picture of Elon to get tattooed and will get it permanently put on my body. If TSLA does finish above 2500 and I puss out on getting the tattoo I’ll gladly take the ban.

Edit:
1: I have already been banned and will update after close tomorrow.

2: To clarify (since in the thread) there seems to be some confusion. I will not be getting a tattoo ON my face. What I have proposed is that I will get a tattoo OF Papa Elon’s face on me. Will still get it somewhere that is visible like arms or legs. If you weren’t able to decipher that from the title and by reading the post you’re truly autistic.

Edit 3: It didn’t finish anywhere near 2500. Will now be buying $ROPE. Also thank you u/bukubukuchagamaa and everyone else who gave me awards. They are condolences for me being an absolute idiot and not closing the position at open. Mods can you please unban me?",0.0,2020-08-28,4

This is what will ACTUALLY happen to TSLA and AAPL on Monday open,1749,ijnwc8,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ijnwc8/this_is_what_will_actually_happen_to_tsla_and/,361,2020-08-31 05:53:47,"**Bull reasons:**

* They just got a whole lot cheaper and the average pleb will be all over that shit.
* People FOMO hard from the fuss.
* People have bugs in their algos and they haven't adjusted them for split. When the algos see a super low price they insta buy the fuck out of it.
* Big dogs double down because they have priced in stuff you can't begin to imagine. Oh, and everything is priced in.
* No one dares to short Musk and Cook, because they will get cucked. Again.
* FDs just got cheaper and every retard can afford them. Time to gamble with lunch money.
* Battery day and S&P inclusion for TSLA and ARM based computers from AAPL coming soon.
* If people wanted to lock in gains, they would have done so on Friday.
* StOnKs OnLy gO uP.

&#x200B;

**Bear reasons:**

* The average pleb thinks they've gotten enough tendies from Papa Musk and Tim Apple. They sell it all to lock in gains. Also, that's the 3rd eviction notice and they finally have to pay rent. They cash out.
* Fractional shares already exist for those who wanted cheap AAPL and TSLA. There is no need for the college kids to buy due to lower price.
* Broke af people with just 1 share see an opportunity for liquidity. Before the split, on the one hand, they wanted to lock in gains and on the other hand they didn't want to sell their only share of their biggest winner. Now they can sell part of their position.
* People are expecting them to drop, because they are overextended and we are in a dot com bubble. They sell in order to ""buy the dip"".
* Retard algos auto trigger from unusual activity and sell hard.
* Big dogs are expecting the dip and sell at open driving everything down even further.
* Stocks that split historically underperform initially.
* All the paper hands see a small initial dip for any of the above reasons and they sell off.

"[Update] Lost over $139,985.82 selling naked calls on $TSLA last week",1864,f2z7ft,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f2z7ft/update_lost_over_13998582_selling_naked_calls_on/,378,2020-02-13 03:45:48,"https://i.imgur.com/hVLtoSA.png

Just an update since everyone thinks I'm dead after TSLA went ballistic last week. No, I'm still alive and still selling options on TSLA. 

Sadly I closed those naked calls on Tuesday last week and did not benefit from the the complete reversal on Wednesday. That 69k day loss would have been no loss plus a gain if I were to have held til Friday. However since I was way over leveraged and had negative 113k option buying power that morning, I don't think riding it out would have been a good idea. Shit could have continued up for all I know, and that would have deepened the losses. Life goes on. I could have moped and stayed home, but I actually went out to the gym soon after market close, and then the grocery store afterwards. Still have to eat and workout, even though it was the worst trading day of my life.

The lone Feb 21 $480c was nearly a reverse 100 bagger when I closed it. Quite possibly the WSB record for a reverse bagger, not that anyone would want to break it. Sold for $4.50 credit, bought back in the $410 range I believe ($40k loss on that strike alone).

My goal is to get back to even on the year on TSLA alone. I won't give any updates until I get there (if I do). Similar goal is to get back to positive for the year overall even if I don't quite get there with TSLA. Will provide an end of year update. I'm sure you can get an idea of how I'm doing based on my post/comment volume. I tend to turtle when shit is going bad in order to focus on trading. 

Despite TSLA only moving 0.68% Tuesday 2/11 (yesterday), I happened to capture $11.6k due to the nature of being short vega and benefiting from a drop in volatility:

Let me know if you have any questions or concerns. If you're going through a hard time or similar losses, remember that it isn't the end of the world. It's a blessing and privilege to be able to trade. We once started with nothing. Money comes and goes, and it's not the most important thing in life.",0.0,2020-02-13,6

Operating margins are even worse, down -784bp yoy to 8.2%. Looks like all those price cuts are taking their toll. Not looking too good for TSLA in the EV rat race.

They lost market share in Europe compared to Q3 as well. The Chinese competition has gotten a lot more fierce in Europe lately, so this doesn't bode well for TSLA.
