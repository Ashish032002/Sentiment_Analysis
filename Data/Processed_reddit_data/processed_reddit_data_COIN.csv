https://preview.redd.it/qly1hdzo4fic1.png?width=1398&format=png&auto=webp&s=31a5cd78a346f3c0f568b2e76fc60baa493313ae

But first, let's peel back the curtain and expose the underbelly of my journey. Like many of you, I've tasted the bitter sting of defeat. Cue the dramatic music as I recount the tale of my $387k nosedive in First Republic Bank – a wild ride through bank runs and reversals that left me questioning my sanity and my portfolio.

Fast forward to this year, armed with nothing but a measly 10k and a burning desire for redemption. I kicked things off with some risky moves on Coinbase, doubling my cash to 20k with some spicy weekly puts. Because why settle for crumbs when you can chase those sweet, sweet tendies?

Then, like a hawk eyeing its prey, I kept a close watch on DWAC. With Trump's name plastered all over it and whispers of a merger with Truth Social, I could smell tendies cooking from miles away. When news broke of Trump's triumph in the Iowa caucus, I knew it was time to roll the dice. I scooped up those juicy 35c options faster than you can say ""To the moon!""

At one point, my account ballooned to over $700k – enough to make even the greediest Wall Street fat cat jealous. But did I cash out? Nah, I was too busy dreaming of yacht parties and tendie-filled hot tubs.

[DWAC 3000&#37; gain](https://preview.redd.it/8wcir4mvdjic1.png?width=1199&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a51d063b5a9bb986c43832ff82b737db8889254)

My $700k became $440k but It wasn't until I saw $ARM pumping like it was on steroids that I knew it was time to switch gears.In a move that would make even the bravest of autists sweat, I yoloed my entire 440k into weekly 130 puts when ARM was trading around 155. I was up 50% for short time but didn't sell as my goal was Mil or bust and I ended up with 15% drop EOD, but did I panic? Hell no. Today, I stand before you with a gain of 125%, turning that 440k into a cool 990k!

And for the skeptics out there, feast your eyes upon the snapshot of my trade activities from the past month – undeniable proof that sometimes, just sometimes, even a degenerate gambler can strike gold.

[Trade activity](https://preview.redd.it/4xxl6r55ijic1.png?width=981&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f55c1494d710c16a63e2f250e5705ae98d32ac5)

Now, before you all rush to replicate my miraculous feat, heed my advice: disable margin and options trading ASAP. Trust me, I may have stumbled upon a pot of tendies, but luck can be a fickle mistress.

TLDR: from 10k to 990k – a rollercoaster ride through the highs and lows. 10k to 20k in COIN puts, 20k to 440k in DWAC calls, 440k to 990k in ARM puts.",0.0,2024-02-14,1

I think the easiest way to make money in this game is to short dogshit that is getting pumped up... which leads me to $COIN

Coinbase is up 454% YTD with revenue of $623M, net income -$2.3M with a valuation of $44.5B. Now what is driving this news is a few things: Bitcoin price going up, dismissal of lawsuit against them, hopes around approval of Bitcoin etf and optimism around that space.

Now with full transparency, I am a crypto bear. I don't think it really does anything. It is very useful for transactions which involve crime (hello dark web) but for normal people it does nothing - but people will be either for/against and I'm not going to argue that here... though I see the comments coming in already...

Now the good thing is that this thesis doesn't rely on crypto winning or losing - I have a bear case for this company in any scenario

1. Bitcoin goes to moon with halving, blackrock and fidelity ETFs come on board, Coinbase gets fucked as competitors begin to offer access to crypto with much larger institutional money and better products at lower cost. Coinbase can't compete on margins, can't compete with larger established institutions which sell to their own customers, gets squeezed out by the big financial guys
2. Tether collapses, bitcoin sinks, SEC cracks down, legislative headwinds increase. Crypto is headed into deeper winter and Coinbase is a market selling something nobody wants. Trading volumes drop further and stock sinks like a rock
3. The current situation continues - Coinbase is losing money. The valuation comes back to earth. They cut costs and become a modestly profitable business

454% YTD run up with flat revenues? Gotta come back down to earth. P/E is >100 if you take revenue as PROFIT. Even a pretty neutral outlook on this stock would see it as overvalued. There is no upside for this company.

Shorting NVDA at 740 is literally free money at this point,2295,1aqqfv2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1aqqfv2/shorting_nvda_at_740_is_literally_free_money_at/,1066,2024-02-14 21:35:38,"**Why**

The expectation is that they greatly exceed earnings - so even if they do, the pop won't be anything insane, maybe 6-8% or so. That's probably what's going to happen.

However. If they even slightly falter, then it's going to crater 10-15% at a minimum - I see 650 as a reasonable spot to exit honestly.

I'm just seeing all of the little slots on SoFi that dozens and dozens of people are buying in and it feels like they're lambs being brought to slaughter. Double top, majority of investors only in it for the momentum (which has been waning the last few days), Google's chips, so many reasons for it to fall and for it to fall \_now\_.

I'm a software engineer at an AI startup and yeah I see the insane costs/demand for these but it's a \_hardware\_ company and not software that can scale infinitely at no marginal cost. Now that I think about it, I really think I should've invested in it when I first saw that side of things but now I'm just doing it out of spite. Or that the one other big short I did was COIN from 180 => 150 and this feels the same sentiment-wise. idk either way works

**Positions**

* (-20) NVDA @ 705 - 134% of that account, started on 02-06
* 200 NVD @ 8.95 fifteen minutes ago
* Other more reasonable choices

**Afterword**

Well in the time I wrote this it fell from 740 to 727 so never mind I guess, it's slightly less profitable of a trade but the point still stands (which is left as an exercise for the reader)

**Edit**

**Edit 2**

* Closed NVD @ 9.27

**Edit 3**

* Y'all - It is just money guys and here's the thing: I don't lose when it is worth more than my account (cause it already is). I lose when the *losses* are worth more than my account. Just going to hold through earnings, any losses are offset by the money market interest anyways

**Edit 4**

* NVD is 1.5x inverse NVDA. I did not close the NVDA lol  


**Edit 5**

* My oh my the bullish comments have slowed down! What happened?!? 
* Anyways those were kind of proving my point. The price reflected something like 99% chance of maintaining zero competition and continuing the insane growth for like a decade. That's true that's what it looks like now, and I feel like the underlying facts are going to change soon for its valuation. The price reflected something like a 99% chance of absolutely demolishing earnings and didn't leave a lot of upside for if they even do. 
* Also, I felt like that was the reverse sort of effect happening - only people buying at that level were shorts capitalizing and it's kind of like how we hit a super-bottom in 2022 from margin calls. Shorts have already \*been\* getting wrecked which is why it was a better entry at 740 than say 500.

$COIN: $150B ($570/share) Price Target,530,mr1za6,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mr1za6/coin_150b_570share_price_target/,180,2021-04-15 04:16:01,"TLDR:

* $COIN collects revenue on trading USD VOLUME not asset prices. More trading, buying, *and* selling = more revenue
* Each cycle has introduced a new volume range
* Paypal's and Square's (and Affirm's) valuation indicate the markets are willing to price fintech at large multiples

We can readily compare $COIN against Paypal and Square: they all offer peer-to-peer payment solutions, are involved in the currency space, and offer exchange services. While, PYPL and SQ both offer more established merchant solutions that's not to discredit $COIN's efforts in enabling businesses to accept currency via its 'commerce' service, which could become popular as opinions and usage continue to increase favorably.

$COIN's [Q1 Numbers](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/06/coinbase-reports-estimated-q1-revenue-of-1point8-billion-up-nine-fold.html)

* $1.8 Billion Revenue
* $800 Million Profit
* 56 Million users

Using these numbers, we can approximate the annual numbers:

* $7.2 Billion Annual Revenue
* $3.2 Billion Annual Profit

**This is making 2 quite large assumptions:**

1. Quarterly revenue is not seasonal -- revenues from Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 are approximately equivalent
2. Revenue is *sustained* \-- revenue is not dependent on asset prices, but rather trading volume. More on this later

# Argument for Sustained Revenue

* **$COIN** collects fees on buying *and* selling. If the assets were to suddenly correct, $COIN will still collect fees on the sell side. **We can make a strong claim that $COIN's revenues are primarily dependent on volume, not asset prices**

* **Despite huge volatile corrections, trading volume has entered new ranges with each cycle.**
* **This observation also applies to other assets**

I feel like clarification is needed about Today,80081,laikd0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laikd0/i_feel_like_clarification_is_needed_about_today/,4941,2021-02-02 05:47:47,"There’s a lot of new people on here that don’t really understand the play going on right now on both sides and I felt like we need to clear up some misconceptions so you can make your own decisions. 

**Why no spike today?**:

First of all, we can’t know on what day the Squeeze happens / they cover their shorts. 
All we know is it has to happen sooner or later since the hedgefunds are losing millions if not billions EVERY SINGLE DAY THEY DON’T COVER. 
They use several tactics to delay it, but they can’t circumvent it.
They’re bleeding, and all the retail investors holding are slowly sucking the blood out of their fat ugly bodies.

It might take just a few days, or weeks...
But eventually, when they cover, WE retail investors get to set the price.
That’s why you keep seeing 10k (or 69420$) is not a meme. Because it’s not.

We also know they’re down BAD. Why?
Because they’re attacking us any way they can and wasting millions doing so.

So let’s see what tactics they are using:

**Short ladder attacks**:

What is a short ladder attack? 
The big hedgefunds are putting in lower and lower bid prices between themselves. There is little to no volume on those trades, and since no one can buy, it ""looks"" like the stock is plummeting. It’s only effective if we would sell.

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la6vcb/wall_street_plan_trying_to_psychologically_scare/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

**Infiltrating WSB and other social media**:

Here are some random screenshots I took of WSB Synth. Notice the people saying to jump ship and to take GME gains and invest into FORD. Obvious shills. There’s tons of them. Always new, or old accounts that suddenly post again. All those people came in just in time when the short ladder attacks started, just to make it look like people are panic selling and convince us to sell:

**Manipulating the Media**: 

Here are some News channels caught lying / manipulating the market: (SEC if you read this...)

Now let’s get some clarification on **SILVER:**

There is so much misinformation swirling around concerning Silver. People don’t seem to realize 3 things:

1. **Silver is not a get rich quick move. Silver is a LONG TERM HOLD move.** GME is a risky short term play. So YOU decide what makes more sense to get in right now. (Personally I sold all my stocks to buy GME today. YOLO) 
2. The actual Silver sub on reddit does not advocate buying SLV, nor do most of them believe SLV is the move to make. 
3. The hedge funds would love for you to go all-in on Silver and ignore the GME opportunity. Every dollar spent on SLV instead of GME is a double win for them, since SLV is inverting GME and they own a ton of Silver and that’s why they’re pushing this narrative in the media. 

SLV inverting GME: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la4mog/stop_buying_slv_you_smooth_brained_retards_its/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

The amount of paper contracts or IShares SLV available is basically infinite. Physical silver is a rare physical commodity with a finite supply, and a very low supply of retail sized bars/rounds/coins.

**IF** you want to go into silver for whatever reason, buy physical. But that’s just my retard opinion. 

**SILVER ISN’T “REDDITS NEXT BIG PLAY“.** You guys need to realize the GME situation is very unique and WSB is not, and never was about starting crazy short squeezes. GME is a rare opportunity where the big guys actually fucked up BIG TIME.

Well. Let’s see to what extend they fucked up exactly: 

**Short Version:**
The short version is that a review of the **'strategic fails–to–deliver'** data indicates that institutional insiders may have counterfeited a massive number of Gamestop shares which is why they tried to stop retail investors from buying more shares on Thursday.

There are are **71 million shares** of GME that have ever been issued by the company. Institutions have reported to the SEC via 13F filings that they own more than **102,000,000** shares (including the 13% of GME stock is owned by Ryan Cohen).  That is already 30,000,000 shares more than even exist.

On top of the shares reportedly owned by institutions, retail investors may currently hold 50+ million shares (counting both  long holdings and call options – both ITM and OTM).  

Once you include call options, **retail investors may already hold more than 100% of GME (not just 100% of the float, more than 100% of the actual company)**. This would be definitive proof of illegal activity at the highest levels of the financial system.

Long version here: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9rk78/sec_doj_60_minutes_public_data_suggests_massive/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

**At these levels it’s NOT about the price, it’s about the number of shares in the hedgefunds possession. That’s why they want you to sell so bad.**

I’ve been in crypto for a long time just to trade and have called every single BTC top. I’ve had puts on BTC since 73k (proof: https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/s/ryWIFUSMWV). Check the downvotes. But you know what, this play doesn’t even rely on BTC. Heck it could go to 100-150k for all I care (it won’t) but one thing is for sure: 

COIN is going down. Why? 

1. Their customer service is absolute crap. They only just started phone support after many years and none of them can even speak English 

2. **Every single** fast BTC move results in the exchange being shut down. This has been a problem on their exchange for many years with no fix in sight. **Not a single other major crypto exchange** (Binance/Bitmex/Deribit/etc) has this problem despite having **more** volume than Coinbase 

3. The IV isn’t atrocious like it is on MSTR yet and not many shorts on the stock hence no ensuing squeeze. Most of you regards can actually afford it   

4. Brian Armstrong’s wife has been cheating on him

5. I have puts

6. (And this is probably most important): ETF inflows are slowing down. These ETFs use coinbase for a lot of their higher volume buys. Less volume = less revenue for coinbase

My father was 57 years old, and had a lot of issues. Nobody really thinks about all the good things until someone is gone. My father wasn't a man of means, but during the early stages of my childhood fought hard to provide us an amazing life. And did so without ever really letting us know. 

After a divorce from my cheating bitch of a mother, after multiple back issues, multiple surgeries, and multiple risks to his day to day life, I think he just went downhill. 

I haven't gotten an official answer from the coroner since he's over 3 states away and it's all being communicated mostly through texts with his girlfriend right now, but honestly I'm not sure I want to. 

I came here to say, my father believed in me with all of his being. When I told him I owned 4 shares of  GameStop and that it was way over priced when I bought it, he just told me how proud he was. Pretty convinced he didn't even know what I was saying. But in that same way he believed in me, he believed in every single one of you too. My father would've loved this cause and would've rallied with us till the end.

I had a cool ass dad and you guys all deserve to have a cool ass dad too. He believed in me, and he believed in you too. Whether you're winners, or losers, or damn dirty apes. 

We love you dad. Thank you for believing in us.

Edit: 
1.)Thank you to everyone who has left me their condolences. Believe it or not, I attribute a lot of my ability to move past some of this because of your support. I don't have a great relationship with a lot of other members of my family, and my girlfriend has been great at supporting me through this as well. 

2.) Thank you for all the upvotes, even if you didn't leave a comment. I don't really care about the karma (as I pointed out to a few rude people here), but seeing that so many of you got to read the thread and appreciated my dad the way I did REALLY means a lot. Thank you for that. Also want to point out that I have been taking all of the coins I got from the awards (That I ALSO didn't really care to receive but they manifested nonetheless) and giving out awards to members of this subreddit for all of their devotion to the cause.

3.) I didn't realize I would be the one executing my dad's estate however after I wrote this post I started becoming inundated with calls and text messages from funeral homes, coroners office, investigators, and family members. To anyone who has not gone through this process before I would advise you to have the hard conversation with your parents and ask them what their final wishes are. While my father ( dubbed ""poppawallstreetbets"" by another user here) didn't really have much in that department I believe we have put together an arrangement he would be happy with. We will be having him cremated(which at least that part WAS vocalized), flying out to his home town in Carpenteria, California, and having his Ashes spread along the pacific ocean where he spent his younger years surfing before injuring himself. I have done my best to invite as many of his friends and family as I can. But for anyone in the immediate area, I invite you to attend as we finalize more of the details over the next 2-3 months. 

Again, thank you all for your support. As I see on here frequently, Ape Strong Together. Now let's get to the moon and see my fuckin pops and make him proud!",0.0,2021-02-25,0

$COIN is about to skyrocket and no one is talking about it,0,1d33ost,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1d33ost/coin_is_about_to_skyrocket_and_no_one_is_talking/,68,2024-05-29 09:56:13,"Coinbase ($COIN) is poised for significant growth, supported by favorable market conditions and strong financial performance. The value of Coinbase is closely tied to the performance of cryptocurrencies. In Q1 2024, Coinbase reported a 72% year-over-year increase in revenue, reaching $1.6 billion, with a net income of $1.2 billion. As the primary custodian for Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs, Coinbase benefits significantly from institutional investments, enhancing its profitability.

The approval of Ethereum spot ETFs by the SEC marks a pivotal development. Historically, the approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs led to a 112% increase in Coinbase’s stock price within three months, driven by heightened trading volumes and new user sign-ups. A similar, if not greater, impact is anticipated with the Ethereum ETFs, potentially driving even higher trading volumes and revenue growth.

Imho, two main factors influence COIN prices: the performance of the crypto market, which is currently bullish, and institutional news. While ETF approvals are largely priced in, the ongoing COIN vs. SEC lawsuit is not. Since bitcoin and Ethereum are not security (due to etf approval), chances that Coinbase will win the lawsuit increased (they already filed an appeal to close the case after Ethereum etf approval). We will probably see some news coming from that area in next weeks, leading to upside price action. Additionally, the full impact of the ETH ETF, including increased commissions and ETH staking rewards, has yet to be realized, which could further boost Coinbase's earnings. The next FOMC meeting is expected to be dovish, potentially lifting tech stocks if rate cut announcements occur, further benefiting Coinbase.

Analysts remain bullish on Coinbase, with several setting price targets above $300, reflecting confidence in the company's ability to capitalize on these trends. As institutional adoption of crypto assets continues to rise, Coinbase is strategically positioned to benefit, and retail investors have yet to fully participate.

The other day was chatting to someone who mentioned “no matter what you do in trading in the end it’s no better than a coin flip”. What a great idea … a coin flip trading bot that buys and sells stocks.

To see how a coin flip would actually perform I wrote a coin flip trading bot and backtestested the results since 2016. Since the bot cannot flip a coin I am using

**The Bot**

* Trades only $QQQ (do not ask me why;)
* Randomly enters and exits on 30min intervals
* Places no stop loss
* Always exits EOD

Yo seriously. What the shit would Tesla even need to do for profit in order to even justify it's current valuation???? 1.2t market cap. Amazon is at 1.7t and the most profitable car company rn is Toyota at 300b .......???,5985,qlb35d,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qlb35d/yo_seriously_what_the_shit_would_tesla_even_need/,2078,2021-11-03 00:13:45,"Mind you Walmart is at 400b market cap. So what this means is that Tesla would need to make as much profit as 3 Walmart corporations In the future in order to even justify it's CURRENT market cap. It's actually absurd. It almost seems like people who are investing into Tesla don't really understand what it's current market cap even means... 

I've heard from a Tesla investor that Tesla would become an industry leader like hibachi Ltd.... And once that happens Tesla is going to moon..... And its like dude .. hibachi Ltd market cap is at 50b . Forget about mooning once Tesla becomes an industry leader like hibachi Ltd. Tesla would need to be an industry leader like 20 hibachi Ltd  just to even justify it's current valuation lol.... 

If Tesla becomes the world's most profitable corp like apple. Get this .... You'll justifiably only 2x your money if you invest In it now 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂 . Bruh such a tall order to fill just to 2x . 

Look I get it. Tesla is innovative yadadada yes . The company is still in it's early stages and it'll be better later on. Yes that too. The company is at it's early stages. However, the stock valuation of this company is not. The stock valuation of this company is already at a level where it can swing it's dick around and smack China with it. 

The question is. What would Tesla even need to do.... For profit at a level where it's absurd valuation is justify? 

Another note Toyota is currently the most profitable car company and it's valuation is 300b..... (I'm not saying Tesla is just a car company) Tesla's is already at 1.2t . 4x the most profitable car company already... Without making any profit... Tall order to fill . Let's just say that.




Edit : this is just speculation but hear me out on this Tesla's car margin went up 30% recent quarter ... Now I did some googling turns out Tesla's build quality and assembly is ranked the lowest . So what does this mean? Well it's obvious. This is a very common stock hype strategy. They sacrifice build quality by getting cheap parts and assembly. on paper itll look great for short term profit it's no wonder margin is at 30% then they report it. Boom everyone eats it up HYYYYPPPE. Stock shoots up!! Bruh at this rate Tesla solely survives on hype and elon fucking knows it 😂😂😂😂😂😂 . It's a very obvious stock hype strategy tbh. Do you seriously think this company that is entirely pressured to perform on paper wouldn't go this length? Honestly this is the only thing Elon can do in order to maintain this level of stock price . It's actually a no brainer. Because as soon as that sheet of paper looks bad. Y'all know what's gonna happen. And he knows what's gonna happen. So long as he report good news albeit paper news . All's is well. 

It's a very common tactic for public company in order to showcase short term paper gains. In order to shoot the stock upwards. Some even layoff workers, it's just speculation. But my money is on this.



Edit 2: reading many of the comments , it seems like alot of people are confused that there's actually a difference between  company and stock. Saying that Tesla is a growth stock (disregarding it's current market cap), just because the company is still growing is essentially the gist of many responses. While Not realizing it's already priced in on a veeeerry optimistic note at that. 

Also do people ever stop to think how the hell is this dude gonna monopolize all these different areas of innovation? Amazon focused on 1 thing only , it took them 2decades to reach 1.7t.  and monopolize that one thing . honestly , the ideas are decent ,but what about execution? People invest like all his ideas are already at monopoly level. 

Battery grid, EV cars, AI, spaceX , renewable energy, solar, boring company tunnels, internet grid, something about monkeys , And many more projects. I've heard the argument that Tesla is ""not a car company"" to justify it's current valuation. Like somehow this dude is going to monopolize all these different fields. Ironically If anything EV cars is where he'll most likely have a Monopoly. 


 Saying Tesla is a growth stock just because the company is still growing while it's already at 1.2t marker cap, is the same  as saying GME is a growth stock during MOASS when it's market cap is quadrillions . Just bc "" the company is still growing it hasn't implemented NFTs yet"" .

Edit 3: Also y'all remember when Tesla double in market cap, AKA double it's company's worth (for those who don't understand market cap) ,just because musk boy said ""5/1 split"" 😂😂😂 yo this stock is surreal. Any other company with these kinds of specs , it'll be a no brainer to short. Puts all the way! Not Tesla. Hell fucking no. You think I'm gonna bet against a stock where the company double in valuation just because ""oOoOO it's ""cheap"" now!"" --- (P.S you actually paid more for a smaller piece.) 

 you outa yo goddamn mind if you think I'm gonna go against this kind of retard strength! This is the kind of company that will go up 100b if they announce theyre creating their own gaming console . 0 - 100. From announcement to best case completion price all in a day.",-0.008333333333333331,2021-11-03,0

• The monthly exchange volume of Coinbase has dropped from $145bn in Jan-Mar to $92bn in Apr-Jun (source: The Block), and this would suggest a deterioration in transaction revenues.

• The market capitalisation of the USD stablecoin has fallen from $45bn in January to $27bn at the end of June (source: CoinMarketCap). This could indicate that the interest income it derives from the reserves is falling, even taking into consideration the higher interest rate.

• It is being charged by the Securities and Exchange Commission for operating as an unregistered securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency. It is also charged for the unregistered offer and sale of securities in connection with its staking-as-a-service program (source: SEC). Coinbase are arguing that the SEC lacks the regulatory authority to pursue it, although in the ‘risk factors’ section of their S1 document they noted that they may be subject to litigation by regulators and government authorities.

• Anecdotally, the buzz around crypto at a retail level does not seem to have returned since the heyday of 2021. The business associated with retail trading is far more lucrative compared with that from institutional interest. Furthermore, when student loan repayments recommence in October it could impact retail’s ability to partake.

These factors considered, it may be surprising that the Coinbase share price has risen 155% this year (and over 61% from 12 months ago). Has the share price been driven up by traders, or do investors believe that its prospects are improving? If the former, whether the market cap is $1bn or $100bn is neither here nor there – as they are only concerned with the movement from day to day. If the latter, how patient will investors be – given that the metrics mentioned in the first two points are seemingly heading in the wrong direction?",0.0,2023-07-13,1

$COIN will crash after earnings,99,qnl37x,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qnl37x/coin_will_crash_after_earnings/,213,2021-11-06 02:57:25,"TLDR: Earnings are not going to be good.

Coinbase *seems* like it would be a good play. Earnings last quarter were huge, coin trading is hyped right now, coins are at all time highs, $COIN advertised P/E ratio is very low, etc are all contributing factors to the bull run that $COIN is currently experiencing. Coinbase earnings are releasing the 12th, and it is my opinion that COINBASE earnings will be far lower than expected leading to a large dump.

**Reason 1: Coin prices don't make Coinbase money, but volume does.**

To put things into perspective, I calculated Coinbase's quarterly trading volume in USD. The numbers speak for themselves. (Source: [https://nomics.com/exchanges/gdax-coinbase-exchange](https://nomics.com/exchanges/gdax-coinbase-exchange)):

Q1: $337,726,593,729

Q2: $456,237,466,410

Q3: $324,071,319,552

**Reason 2: Q2 Earnings were great! Or were they?**

Coinbase's Q1 income before taxes was $996,666,000. After taxes was $771,463,000 (-$225,203,000)

Coinbase's Q2 income before taxes was $868,881,000. After taxes was $1,606,349,000 (+$737,468,000)

Using the ratio of Q1 volume/Q1 income = Q3 volume/Q3 income, Q3 income before tax will likely be around 736,403,266 after tax (956,367,877 before).

Using the ratio of Q2 volume/Q2 income = Q3 volume/Q3 income, Q3 income before tax will likely be around 475,226,528 after tax (617,177,309 before).

How did this happen? Coinbase received a one time tax credit relating to their IPO. Notice the 12% drop in income even though volume was up 35%. Following this trend, Coinbase will need a substantial increase in trade volume to see any growth.

**Reason 3: Dilution**

Q1's earning report shows that there were 126,996,000 diluted shares (79,373,000 basic) used to calculate their EPS. Q2's earning report shows that there were 248,147,000 diluted shares (204,728,000 basic) used to calculate EPS. If this trend continues into Q3, the earnings per share data could be disastrous.

**Reason 4: Insider selling**

On November 2nd, the director at Coinbase sold 77,562 shares of $COIN at prices ranging from $326.28-$344.33. The total sold amount was $25,855,002. ~~Insider selling 10 days prior to an earnings report is probably not a good sign.~~  As u[/MilesPower/](https://www.reddit.com/user/MilesPower/) pointed out, this was automatic so it may be completely normal.

This DD will cover everything: fundamentals, Truth Social, ownership, dilution, Trump's holdings and lockup, the future of TMTG, regarded theories and more. You may have seen my [original comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bkvr48/comment/kw10fel/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) (that was stolen and reposted) with a regarded theory about Trump selling shares - **if you can't be bothered to read the full DD, then skip to the end for an updated regard theory of Trump potentially selling shares - now with new information and speculation!**

Before I begin, a quick shoutout to the legend that is u/SPAC_Time. This guy is probably the most knowledgeable person about SPACs i've ever seen, and has been posting excellent information over on r/DWAC_Uncensored, a lot of which is included in this DD. I strongly recommend going and having a look at this sub as it has SO much great information on it. There's loads on there that i've not included in this DD. He's also patiently answered all my questions, so thank you king.

I've been following this since the beginning, and even made an account on Truth Social to see what the bulls are thinking. Honestly some of the shit they come out with over there make the regards on this sub seem like fucking Albert Einstein.

I'll also preface this by saying I have a terrible trading record, mostly crippling losses, so obviously none of this is financial advice and you should ignore everything I say. If anything is incorrect drop a comment below and i'll fix it.

# Overview

You probably already know what this is about, so I won't go into to much detail. Back in 2021, Trump started his own company, TMTG (Trump Media and Technology Group), which owns the social media network Truth Social. It wasn't actually Trump's idea, it was pitched to him, more on this later. The aim is to bring this to the public markets via a SPAC merger with DWAC (Digital World Acquisition Corp). Yesterday shareholders approved the merger, and it's set to complete this merge next week. DWAC has been trading publicly for a few years now, soon the ticker will change to DJT when the merger is finalised.

Before I get into the finer details, here's a quick TL;DR of the bull and bear points for those who will look at this post and say ""i'm not reading all that""

# Bullish

* Trump is a hype machine.
* Something something woke mind virus and free speech
* Truth Social is a soapbox for Trump, and everyone listens to what he says.
* The run-up to the election will generate a lot of hype.
* If Trump wins the election, DJT could trade on hype for a long time
* In theory, if he does win the election, TMTG could become significantly more relevant, leading to an improvement in its fundamentals.
* If the above happens, it's possible TMTG could bring to market their other proposed ventures - a news network and competitor to the existing streaming services.

# Bearish

* The fundamentals are pure dogshit
* If Trump loses the election, it's all over, TMTG will probably go bankrupt.
* Trump could potentially sell shares around the time of the merger.
* DJT will be propped up by just hype, not adequate shareholder equity, which is volatile and unstable.
* The dilution could cause a significant drop in share price if there isn't enough hype to offset it.
* Trump is a serial grifter who's failed at many businesses in the past and screwed over countless customers, investors, suppliers and more.
* SPACs have had a terrible track record in recent years, espeically those with poor fundamantals.
* SPACs are a cheap way to go to market, with the shareholders bearing the cost of this.
* TMTG has no path to profitability in the forseable future. It has not provided any updated business plans, future growth estimates, guidance or updated revenue projections. The entire company feels like it's fake, it is not acting like a normal startup would.
* The other proposed ventures (news network, streaming service) are extremely expensive to get going, we're talking hundreds of millions, even billions of dollars just to get off the ground. As i'll explain later, TMTG *could* have gained the cash to do this through the merger, but unwound it, making these ventures completely unfeasible with the cash DJT will get in this merger.
* Trump is desperate, and backed into a corner. He owes so much money, not just on the recent court judgements, but across his real estate porfolio as well.

Right lets get into the details.

# Truth Social

Currently, Truth Social is the only revenue stream that TMTG has. I don't know if you've been on there at all but it's basically a hive-mind echo chamber of Trump worship.

There's basically 3 types of users:

* MAGA cult
* Bots shilling ED pills and fake gold coins.
* A small number of anti-Trump trolls, posting on every truth Trump does.

I am of the opinion that Truth Social is a completely flawed concept. The concept is that Trump is trying to make a social media network, or ""big tent"", that will be a town-square that is used by everyone - Republicans, Democrats, independents, everyone.

In reality, Truth Social is a social media network hashed together from open source code to spread one-sided propaganda of a presidential candidate. Right off the bat it's a one-sided Trumpfest, and does not make any effort to include anyone other than MAGA.

If Hillary Clinton made a social media network, do you think MAGA would join it? They absolutely wouldn't and this question just highlights their flawed thinking.

You can say what you want about the one-sided nature that the legacy social media networks like Twitter became, but they weren't set up by a political candidate solely to give them a soapbox.

There's also nearly no unique IP behind Truth Social. It's an open-source platform with no unique features. Other than (currently) the only way to hear Trump's thoughts as he takes a shit, it's worthless. It doesn't even live up to it's ""free speech"" claims, as they regularly ban people for arbitrary reasons.

# Fundamentals

Unsurprisingly, the fundamentals of this company are absolute dogshit. This company makes barely any revenue, and has losses in the tens of millions. I can't see how this is going to get any better after merger, and they'll have an $18m SEC fine to pay.

From the balance sheet from the latest revision of the S4 in February:

For the 9 months ended September 30 2023, TMTG made about $3.2m, with an operating loss on that is about $10m.

TMTG claimed that in it's current financial year it projects to make about $17m in revenue, although I can't see how this projection wold be accurate. There's not been any meaningful uptick in users on Truth Social, major advertisers still avoid advertising there, and the other alleged revenue streams that they proposed early on (like a news network and streaming competitor) haven't come to fruition.

# There's barely any cash backing shares of DJT

The shareholder equity of DJT after the merger will be painfully low. After the merger completes, DJT will have access to the money in the trust. This money is essentially the money that DWAC sold the original DWAC shares for when it initially entered the market before it found an acquisition target (TMTG) - about 30m shares at $10/share - so the trust has approximately $300 million in it.

After the merger, DJT will have to pay an $18m fine to the SEC as a result of the investigation which concluded last year.

Ignore the current market value of DWAC shares for a moment. Let's look at how much cash is actually backing each share. Doing a rudimentary calculation (because we don't know exactly how much money DJT will actually get from the trust, or in-depth details of the current liabilities TMTG has): Lets say we take the full value of the $300m trust, minus the SEC fine, and the actual cash backing each share of DJT will be approximately $2.08 per share. This value could be even lower, as legal fees and other operational expenses (like DWAC expenses, and potentially costs of their lawsuits) need to be subtracted from the trust on merger before the cash is released to DJT.

This low cash backing for each share is very low, it's even very low for a SPAC. In the last four years, the average cash backing per share after merge of all SPACs was about $6.67.

Normally, SPACs obtain PIPE (Private Investment in Public Equity) investment during the merger process to offset low cash per share after merge. They specifically do this to ensure the SPAC can meet its operational obligations, and pay all the required costs to bring the merger to market.

DWAC did have a $1.3b PIPE deal set up. This would have given the company an absolute shit ton of money, enough to fund operations for years, and fuel expansion and growth. It would have meant that each share of DJT would have been worth approximately $11.80 - pretty solid cash backing for a SPAC.

However, they completely unwound this PIPE investment. My guess is because they didn't want the extreme dilution that the PIPE would have caused. The PIPE shares were not under lockup, and PIPE investors could have sold immediately on market open after the merger, destroying the share price. They were given a good deal on the shares (it was a percentage below current market value), so likely would have sold for an immediate profit. Remember this part because it works into my regarded theory later on. Spoiler alert: They weren't protecting the retail shareholders by doing this.

# Ownership and dilution - what about the 1 billion shares?

Currently, DWAC is mostly owned by retail. These retail shareholders are somewhat unlike ""normal"" retail shareholders in that they are insanely dedicated. Many of the estimated 400,000 retail shareholders in this will not sell for any reason. Trump could literally dump shit in their faces and they'd probably take it and hold their shares. You could say that this retail holding is stronger than in the average company

After the merger this will all change.

Currently the float of DWAC is about 30m shares.

After the merger, the DJT float will swell to about 135m shares. The majority of these shares will be owned by Trump, currently under lockup for 6 months (more on this later).

There's been lots of talk about 1 billion shares being dumped into the float after merger. This has even been widely circulated in the press, but it's incorrect.

DWAC have *authorised* 1 billion shares, it hasn't *issued* them. This means that in the future, DJT could potentially issue up to 1 billion more shares without having to conduct a shareholder vote or amend the company charter. It's like 1 billion reserve shares sat there if they need it.

It's actually a pretty common thing to do with IPOs and SPACs, many companies authorise shares to be issued later on to raise capital etc.

In any case, if they did issue more shares from this 1 billion amount, it wouldn't be until way after the merger.

There will, however, be significant dilution on merge. On business completion, up to 8,369,509 shares will be dumped into the float, given to holders of TMTG convertible notes. These shares will not be locked up like other insider shares, and can be sold immediately after merge. The holders of these notes will likely do this because they'll immediately realise a 400%+ gain. This is significant dilution, and could cause a huge drop in share price, unless insane Trump mania causes a hype rally to offset it. Much of the rest of the float is potentially (foreshadowing here) locked up, but this 8m share dump is significant.

# Trump hype

The hype surrounding trump is real. We've seen it many times before with DWAC - the insane rally to $175/share was surreal. It's plummet after was equally unreal.

The hype has the potential to offset everything - shitty fundamentals, insane dilution and more. It's the reason DWAC has traded so far away from reality in terms of an accurate valuation.

I'm sure you all saw this post about the hype, that led to you all pumping up the price of the OP's contracts by like 800% before he sold most of them:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bikpfj/these\_calls\_could\_be\_500\_baggers\_turn\_1000\_into/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bikpfj/these_calls_could_be_500_baggers_turn_1000_into/)

The first takeaway from the above DD is that the hype is fucking insane, and supersedes everything, can cause the share price to rocket to the moon regardless of anything else.

I agree with this. It's possible that there will be a huge buying demand to offset the dilution on merge. DJT could rally to the fucking moon.

The other is the theory that Trump will shill DJT and all his MAGA cult will all rush to buy in.

This theory i'm not convinced on. Much of his cult have no idea how to trade shares, many of them are braindead and can barely read. And if you think that they'd buy shares anyway, think about this:

Trump has literally been on-stage at rallies in front of tens of thousands of his most die-hard supporters, and directly shilled Truth Social to them and they *still* haven't rushed to join. And Truth Social is a zero-barrier, free to use social media network specifically set up for them.

I personally don't think we'll see millions of MAGA pouring into the market to buy DJT. Any MAGA who already know how to trade will be holding shares of DWAC already.

# Regarded Trump selling theory - now with updates!

Now it's time for the juicy stuff - the regarded speculative theory on Trump selling shares.

Disclaimer: This is a regarded theory that probably won't happen, obviously i'm jumping to conclusions not necessarily found in hard evidence. If it does happen, though, I expect to be awarded a flair from the mods.

It's widely understood that Trump has a lockup on his shares for six months after the merger.

There is, however, a clause that undermines this.

In the [latest revision of the S4](https://app.quotemedia.com/data/downloadFiling?webmasterId=90423&ref=318071075&type=HTML&symbol=DWAC&cdn=7df8a564ed5159633ce6abd5829662e5&companyName=Digital+World+Acquisition+Corp.&formType=S-4%2FA&formDescription=%5BAmend%5D+Registration+of+securities%2C+business+combinations&dateFiled=2024-02-14), filed in February, on page 42, it reads:

>Lock-Up. **Unless waived by Digital World prior to the Closing**, key stockholders of TMTG (including its management team) agreed to be subject to a six-month lockup in respect of their Digital World common stock, subject to certain customary exceptions, which would provide important stability to the leadership and governance of TMTG.

This means that, at any time before the merger closes, DWAC could waive Trump's lockup for some or all of his shares. Further to this, they could do it before it was disclosed publicly. Trump could even sell shares for several days before it would be publicly known by DJT issuing its first 8K approximately 4 days after the merger, or Trump filing a Form 4 to disclose the sale.

As mentioned in my previous comments, I theorise that Trump could potentially dump some or maybe even all of his shares, potentially even destroying the company and allowing him to walk away with billions. He could then just go back to X to continue to be able to reach an audience far bigger than on TS.

Remember when Trump met with Elon earlier this month, and everyone thought it was to do with Elon donating to Trump's campaign? Wrong. I theorise that they were doing a mutually-beneficial deal:

Elon agrees to ensure Trump never gets banned from X under any circumstances, ensuring he always has a soapbox.

Trump agrees to return to X, giving Elon a huge bump in viewers.

Trump dumps a load of his shares, pays his legal bills, makes a shit ton of money, gets a much bigger audience on X compared to Truth Social. It's a win win for both of them.

**Additionally, I theorise that DWAC unwound the PIPE deal not for retail shareholder benefit, but to avoid Trump's shares from dropping in value so he could sell them at a higher price after merge. DWAC never issued a reason publicly as to why they unwound the PIPE. Unwinding the PIPE is seriously detrimental to the core of the business itself. It means significantly less cash to fund operations for a company that makes yearly losses in the tens of millions with no path to profitability.**

The company will get under $300m of cash, rather than nearly $1.6bn it would have gotten with the PIPE deal + initial $300m share offering by DWAC. I'm yet to hear a reasonable explination as to why DWAC would unwind the PIPE.

Something else to consider: once DJT comes to market, DWAC is essentially liquidated. It ceases to be a company, the board is dispanded and no longer work for DWAC, it's shares are swallowed up by DJT. It is **DWAC** that could waive the lockup. If shareholders were furious - would they even be able to sue a company that no longer exists? Would they even be able to join together to file an expensive lawsuit against DWAC?

The counters to the above tin-foil hat theory are:

""But Trump wouldn't need to sell, he could just borrow against his shares""

I'm not convinced about this for several reasons. Firstly, what sane lender is going to lend up shares that are under lockup for 6 months. They wouldn't be able to force Trump to sell his shares to repay the debt for up to 6 months if he defaulted on the loan. Secondly, TMTG is basically worthless, with barely any shareholder equity as described above...his shares aren't worth anything and have barely any cash backing them. Lenders will want solid fundamentals before lending against shares, they aren't gonna lend him half a billion $ on shares that are propped up on hype. He recently went to more than 30 surety companies recently to try and get a loan to pay his bond, and all of them turned him down. None of them would accept real estate or non-liquid assets as collateral.

[Reuters is also reporting](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/investors-greenlight-trumps-6-billion-social-media-deal-2024-03-22/) that he can't borrow against them due to previous terms he's agreed to:

>It is unclear how and when these cases will be resolved. Even if the  deal gets completed next week, Trump will not be allowed to sell any of  his shares in the combined company for six months **or borrow against them**, based on terms he previously agreed.

He likely wouldn't be able to borrow against his shares even if his restriction was lifted.

""The board wouldn't allow it""

Go look at who the board of DJT is made up of: Trump, his sons and some of his closest yes-men. He basically controls the board. The DWAC board is made up of Trump yes-men as well. The fucking SEC investigation was specifically about how Trump colluded with DWAC without disclosing it publicly.

""Why would Trump destroy his own company?""

Because said company is basically worthless. It has a high share price now based on hype, but it's going to take A LOT of work to get it generating revenue and profit. When the hype dies down, the share price could plummet, reducing hes unrealised net worth. If he loses the election it's all over, and if he hasn't sold by that point he'd lose BILLIONS. Institutional investors won't be touching this, so there won't be a solid foundation of ownership.

Trump looks out for himself, and he's backed into a corner. Dumping his entire holding of DJT would literally solve all of his monitary issues - court judgements, mortgage/lease payments on his properties, funding of his campaign and more.

""But he's screwing over his base""

Obviously there's a risk here, in that dumping his shares on his cult could cause a significant backlash, and he needs every vote he can get going into an election. However current DWAC shareholders are a tiny percentage of his base. If he dumped his shares on them, the majority of his base probably wouldn't even know about it. I'm not even convinced they'd turn on him either, they are literally in a cult. Remember when he said this back in 2016: ""I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn't lose any voters, OK?"". Still rings true today.

Trump is desperate. NY is about to start seizing his assets, potentially within days. I can't imagine him choosing TMTG over Trump Tower for example, especially when he could potentially liquidate his entire holding of TMTG for an immediate gain of several billion cash.

# What's going to happen after merger?

Honestly...who fucking knows. It could absolutely shit the bed due to dilution even if Trump doesn't sell shares.

Or the hype of Trump could propel the share price into the stratosphere.

EDIT: Forgot to add in the next step which will be the ticker changing from DWAC to DJT. The earliest this could happen is Monday. However an actual date hasn't been announced yet, so it could be Tuesday or Wednesday, or even later towards the end of the week.

I could, and probably will be, wrong about all of this. Be sensible and don't trade this merger.

Have fun regards.

I analyzed last 15 years of news articles to see how many times Michael Burry predicted a crash and how many times he turned out to be right! Here are the results.,5541,oawsxf,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oawsxf/i_analyzed_last_15_years_of_news_articles_to_see/,1255,2021-06-30 18:28:42,"**Preamble:** Michael Burry is definitely a controversial figure. He rose to fame betting against the subprime mortgage market and making a 489% return for his investors between Nov’00 and Jun’08 (SP500 returned just 3% in the same period).

But, I recently observed that in every news article/tweet, he always talks about an impending crash. As recently as last week, he issued another warning stating that there would a “mother of all crashes soon due to the meme-stock and \*\*\*\*\*currency rally that will approach the size of countries”. Basically, what I wanted to analyze was

**Whether Michael Burry always predicts a crash and gets lucky when there is an actual crash or does his prediction actually turns out to be true most of the time?**

**Analysis**

The various news articles spanning over the last 15 years were obtained from Google News \[1\]. I flagged the date of each crash prediction and then analyzed the performance of the market/stock over the

a. Next 1 Month

b. Next 1 Quarter

c. Till Date

I will not be including the subprime mortgage crash prediction in this analysis as we all know how that turned out and how that made him famous. Also, there are no news reports covering Burry before that.

The performance figures are calculated based on the prediction. If Burry specifies a stock, then I am using that particular stock as the benchmark. If its broader prediction relating to the overall market, then the benchmark used is S&P 500.

**Results**

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/y2bct7sphe871.png?width=1028&format=png&auto=webp&s=0dd6d0b6163ad7ed0bfc917af373ce9f65bce71d)

There was a long gap of 9 years after the 2008 crash where Burry stayed out of the public view and did not make any warnings or predictions about the market.

His first verifiable prediction after the 2008 crisis [came in May 2017](https://www.lombardiletter.com/michael-burry-stock-market-crash/10895/) where he warned that we can expect a global financial meltdown and World War 3. In his exact words

>I didn’t go out looking for this, I just did the math. Every bit of my logic is telling me the global financial system is going to collapse

But it’s been 4 years since the prediction and the market is chugging along just fine. S&P500 has returned a respectable 93% to date and there is [no imminent threat](https://thebulletin.org/doomsday-clock/timeline/) of a World War happening.

Burry’s next prediction was in [Sep 2019](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/the-big-short-s-michael-burry-explains-why-index-funds-are-like-subprime-cdos-1.1310874) where he said that index funds are the next market bubble and are comparable to subprime CDOs. He said that index fund inflows are now distorting prices for stocks and bonds in the same way that CDO purchases did for subprime mortgages more than a decade ago. He said the flows will reverse at some point, and “it will be ugly” when they do.

This prediction also did not pan out as S&P500 has returned 50% to date over the last two years and the only crash that occurred during this period was the Covid-19 flash crash from which the market made a sudden recovery.

Burry’s next target was on Tesla where he said that Tesla’s stock price is [ridiculous](https://www.businessinsider.in/stock-market/news/big-short-investor-michael-burry-reveals-hes-short-tesla-tells-elon-musk-to-issue-more-stock-at-its-ridiculous-price/articleshow/79538731.cms) and that it would [collapse](https://www.businessinsider.in/stock-market/news/big-short-investor-michael-burry-predicts-tesla-stock-will-collapse-like-the-housing-bubble-enjoy-it-while-it-lasts/articleshow/80171258.cms) like the housing stock bubble. I have kept both the articles there which had only one month difference as we don’t know exactly when he shorted the stock. The returns would be substantially different if he did it in Dec’20 when compared to Jan’21 as Tesla had a phenomenal run in December.

He [reiterated](https://www.businessinsider.in/stock-market/news/big-short-investor-michael-burry-warns-the-stock-market-is-dancing-on-a-knifes-edge-and-fears-hes-being-ignored-again/articleshow/81154288.cms) again on Feb’21 that the market is dancing on a knife’s edge and he is being ignored again. He felt the boom in day traders due to the meme stock mania and the increasing cash flow to the index trackers would cause a massive bubble. This prediction also hasn’t turned out to be right as the market has returned 11% to date over the last 4 months.

Burry’s only prediction that we can say confidently was right after the 2008 mortgage crisis is that he called [\*\*\*coin a speculative bubble](https://moguldom.com/340499/michael-burry-who-predicted-2008-mortgage-crash-says-bitcoin-is-a-speculative-bubble-sends-prices-lower/) in March’21. \*\*\*coin has since dropped 28% in around 3 months. Even in this case, we don’t have enough data to showcase how this prediction would turn out over the next one/two years.  

Burry was most active in 2021 making the most number of predictions with the latest in Jun’21 stating that we are currently in the [greatest speculative bubble of all time](https://moguldom.com/358632/investor-michael-burry-who-predicted-2008-subprime-mortgage-crisis-says-this-is-greatest-speculative-bubble-of-all-time-in-all-things/). Only time will tell how this one will turn out!

**Conclusion**

I have immense respect for Michael Burry and his skills. He was a doctor and worked as a Stanford Hospital neurology resident and then left to start his own hedge fund that became [extremely successful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Burry). But, as you can see from the above analysis, he is more often wrong than right with his predictions \[2\].

But, the stock market rewards predictions disproportionately \[3\]. Out of the 100 predictions you make, even if you get 99 wrong but get one extremely unlikely event right your overall returns will still be extremely high.

The key point here is that if you believe in Michael Burry, you will have to follow all of his recommendations \[4\] and not pick and choose what you feel comfortable with as most of the returns would be from an extremely unlikely scenario.

They tell you they’re gonna fool you, and then they do it –* ***James Randi***

[Jason Zweig](https://twitter.com/jasonzweigwsj), author of *Your Money and Your Brain* and editor of Benjamin Graham’s *The Intelligent Investor* highlighted three ways to make money:

*1) Lie to people who want to be lied to, and you’ll get rich.*  
*2) Tell the truth to those who want the truth, and you’ll make a living.*  
*3) Tell the truth to those who want to be lied to and you’ll go broke.*

There is a massive audience for No.1 and that’s what you see with the “Top 10 tech stocks to buy now” or “Secret stock picks of billionaires” posts popping up every day on your feeds. People want to believe in the impossible – that they will be able to beat the market by following a financial guru or that riches are just one stock pick away.

During the war in Yugoslavia, two professions were in high demand: soldiers and fortune-tellers. Given that we might be moving into another tough year for the stock market with high inflation, a looming recession, and ever-increasing interest rates, investors will be looking towards these “experts” more than ever to tide them over the rough times. Don’t believe us? Right now, there are more than 1 million paid subscribers to [Motley Fools](https://www.fool.com/premium/stock-advisor/)’ stock advisory service and \~[20 Million monthly visitors](https://www.similarweb.com/website/thestreet.com/#overview) to Jim Cramer’s TheStreet website.

There is an endless supply of stock pickers out there and Jim Cramer is arguably the most famous one! So, it’s only fair that we put his stock picks to the test.

### Jack of all trades

An equity research analyst usually covers at most 10-15 companies annually and issues directional calls every quarter. But, Cramer has made an incredible 21,653 stock picks \[1\] over the past 7 years averaging close to 3,000 calls per year. He was making more than 20 stock picks per episode of his show. We can clearly see the classic bullish bias on the calls made by Cramer with 74% of the picks in the buy/positive mention.

https://preview.redd.it/pcumogafngba1.png?width=513&format=png&auto=webp&s=faaf634d7be0b08b4156ab3aa062120d4cf92d99

One concerning behavior exhibited by Cramer is how frequently he changes his mind. Consider the case of Netflix. He ended 2021 by stating Netflix is a buy but then changed his tune after just a month. Once again in March, he said that it was a buy and then changed it to a sell rating just 2 weeks later. Consistently following his calls would be a nightmare for even the most seasoned stock trader!

https://preview.redd.it/kpkk3v7gngba1.png?width=444&format=png&auto=webp&s=fdd57b04acc06b064eb8471eb08b951179f2710c

Since Cramer frequently contradicts his own picks, we are only evaluating the short-term performance *(up to a month)* of his calls \[3\]. 

### Cramer’s Performance

Surprisingly, if you had followed Cramer’s picks to the T, you would not have lost money. On average his buy recommendations went up by 0.87% after a month and his sell recommendations went down by 0.15%. One possible explanation for the brief outperformance is that Cramer’s Mad Money has more than 200K viewers – even if 1% decide to act on his stock tip, it’s big enough to move small stocks. This phenomenon is well-studied and is known as the [Cramer Bounce](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cramerbounce.asp).

&#x200B;

>*In January 2009, graduate students from the University of Pennsylvania published a study claiming that over time, the average* ***next-day increase*** *for a stock that Cramer recommended was* ***3% for the entire study sample****, and almost* ***7% for smaller cap stocks.****They proved through the use of electronic communication networks (ECN) that most trades came in after 7 p.m. ET, when ""Mad Money"" concluded.*

https://preview.redd.it/2amdlsbsngba1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=49e9804a5ad74dd1fc29a9e512addfb570b8a706

While his standalone performance looks good, it’s a completely different story if you pit him against the market (S&P 500). Except for the 1-day buy recommendations, you would have **gotten a better return just investing in the market every single time.** Another fascinating insight is that his performance worsens as we increase the time horizon \[4\]. 

https://preview.redd.it/8dmossmyngba1.png?width=958&format=png&auto=webp&s=88310aba5e6bdcc0833f31d143ccec3c9cfc7cd0

Finally, we all know how easy it is to pick winners in a bull market \[5\] and next to impossible to do the same in a bear market. There was so much money flowing in the system that [monkeys and goldfish were beating the market](https://marketsentiment.substack.com/p/the-monkeys-that-beat-the-market) and we were trading [images of rocks](https://marketsentiment.substack.com/p/nft) for actual houses. But, the party came to an end in 2022 with the Fed raising their interest rates at the fastest pace in recent history. **So how did Cramer perform in 2022 \[6\]?**

All his buy and positive mentions lost money across all time periods! His buy recommendations on average went down 3% in just one month and positive mentions were down 5%. To add salt to the wound, if you had invested in the market instead of Cramer’s calls, you would have scraped by with a \~1% return!

https://preview.redd.it/5t63rpf4ogba1.png?width=1416&format=png&auto=webp&s=f8aa8e861b639b279db3057a858512bde3c5b1df

### The best & worst calls by Cramer

Even a monkey throwing darts at a chart will be able to pick some successful plays. Cramer has made more than 20K calls and some are bound to work out incredibly well. Here are the top 5 best buy and sell calls made by Cramer. Two of the picks that stand out are the buy rating given to Moderna during the vaccine rally in Jul ’21 and the sell call for the Norwegian Cruise line just before they closed the cruise ships due to Covid. He timed both of them to perfection – We’ve got to give credit where credit is due!

https://preview.redd.it/vgwc86a5pgba1.png?width=1109&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b4b4a77a3482918265e039ae978c9427b17bc4d

On the other side of the coin, Cramer issued a buy rating to EPR properties & Toll Brothers just before the Covid crash. Both stocks tanked more than 70% in just over a month. During the same time, his worst sell recommendations (Sunrun and Novovax) ended up doubling in just under a month!

https://preview.redd.it/hv4zpf7qogba1.png?width=1279&format=png&auto=webp&s=146799c1358f1c45ea012c568b91310b8406a7ee

His picks were so bad that there are now [accounts that track his calls](https://twitter.com/CramerTracker) and even an [Inverse Cramer ETF](https://www.wealthmanagement.com/etfs/fund-helped-investors-bet-against-cathie-wood-taking-jim-cramer#:~:text=The%20Inverse%20Cramer%20ETF%20would,appearances%2C%20according%20to%20the%20filing.) that aims to provide investment results by doing the opposite of Cramer’s investment advice.

### Heads I win, tails you lose

>*Show me the incentive and I’ll show you the outcome:* ***Charlie Munger***

In the end, we believe that all of us give undue importance to stock-picking influencers – We should all see Cramer for what he is – an entertainer. He does not care about the performance of his stock picks because that’s not how he makes his money. He makes his living by entertaining his audience week after week. His only job is to have a strong opinion – and he does that well.

The final nail in the coffin is how Cramer’s own portfolio has performed. He claimed to have a ""*rate of return of 24% after all fees for 15 years*"" for his hedge fund until he retired, but his performance was [never independently verified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Cramer). For the portfolio for which the performance was publicly available, researchers at [Wharton found](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/568f03c8841abaff89043b9d/t/5734f6e2c2ea51b32cf53885/1463088868550/HartleyOlson2016+Jim+Cramer+Charitable+Trust+Performance+and+Factor+Attribution.pdf) that

I guess that just about sums up everything I had to say!

***Data used in the analysis:*** [***here***](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yr3CnKWRf-CUlJajsM6W9E-CB5Y0hXGu/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=111668650548288730122&rtpof=true&sd=true)

**Footnotes**

***\[2\]*** Data is obtained from the [Mad Money website](https://madmoney.thestreet.com/screener/index.cfm?utm_campaign=Top%20stocks%20of%20the%20week%21%20&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) & [Quiver Quant](https://www.quiverquant.com/cramertracker/). We then adjusted for US stocks that are currently trading.

\[3\] For those who are interested to know how the returns are calculated

* 1-day returns are based on the difference between closing and opening price the day after Cramer made his prediction
* 1-week and 1-month returns are calculated using the adjusted closing price
* Returns are capped at the 99th Percentile so that a few outliers don’t skew the trend

\[4\]  Which were once again validated by [external studies](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cramerbounce.asp)

>*This abnormal increase lasts for only about 12 days, whereupon the stock's price retreats back to its pre-recommended price, assuming no other news has been released*

*\[5\]* 2016 to 2021 was predominantly a bull market with only the brief Covid drop in between.

\[6\] Cramer’s website stopped updating the stock picks after Jul’22. We had to scrape the rest of the data and cannot be certain that we are capturing 100% of his picks. But, the sample size of 1,456 picks that he made in 2022 should be more than enough to give the analysis statistical significance.

So here is the thing. I’ve been doing a lot of reading and listening on the topic of crypto, and it made me realize 2 things 

1. After the bitcoin halving, which btw is meant to be on 4/20, the yearly yield of bitcoin will be less than gold. This, for the highly regarded, means it’s going to be RARE. 

Rarity = scarcity
When something is scarce = demand 
demand = price go up ( big green )

2. Bitcoin follows a power law (picture of the graph)
For us regards, this means that bitcoin follows a trend line that is generated using functions of mathematical formulas. Not by human hands!
These lines have been very well respected by bitcoins price over the 15 year period. 
The way in which the accuracy of these lines can be measured is based on regression ( the r^2 number ). In the case of bitcoin and  this model, that number is .953, which means that it is 95.3% accurate. To add to this, the power law graphic of bitcoin has been the most accurate example so far… out of any asset that has had power law applied to it. 

So why ramble about all this on here, and how does this relate to coinbase. Well if you look at the graph, we are very likely to expect a price of 150-200k in a years time,and a million in about 10. The reason I don’t believe that bitcoin is some sort of trend that will die out soon is because of the recent ETF adoptions of bitcoin. It’s here to stay. 

Coinbase is considered one of the biggest exchanges worldwide, second to Binance globally and 1st in the US. When it comes to users, it is second it Binance with a difference of 30 million, however it is a lot more user friendly when it comes to new users. With this information, imagine what is going to happen when bitcoin breaks all records and will go on to be talked about everywhere. The newbies are going to flock to coinbase and dump their savings into it, convincing their whole family to buy in at the family gatherings. 
Boomers are going to flock to the soon to be run, all through coinbase with its user friendly interface

Coinbase is a better platform for users who are simply looking for an easy place to buy and sell crypto, and those with simple trading requirements that don't need a wide range of trading tools. https://www.coinbureau.com/review/binance-vs-coinbase/#

To conclude. This is quite a long term play. Considering the -20% drop over the past couple days, and the halving coming up by the end of this week, it may be a good time to jump in. 

I’m full porting this one.
Best of luck my fellow regards. May your accounts be green and lambo’s in coinbase blue. ",0.0,2024-04-16,1

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

1.) COVID vaccine rollout has started, and we will be able to attend movies soon. The Biden Administration (sorry for getting political, just pls keep reading) has an ambitious plan (100 million vaccines in 100 days or whatever the fuck) and this pandemic is almost over. I’d give it until the end of the year.

2.) **Most** [**AMC**](https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/ct-ent-movie-theaters-reopening-0123-2021) **theatres** [**are open**](https://www.amctheatres.com/amc-safe-and-clean#locations) or they are planning to open soon with social distancing and mask measures in place. They will shut down the food services and concessions, but they are coming back.

3.) **Consumers have a sentimental connection to movies. They will come back**. People are starved for the outside world and will come out in massive hordes to watch movies. People will go out and see movies, take their kids, go on dates, etc. Nothing can replicate the experience of a giant screen and surround audio.

4.) This major influx of blue balled movie goers will cause a major boost in 2021. Then we will see a continuation of the year over year growth we have been seeing since 2012.

5.) The AMC business model is working. The revenue has steadily increased since 2012 year over year. [**In 2012, they made $811 million. In 2019, they made $5.47 billion.**](https://www.statista.com/statistics/206959/revenue-of-amc-theatres/) There has been a steady rise. **THEY ARE NOT IN DECLINE.**

6.) I understand they have many loans, but it is something that can be paid off in a few years with the help of their parent company, Wanda Entertainment, and increased profits in 2021.

7.) They will not go bankrupt. WANDA entertainment, a Chinese company owns the plurality share (20%) and will bail them out if it is necessary. They bought for $2.6 billion in 2012, and have seen a ROI, scoring $2.7 billion in 2013, the year immediately after their purchase. AMC is too good of an asset for Wanda to lose them. Also, AMC can take advantage of new stimulus and other government assistance programs.

8.) It’s extremely cheap right now because everybody is shorting, and there’s a pandemic. Corona is only temporary. Everybody thought GameStop was going to go under, until we showed them. Remember that.

9.) If there is interest or heightened trading in the stock, AMC can dilute shares and sell them to help finance operations and pay debt, using stock sales as leverage. AMC just did this today, and they can do it again if needed.

10.) AMC will not go bankrupt, not only because of the potential Wanda bailout, but [**they also raised $917 million today. They have enough runway to stay operational the end of the year. ""Bankruptcy is off the table for now.""**](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/01/25/amc-ceo-adam-aron-on-917m-financing.html) (We should be able to return to theatres by then.) A slight majority of this new liquidity comes from issuing new shares, as described in 9. They are also planning to do debt/equity swaps, so those who take out debt can hold shares in the company, and AMC won't get fucked over by high loan payments.

11.) [**AMC is about 70% shorted**](https://www.highshortinterest.com/)**, there is much potential to cause a squeeze**. However, there are still many more reasons to invest in AMC beyond a simple short squeeze.

12.) AMC does very well when it is not pandemic. $5.4 billion in revenue last year, and there will be many movies, as well as many moviegoers that come out after the pandemic. Especially with major franchise movies, which have been delayed. They [have also reached a deal with Universal, which allows Universal to do home releases earlier, but stipulates they must be in theatres for 17 days before that.](https://variety.com/2020/film/news/universal-amc-deal-theaters-pandemic-1234801134/)

13.) AMC is only $12 a share right now... Even if it loses, you’re only going to lose a bit. Meanwhile, the ceiling is high, and there is much potential. If you want in, do it now while it's cheap. People keep talking about how dumb it is to buy during the pandemic, but this is the point of largest potential. Don't wait for the recovery to buy.

14.) AMC used to trade at $10 before the pandemic. Let’s keep it at its former glory. AMC deserved a $1bn market cap and they got one. They will probably hit $20 tomorrow (predicting $25 by Feb1, peak in summer with COVID all done.).

15.) Even though the Net income is negative and they lose money, it consistently stays in the hundred thousands range, and it does not lose that much. Any autist on here from GME could pay the difference. [**AMC has also increased gross profits year over year, from 2,004,200 in 2016, to 3,493,200.**](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/amc)

*(The rest of these bullet points are just jokes, so feel free to skip if you want.)*

16.) Without AMC there’s no place to spend my AMC points, and there better be a place for me to spend those points because I invested my entire life savings into those damn AMC stubs.

17.) Going to the movies was my childhood. We must save my childhood. DO NOT LET AMC DIE. Save AMC.

18.) You can take ur wife and her bf to the movies when this is over.

19.) The AMC food court literally sells tendies. (But we should call AMC tendies popcorns instead.)

20.) **STONCCS only go up.**

21.) you guys are all retard who cannot think for themselves and will do whatever is echoed in this fucking internet cave.

TL;DR : AMC has done a great job with fundraising and can survive until the end of the year. Vaccine rollout has started, and recovery is coming soon. People are due to return to movies. About 70% of shares are shorted, so we can potentially trigger a squeeze.

# Pandemic recovery & squeeze combo.

Today I will do a Technical analysis on several charts showing how the dollar will rockets, gold and stocks will crumble, even oil and fake internet coins will crumble further. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to make fortunes because quite frankly its not everyday we see multi decade technical patterns break out unless your living until your a 100

to start things off, everyone knows a high dollar is bad for stocks and every asset you buy since their value is pegged to the dollar (even your fake internet coins). What if I told you the value of the dollar is about to increase by about 50% 

[Right here we have about a 50 year wedge that did a fakeout in the 2000's to the downside then pumped and broke out in 2015 and has been concolidating a double bottom since which just broke out two months ago. The price target of the wedge would indicate about a 75&#37; move up, which about 60&#37; of which is left to happen.](https://preview.redd.it/1evhipxyl5791.png?width=1385&format=png&auto=webp&s=c27c94447ec2f4b85f8195b013ce0ada0ea011b0)

Things to note is that above is a MONTHLY chart meaning these things take years so I estimate 1-2 years of pumping dollar which mean everything else will go down in value

Second up is gold, your average idiot believed gold is the way but gold is painting nasty patterns and has been on a decline since the year started

[over here we can see the red mini double top spanning about 2 years, once that green line breaks itll fall and the PT is about 30&#37; to that red channel, However, it is within a massive almost 12 year double top which has a PT that is about 70&#37; down from here](https://preview.redd.it/cenhaf1in5791.png?width=1411&format=png&auto=webp&s=1df2a122e634eacd292dedcda64f2d478f39897f)

The UVXY has been getting coiled down and big money tried to ban it like 2 months ago because its ""risky"" which sounds like when they tried to ban GME. Its gonna go parabolic once this all starts to move

[This is an asset that should be going to zero and constantly down over time however over the past year it has been sideways forming a reversal pattern on large consolidating volume.

Normally and historically UVXY flies about 1000% but I think this time will be much more because of this coiling. Yesterday on closure it moved significantly up with that small move we got from spy so the suppressing is done and it'll moon going forwards. \* this is a chart another reddit user pointed out to me and I dont take credit for it so thank you u/anh423

I will not cover fake internet coins because those are banned, current positions are 3 September $30 UVXY contracts because I had no money because of my gambling addiction and I am getting laid off in 3 weeks. I got those contracts last week and hasnt opened my portfolio since because I dont want to know how much I lost so far as seeing causes emotions which in turn puts dents in my diamond hands. Im hoping to make 1000-5000% on them then ill short the vix top with spreads ITM for an easy 300% or so which should  give me a sum i can survive on until finding another job (the uvxy play is not mine as stated above) The reason I also believe this dump will trigger UVXY is because everything will go down, stocks, crude, gold and heck even the all reliable trustworthy digital real estate will be hit

&#x200B;

TDLR: everything is gonna go down and im getting fired in 3 weeks, not financial advise (obv) lol but yea 3 contracts in September, charts are all monthly so yes technically yearly leap contracts would’ve been smarter and trying to time the market is retarded I know

Elon Musk sued for $258 billion over alleged D*g* coin pyramid scheme,110,vdwdyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vdwdyw/elon_musk_sued_for_258_billion_over_alleged_dg/,99,2022-06-17 02:54:17,"As per Reuters NEW  YORK, June 16, Elon Musk was sued for $258 billion on  Thursday by a D\*\*\*coin investor who accused him of running a pyramid  scheme to support the cryptocurrency.

In a complaint filed in federal court in Manhattan, plaintiff Keith Johnson accused Musk, electric car company Tesla Inc [(TSLA.O)](https://www.reuters.com/companies/TSLA.O)  and space tourism company SpaceX of racketeering for touting D\*\*\*coin  and driving up its price, only to then let the price tumble.

Musk is CEO of both Tesla and SpaceX.

""Defendants  were aware since 2019 that D\*\*\*coin had no value yet promoted D\*\*\*coin  to profit from its trading,"" the complaint said. ""Musk used his pedestal  as World's Richest man to operate and manipulate the D\*\*\*coin Pyramid  Scheme for profit, exposure and amusement.""

The complaint also aggregates comments from Warren Buffett, Bill Gates and others questioning the value of cryptocurrency.

Tesla, SpaceX and a lawyer for Musk did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

A  lawyer for Johnson did not immediately respond to requests for comment  on what specific evidence his client has or expects to have that proves  D\*\*\*coin is worthless and the defendants ran a pyramid scheme.

Johnson  is seeking $86 billion in damages, representing the decline in  D\*\*\*coin's market value since May 2021, and wants it tripled.

He  also wants to block Musk and his companies from promoting D\*\*\*coin and a  judge to declare that trading D\*\*\*coin is gambling under federal and  New York law.

The  complaint said D\*\*\*coin's selloff began around the time Musk hosted the  NBC show ""Saturday Night Live and, playing a fictitious financial  expert on a ""Weekend Update"" segment, called D\*\*\*coin ""a hustle.""

Tesla in February 2021 said it had bought $1.5 billion of b\*\*coin and for a short time accepted it as payment for vehicles.

D\*\*\*coin traded at about 5.8 cents on Thursday, down from its May 2021 peak of about 74 cents.

The case is Johnson v. Musk et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 22-05037.",-0.1,2022-06-17,0

$COIN is a Sleeping Titan with a Trajectory for the Moon,112,qn48yx,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qn48yx/coin_is_a_sleeping_titan_with_a_trajectory_for/,111,2021-11-05 11:04:20,"Alright, Coinbase announces Q3 earnings this Monday, and I couldn’t be more bullish.

To start out, the company has been absolutely printing money, with a current P/E ratio of 33.50.  If you take just their most recent Q2 earnings, their P/E ratio is 13.56.  Compare that to any other rapidly growing tech stock, I’m talking Square, Snapchat, AirBnB and other “popular among youths” stocks with P/E ratios of 100+.  Yes, this is largely in part to Coinbase absolutely crushing Q2 earnings, but at the rate things are going, I don’t think that earnings report was an anomaly.

According to multiple websites I found with a quick google search, Coinbase is now the most downloaded app on the App Store and second on the Play Store.  I’ve seen the new ad campaigns all over the place, which is always a good indicator of a company becoming more established.  With customer acquisitions skyrocketing and the cryp\*o market as a whole reaching all time highs, I see no reason Coinbase can’t demolish earnings the same way it did last quarter, perhaps even harder.  But this brings me to the one critique many have of $COIN: it follows the cryp\*o market too closely.  For example, if bi\*coin goes on a run, you can expect $COIN to follow it, and vice versa.  But this isn’t necessarily a bad thing, nor does it have to be permanent.

The cryp\*o market as a whole has been on a tremendous bull run since its inception (for the most part of course), and with serious attempts at integrating cryp\*o into day to day life, I don’t see this changing anytime soon.  Bi\*coin has dominated the cryp\*o space, and much like $COIN, other cryp\*os have a habit of following the price of bi\*coin.  However, other cryp\*os are starting to emerge with rocketing market caps, each one making bi\*coin a smaller piece of the overall pie.  With alternative coins like  diverging from bi\*coin, the cryp\*o space is likely to become more diverse as time continues, much like the stock market is today.  This will hopefully make for a healthier, less dominated market that will be less volatile as a whole.  So if bi\*coin has a rough day, other futuristic magic internet money can cushion the blow if they’ve diversified the market enough at that point.  Besides, bi\*coin, despite having harsh swings, does majorly trend upward, so even if bi\*coin stays at the top,  $COIN following the cryp\*o market might not be so bad.

So, to sum up what’s been stated, Coinbase has been growing rapidly, is extremely profitable, and has been majorly underestimated by investors across the board with a track record of demolishing expectations on earnings and customer acquisition expectations.  The only caveat for some being that it follows the price of a volatile market too closely, which is hardly a bad thing given that market’s history in the long term is very green, and hopefully won’t be the trend for the stock forever anyways.

But do you want to know why I REALLY believe in Coinbase? Well, put on your tinfoil hats, because things are about to get fringe.

To start, why has Tesla recently become a trillion plus dollar company?  Is it because of their profitability?  No, their P/E ratio is over 350.  Clearly it’s because of the prospect of what’s to come.  The eventual decline of oil as the most environmentally conscious generation grows up and the world’s energy becomes renewable.  Everyone drives a Tesla, and lives on a clean, smog free planet.  When you buy into Tesla, you’re not just buying into a car manufacturer, you’re investing in the prospect of what’s to come, and what Tesla represents as a whole: a bright optimistic future, and a revolutionary macroeconomic change.  So, if this is the case, what does that mean for Coinbase?

Well, I can see $COIN becoming a similar thing; a stock that not only is tied to a growing, healthy company, but as a way to buy into the overall long term trend of cryp\*o becoming mainstream.  Since Coinbase is the premier means of dipping your toes in the cryp\*o seas, buying the stock means you see the value in the cryp\*o market in the long term.  $COIN could grow to represent the anticipation of the cryp\*o market growing, just the same way I believe $TSLA represents the anticipation of an eco-friendly renewable future.  In the same way, it paints a bright optimistic future: the death of banks as cryp\*o rises and everyone races Teslas to compete in the annual Do\*ecoin Cup.  And investors eat up investments that emulate a bright future like candy.  Take weed stocks, the companies aren’t too great in their fundamentals, but, again, they represent a bright, utopian future for pot enthusiasts: weed being mainstream.

But Coinbase still diverts from these companies paving the way for a utopian future in one major way:  IT PRINTS MONEY.  So even if you don’t believe my philosophy that investors buy into companies because of what the perceived success of the company means as a whole (bright, utopian future on the horizon), the company is still phenomenal in its fundamentals.

I’ll be watching Monday’s earnings with my whole 6 shares (shallow pockets boohoo) and a bag of popcorn in hand, as I watch the next trillion dollar company climb to the moon.

Post earnings damage control edit:  Well guess I'll hold that.  The gay bears win this round, but I'm here for the long game.  With Q4 already setting records for cryp\*o, I have no problem holding the shares for another 3 months at least.

And most of you newbies have not ever traded in a bear market. You subconsciously believe 100% runups in 15 months is fairly normal.

Evergrande is not a fucking joke we should sit across the globe from and laugh about. Evergrande is the tip of the iceberg, and the housing market in China will collapse. In China, housing is 33% of GDP. In the U.S., it's 6.2%. You can't put 2 and 2 together? Tens, maybe hundreds of millions of workers in China will lose their jobs as the economy tries to adapt to the fact that housing is worth half of what they thought. Those with capital in the property market (90% of the pop) will realize their paper wealth is (again) worth half of what they thought, and stop spending as much on their iPhones and French designer apparel and Model S's, causing a global recession. Those who lent to certain Chinese corporations, probably aren't getting their money back, they are fucked too. Contagion is real.

Assuming they don't pay their offshore bond payment, Evergrande will be in default on October 23 (9 days). Probably mid-next week the media will finally start talking about it again. Fear will finally kick in in the markets and we will see more blood.

Why isn't the market pricing this in yet? Guess what, this same thing happened in the 2008 housing crash. Half of the smart money kept the price up while they slowly dumped their bags and even shorted the housing market. Just watch the Big Short again, there is a substantial period where swaps are not priced properly even as defaults skyrocket, as various investment banks try to get ahead of the crisis and ""head for the exit in a crowded theater.""

IMO, the people who are going to hurt the most are the thetards who have been selling naked puts and making bank for the past year and don't realize how exposed they really are. Are you fucking kidding me? Retail selling options in masse is a recipe for disaster. I hope they at least used spreads. Volatility is way undervalued given all the near-term concerns and it's entirely possible for some of the big ticker names out there to drop 50% over the next 3-12 months. Margin calls will fuel the downward spiral. This time, the public isn't going as supportive of JPOW's money printer because they'll be sick of inflation.

$COIN = MOON POTENTIAL,84,mr5spq,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mr5spq/coin_moon_potential/,129,2021-04-15 08:03:25,"Have been seeing a lot of negativity around Coinbase so wanted to provide an echo chamber for us bulls who FOMO'd in near the open.

First off, Coinbase should not be valued as an exchange, it makes no sense to compare it to Nasdaq or NYSE. COIN is rapidly growing, has a vastly different transaction structure, and is beginning to expand into the services market.

Now let's get into some numbers. 2020 Revenue was 1.28 B which is 140% growth over 2019, that is ridiculous. The really crazy number, 1.8 B in revenue for Q1 2021. They had 50% more revenue in Q1 2021 than the entirety of 2020. Let that sink in for a minute. Net Income for Q1 2021 was also around 750 M. If they were to sustain this net income for the rest of the year, that would put them at a 28 P/E ratio... for a company growing this quick? It's important to keep in mind that this was a record quarter for COIN and likely not sustainable near term but it still shows what they are capable of. 

Additionally, they announced that they are up to 56 million users with 6.1 of those being Monthly Transacting Users (MTUs) in Q1 2021. This is a massive jump over the previous quarter and COIN explains that the rise in MTUs is largely due to the increase in price and volatility around virtual currencies. For some reference, Robinhood has 13 million monthly users but get nowhere near the revenue per user that COIN does. These ""virtual currencies"" have continued increasing so far in Q2 2021 so I am expecting another knockout quarter in both revenue and MTUs. Expect the Q2 earnings report to blow past expectations (think massive tendie spike).

Speaking of those beefy transaction fees that COIN gets, there's no way that's sustainable right? It's going to be a race to the bottom, just like the stock trading fees? Well, not exactly. Investors love how simple Coinbase makes trading and are willing to pay a small premium for this ease of use. Currently, fees are massive percentagewise for small trades but become pretty reasonable at a large scale. I could see them lowering rates significantly for these small trades once they build up some more consistent institutional trading revenue and service revenue. 

There's probably some reason to worry about declining margins in the transaction side of the business, however, that's not why COIN deserves to hit $500+. Coinbase's services platform is massively undervalued and is something the mainstream media largely ignores. This segment of the business is growing very quickly and should not be overlooked. If you look at what Cathie Wood says about digital wallets, it should be clear how much potential Coinbase has to monetize it's users. It's creating an entire financial ecosystem built around Coinbase that's designed to keep users around.

"Should you listen to Jim Cramer? - I analyzed 20,000+ recommendations made by Jim Cramer during the last 5 years. Here are the results.",4186,rvuzw8,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rvuzw8/should_you_listen_to_jim_cramer_i_analyzed_20000/,364,2022-01-04 19:28:39,"Jim Cramer has made 21,609 stock picks in the past 5 years! Let that sink in for a moment. Here is one person, making buy/sell/hold recommendations on more than 2,200+ different stocks across all types of industries. On average, he was making more than 20 picks per episode of his show \[1\]. This is a staggering number of picks to be made by one person! \[2\]

While we can all argue about his expertise in making recommendations on such a wide array of industries and companies, what I wanted to know was:

1. **How accurate were his recommendations?**
2. **Would you have made or lost money if you followed them?**
3. **Can you beat the market following his picks?**

So it’s high time that we put Cramer to the ultimate test and end the debate about his usefulness once and for all!

https://preview.redd.it/ky8qh0nzeo981.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=104b963a012fc82a7a12585615dbd98c402e0a26

**Analysis**

The data about all the stock picks made by Cramer are available [here](https://madmoney.thestreet.com/screener/index.cfm) \[3\]. The picks are classified into five segments (Buy, Hold, Sell, Positive/Negative mention). I have calculated the return for each segment separately \[4\] so that we can know what to focus on if we are trying to replicate this strategy.

Since Cramer frequently contradicts his own picks and is mainly focused on short-term trades, I am only analyzing the stock returns for the following periods \[5\].

a. One-day

b. One-Week

c. One-Month

Given that Mad Money (Cramer’s Show) airs after the market closes, I have used the opening price of the next day for my calculations. (I.e If Cramer makes a recommendation on Thursday night, I use Friday opening price as the base for my calculations)

All the data used in the calculations are shared at the end.

https://preview.redd.it/yc7i0we0fo981.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb1c59f7bb5c02119e674ffaaf079fa67afa6120

**Results**

https://preview.redd.it/5ezb3bw1fo981.png?width=775&format=png&auto=webp&s=6fb146c04d7e9311751be085f6d21348fafac092

1-day performance of Cramer’s recommendations is excellent! On average, the Buy and Positive mention stocks went up by 0.03 and 0.05% respectively, and sell and negative mention stocks went down by 0.1 and 0.02%.

Another interesting fact is that ***you would not have lost money*** if you followed Cramer’s Buy recommendations. Across the time periods, his Buy recommendations have on average netted you positive returns \[6\]!

His sell recommendations did not pan out so well. Even though they dropped in price the next day, over the next week and month, they returned inline or even better than his buy recommendations!

Given that there is a counter-intuitive trend in the returns, let’s calculate the accuracy of his calls.

https://preview.redd.it/rht12ux2fo981.png?width=792&format=png&auto=webp&s=c571f5fc7d63fcb095555080320757192129d380

Here I am assigning a call as correct based on price change. If he gives a buy recommendation, I expect the price to go up and vice versa. As we can see from the chart above, his recommendations only do slightly better than a coin-toss. Even this only holds for short-term and buy recommendations with long-term sell recommendation performance dropping below 50% \[7\].

While this narrow edge over the 50% mark can be used by algo-traders who have the ability to trade a large amount of stocks, if you are an average investor listening in on a Cramer show and hear about a stock recommendation, you might as well toss a coin to see if you should invest or not!

Finally, it’s time we pit **Cramer against the market**. Do his recommendations beat the market?

https://preview.redd.it/5fszhew3fo981.png?width=1020&format=png&auto=webp&s=1cf5e2c992435a6d8ed36dbed707b11dd4cd30ba

Oh yeah! I was as surprised with the results as you are. I ran the numbers again and then one more time but got the exact same result! Cramer’s Buy recommendations beat the S&P 500 by a factor of 10 for the **one-day time frame**. But, if you held the stocks for anytime longer, you would have underperformed the market significantly.

Before you go daytrade on his recommendations you should know that the numbers we are seeing here are heavily influenced by outliers. If you miss out on the top 1% of recommendations (\~110 stocks out of the 11,000+ buy recommendations he had made), your **1-day return would be -0.062% instead of +0.034** \[8\].

https://preview.redd.it/1xtamkf0fo981.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6b9215c2379524644653c67ff375667c8f0354a

**Limitations of the analysis**

The analysis has some limitations that you should be aware of before trying to replicate the strategy.

1. As the astute among you might have noticed, if you sum up all the stocks used in the analysis it would only come to 18.5k. I removed \~15% of the overall recommendations as either they did not have stock data present in Yahoo Finance/Alpha Vantage or the price data did not match with the one given on the Mad Money website.
2. The data is obtained from the Mad Money website itself. I haven’t manually verified if the calls recorded on the website are in fact an accurate representation of the calls made by Cramer in his show. The below statement is given in their description and I am taking them on their word.

>We are impartial in our recording and simply log exactly what was said. We do not interpret the calls. If a call is vague or in question we simply won't list it.

https://preview.redd.it/11nzh3f0fo981.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=a15a32e373431bc460ce4c082a94ee58e7c392a6

**Conclusion**

No matter the public opinion on Cramer, we can generate excellent 1-day returns following his buy recommendations (even beating the market in doing so!). Whether it’s due to his superior stock picking ability or whether it’s simply due to self-fulfilling prophecy \[9\] (as he has a wide audience who will act on his advice) is yet to be known.

I would bet on the latter as, if the extraordinary one-day returns were in fact due to his superior stock-picking ability, the returns should have held over longer time periods, and also his sell recommendations would not have ended up performing better than his buy recommendations as we are observing here.

It only makes sense to listen to his advice if you are a day-trader or an algo-trader who is trading a large variety of stocks over short periods of time. For everyone else, just sticking to the S&P 500 would give you better returns over the long run!

**Footnotes and existing research**

**\[1\]** For those who don’t know, Cramer makes his picks in a CNBC show called [Mad Money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Money). Cramer himself defines the show as something which should be used for speculative/high-risk investing and not for your retirement portfolio.

**\[2\]** For comparison purposes, an equity research analyst [covers only 10-25 companies](https://whatforwork.com/jobs/equity-research-analyst-sell-side/).

**\[3\]** It’s not in an easily usable format. I had to parse the data from the webpage using Python (Beautiful Soup) - I have shared all the data used in this analysis as an Excel and Rows file at the end.

**\[4\]** I did not calculate for Hold as he only made 27 hold recommendations, which is lower than what is required for a statistical significance.

**\[5\]** In my [last post about Jim Cramer](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mtehdq/i_analyzed_all_700_buy_and_sell_recommendations/), there was a lot of controversy around how I calculated the time period. So here is the detailed version about how the time period is considered. For One-Day returns, we are considering that we will purchase the stock the next trading day after the market opens and then sells it at the end of the trading day. For weekly and monthly returns, I am using adjusted closing price since across a week or month there can be stock splits as well as dividends.

**\[6\]** This can also be attributed to the market rally we have experienced over the last 5 years where a large majority of stocks went up.

**\[7\]** 50% benchmark might be controversial with a lot of you (I agree given that if we are in a bull market there is more than a 50-50 chance of a stock going up tomorrow) → My rationale here is standing today looking at a stock, there are only two things that can happen tomorrow. It can either go up or go down. I assign equal probability to both given anything can happen tomorrow. The market can turn bearish, positive or negative news about the company can come up, etc. If you have a better logic for a benchmark, please do suggest!

**\[8\]** But to be fair to Cramer, this is applicable to all types of Investment strategies and hedge funds! The performance of a few of the stocks in your portfolio will finally end up heavily influencing the returns of your overall portfolio. → Think of Tesla incase of ARK and FAANG in case of S&P 500.

**\[9\]** There is some [existing research](https://scholarship.tricolib.brynmawr.edu/handle/10066/588) that deep dives into this topic.

**\[10\]** Since it’s a live tracker using data from Alpha Vantage, the calculation is done slightly differently than in the analysis (in the live tracker I had to use the closing price on the day of recommendation instead of the opening price of the next day). I will be updating it to follow the same process as the analysis as soon as I get info from Alpha Vantage.",0.0,2022-01-04,0

The SEC will almost certainly not allow an entity which is currently involved in litigation and charged with securites violations to act as the custodian for the new Bitcoin spot ETFs. It is far more likely that in their recent meetings they have advised Blackrock to modify their application to designate Prometheum as their custodian. It also does not make sense to allow $COIN to be the custodian and then pass a new rule 4 months later saying only registered entities can be custodians.

All aboard Coinbase $COIN for a blowout 8/12 ER 🚂🚀🚂🚀🚂,87,oi8y6l,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oi8y6l/all_aboard_coinbase_coin_for_a_blowout_812_er/,104,2021-07-11 23:12:01,"Coinbase ($COIN) will be a cash cow for years to come.

In Q1 alone they had $1.8B of revenue and $771M of profit (\~43% margins). Q2 earnings are coming up the 8/20 expiry is looking juicy. My guess is that with an extremely volatile quarter for internet money, they will blow Q1 out of the water and we'll be above $300 by the end of July.

**This is what I like about the stock:**

1. Their trading commissions blow traditional brokerage houses out of the water
2. Bid/ask spreads are wider than Strahan's gap tooth
3. Fees are fat (and scale with transaction size)
4. They just [unveiled](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-25/coinbase-expands-prime-brokerage-services-to-institutional-users) an institutional ""Prime"" service on 5/25 catering to corporations looking to diversify their balance sheets
5. In addition to the ""exchange"" business, they're now lending, offering debit/credit card products, and soon will allow you to generate passive income by ""staking"" your assets (FYI this bullet alone encompasses the entire banking industry, Visa, Mastercard, JPM, BAML, etc.)
6. Despite the big internet money dump, the key driver to trading activity is VOLATILITY - which causes lots of buying/selling, and we definitely had that in Q2

Their total addressable market is also massive and faux asset / internet money adoption is beating the trend of the *internet* when it came out.

**This is what I hate about this stock:**

1. There's an existential threat of fake assets flaming out like in 2017, even though this seems less likely with each passing day as more and more institutions hold internet money on their balance sheets and incorporate it into their remittance / payments infrastructure
2. It's weird that Sat-oshi is unknown and still holds $35B of the core asset, making him the greatest hero but also the greatest threat if he/she/they/zir were to dump

So it's not necessarily a slam dunk but I'm betting fake assets continue to evolve from meme dog coins to real utility providers in the DeFi ecosystem. Also, this an ancillary business to the trading / brokerage side of the house: which is displacing business from Fidelity, Charles Schwab, CBOE, stock exchanges, etc. as people go digital.

In my opinion, DeFi is going to completely disrupt the banking system, and CB can take a leading role in monetizing that ecosystem. It simply doesn't make sense to store cash deposits yielding 0.01% at Chase when you can be earning 7-10% on cash in stable coins.

Buffett all the way back at $86.6b (time to BTFD on Buffett??)

Jack Ma at $50.1b, although much of that will probably be spent on his funeral when 🍯 🐻 finally announces his death.

Time for WSB to pump that price up - just need one  “stock price is too high” tweet from Elon, a capital raise to dilute the shares and perhaps another split so we can hit $420 once again and he will be the richest man on this planet.

Perhaps after he becomes the richest person alive, he can finally concentrate on helping Tesla become more profitable than a kids lemonade stand.

COIN is still at risk of a huge drop given its revenue makeup,69,104qfqq,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/104qfqq/coin_is_still_at_risk_of_a_huge_drop_given_its/,60,2023-01-06 15:31:58,"It's shocking how few people (analysts) have mentioned Coinbase's revenue segmentation and fee structure. Here's a look at Coinbase's revenue from their previous quarter:  

Retail: $26B volume and 346M in revenue (roughly 1.5% fee)  
Institutional: $133B volume and (pathetic) 20M revenue (.015% fee)  

The majority of their volume is near worthless.

1.5% fees are insane and Coinbase Pro (now Advanced Trading) had .6% taker fees as the highest possible fee. This illustrates just how much of their revenue is a result of uninformed user paying super high fees. The fees are unsustainable. Simply moving to ""Pro"" which is really just a link you click and KYC would lower revenue by at least 50%.  

Traditional brokers have had more or less no problem moving to free trading, and the spreads are definitely not 1.5%+ just to make up for that ""freebie"". There is no reason to think crypto will be any different in the end. Fees will continue to collapse and likely also go to ""free"".  

This also comes at a time when volume has completely collapsed. Coinbase volume is public. It's more or less already known how badly it has fallen. Couple falling volume with falling trading fee rates and you have the perfect storm for earnings.  

As it stands now, I believe the vast majority of Coinbase's valuation should just be in their ownership of Circle (and potential earnings on reserves) and their user base/brand as an acquisition target. If you believe crypto will actually go mainstream, then you should believe that there will be tons of ETFs that can just be traded for free by people with Ameritrade, e-trade, ML, whatever. There will be no reason for anyone to deal with CB if they can just get exposure via free trading of ETFs through their traditional broker.  

In short, Coinbase is fucked. Not only are you subject to the shit trading model, but you are also subject to the crypto asset price declines.  

Coinbase goes down just as much as crypto, but never goes up as much as crypto. There is really no reason to own Coinbase if you can just buy Bitcoin. Coinbase has the same or worse downside, with absolutely worse upside.  

Coinbase is barely more than an acquisition target for its user base. Can get plenty of return on reserve from other financial institutions if you just want exposure to short term interest rates.",0.4000000000000001,2023-01-06,1

Top 5 Tips Every Noobie Trader MUST Know.,4804,k4ztif,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k4ztif/top_5_tips_every_noobie_trader_must_know/,395,2020-12-02 07:38:15,"Been awhile since I made a post educating you retards, throwing pearls before swine. I've been disheartened by some of the comments I've read recently and just wanted to provide some tips for the genuine noobies/retards among us. If you already know this shit, congrats, move along sir.

Take a look at my previous, more advanced guide to some theta gang theory for those looking for something a bit more in depth: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/iz68r4/how\_to\_consistently\_outperform\_the\_sp500\_using/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/iz68r4/how_to_consistently_outperform_the_sp500_using/)

Without further ado... TOP 5 TIPS Every Noobie Trader MUST Know.

# 1) You MUST understand Implied Volatility.

I made this the first point because it is the gigantic mistake I see noobies here making again and again. I'm talking to you, people who bought calls on PLTR at $30.  **If you learn anything from this post, you MUST learn this.**

You see a stock make a massive move either up or down. Your immediate response is ""this is a great opportunity to buy calls/puts on a volatile stock!"" Right? WRONG!

In fact, when a stock has just made a massive move in either direction, that is perhaps the WORST time to purchase options in EITHER direction. Options are not stupid. Options are designed to price in the fact that a stock is moving wildly. This is called ""implied volatility."" They become more expensive as a stock makes more dramatic moves, to price in the volatility you and everyone else is expecting.

It's quite possible and even likely that you buy an option on a high IV stock, and the stock moves in your direction, and yet you LOSE money, because it didn't move as dramatically as was expected by the implied volatility. **This is called ""IV crush.""** It only takes one or two experiences with IV crush for most traders to learn this lesson for life. If you understand this concept before you lose a ton of money, all the better.

**So, what should you do if a stock is highly volatile and options are expensive due to IV?**

There are two choices: Trade actual shares, or SELL the options rather than buy them.

If you are bullish on a high IV stock, you can take a bullish position by SELLING a cash-secured put rather than buying the call. If you are bearish on a high IV stock, you can take a bearish position by SELLING a call rather than buying a put (although this entails greater risk and will typically require higher options trading level by your broker).

# 2) You MUST have patience.

It's a tale as old as time. A noobie investor does some research, reads some DD, and is convinced a stock is going to rise over the next couple years. So he buys in. A bad day or two hits and the stock tanks. He panics, and sells. The next couple days the stock rises and appears to stabilize. So he buys back in again, because he still believes in his thesis. The stock drops again, and he panic sells again.

In reality the stock is just trading sideways, but this idiot keeps buying on green days and selling on red days. This is perhaps the most idiotic, suicidal strategy anyone could ever employ. Buying on green and selling on red is a surefire strategy to lose money consistently over time.

This is why you MUST remove your emotions from your trades, because your emotions will usually tell you to buy on green and sell on red, literally buy high and sell low. As the boomer Warren Buffett once stated: **""The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient.""**

Here is a better approach. Set up your entire trade BEFORE you make the trade. Have a set price you will sell at if things go south. Have a target price you will sell at if things go well. Once the dust settles you can learn from any mistakes. Were you too aggressive, or too conservative in your targets? What emotions directed you to make those mistakes? Too much greed, too much risk aversion, too LITTLE risk aversion? Make every trade a learning opportunity.

# 3) You MUST understand ""Reversion to the Mean.""

In general, stocks will tend to revert to their trendlines.

This thesis is fairly simple. If a stock moons 10% in a day, the most likely event is a drop the next day. If a stock tanks 10% in a day, the most likely event is a rise the next day. This is because humans are emotional creatures. First, they overreact to big news. Next, one of two things happen: When the stock is way up, people see it as a profit taking opportunity, so they sell. When the stock is way down, people see it as a buying opportunity, so they buy.

I don't have any hard data to back up this thesis, but I'm sure there's a bunch of nerds out there with hard data that proves exactly this, as well as trading algorithms specifically designed for a ""reversion to the mean"" strategy that are consistently profitable.

Obviously there will be exceptions, as well as times when a big move signals a shift in the trendline. All I am saying is in the MAJORITY of cases, reversion to the mean will occur. Don't go chasing stocks that have made massive short-term swings in a single direction unless you have strong reasons (not just hopes) to believe the trend has changed.

# 4) You MUST not YOLO your account more than once (or twice).

This is going to be controversial for some of you. But it's just straight math. If you keep betting your entire account, or close to it, on single trades, **it's only a matter of time before you go broke. That is a mathematical guarantee.**

Let's say you are one of the most skilled, intelligent, informed investors on the planet (doubtful). So skilled your plays are 90% correct. If you bet your entire portfolio on each trade, you are still expected to go completely broke after around 10 trades.

Let's say you aren't a brilliant stonk gambler. Let's say you are just average and your trades are a coin flip (which is generous for a lot of you retards). **If you bet your entire bankroll on each bet, on average you will go completely broke in just 2 trades.**

Again, there is a lot of complicated math we can go through to predict account explosion times and optimal bet sizing and so on, but that isn't necessary here. Professional gamblers such as poker players have refined bankroll management theory, which usually means at the least they aren't putting more than 10% of their cash on the table in one sitting, usually closer to 5%. (Take a look at the ""Kelley criterion"" for an interesting read: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly\_criterion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion))

I know a lot of you are broke with no life prospects and hoping to get rich quick. I don't fault you for that, I get it. The problem arises when you see the people who got insanely lucky with guessing 10 coin flips in a row who turned $1000 into $1,000,000, and hope to do the same... **but for every one retard with a record like that you've got hundreds more who lose it all and have nothing to show for it.**

I won't fault anyone for making a gigantic, life-changing bet a single time. That is your choice to make, and it just might pay off. But if you think you are going to do that again and again and survive, you are delusional.

# 5) You MUST be Skeptical... of EVERYTHING.

Fools and their money are soon parted. Don't be a fool.

Your first instincts when hearing ANYTHING should be skepticism. Your friend has a hot stock tip? Start with skepticism. Some online DD on a meme or penny stock online sounds convincing? Start with skepticism. A highly respected financial or government agency gives future guidance on whatever... again, start with skepticism.

There are a million people out there trying to take advantage of you, to pump and dump you, to scam you, to trick you into spending more money on whatever.

There are times when being a conformist pays off, like when markets rally for months straight. There are times when being a contrarian pays off, like when markets tank and sectors collapse. Don't be a consistent conformist nor a consistent contrarian. Be skeptical of every thesis and every hypothesis you hear, or even the ones you invent yourself.

When you take this approach honestly and still become convinced of a thesis, you have a higher probability than most of being correct.

**Seek out opinions that contradict your biases, not opinions that confirm your biases.** This is incredibly difficult and goes against human nature, but if you can achieve this ideal, you will out-trade 90% of the public.

$COIN is currently at a market cap of $90B, so if that $1.6B profit holds steady for the rest of 2021, that would put their P/E ratio at 14 (90/(1.6\*4)). That is insanely low for the premier crypt-o trading platform in the US.

And you know what? I think $COIN is actually going to **beat** their previous revenue numbers in Q3. Looking in their Q2 letter to shareholders ( [Coinbase-Q221-Shareholder-Letter.pdf (q4cdn.com)](https://s27.q4cdn.com/397450999/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/Coinbase-Q221-Shareholder-Letter.pdf), p. 11), we can see that the vast majority of their revenues come from transactions (fees, etc.):

[Revenue Breakdown](https://preview.redd.it/1ghla29ecix71.png?width=716&format=png&auto=webp&s=d974927ebbf2f51eb346cee011b6410a1bb5b8bd)

And you know what happened since then? First, we had doggie-coin mania (see Coinbase's blog about adding the most recent one to go parabolic:  [Shiba Inu (SHIB) is now available on Coinbase | by Coinbase | Sep, 2021 | The Coinbase Blog](https://blog.coinbase.com/shiba-inu-shib-is-now-available-on-coinbase-e7fdd13856be) ). This suggests to me that overall interest in crypt-o was high during Q3. And guess what else? Coinbase just recently jumped to the top of the app download charts on iOS (#1) and Android (#2):  [Coinbase Is The Most Downloaded iOS App In The US, Second On Play Store - Converted Organics (COIN) | Benzinga](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/21/10/23710233/coinbase-is-the-most-downloaded-ios-app-in-the-us-second-on-play-store).

Based on this, I'm betting that transaction volume was **even higher in Q3 than Q2**. If I'm right, $COIN could print at the upcoming earnings announcement. And even if it doesn't print, I'd be pretty happy to hold this bag for the long term.

This will be $350+ before you blink.  On their exchange it was trading a tokenized version for $600 which was approx $150B marketcap.  Realistically anything $350 or beyond is speculation as it’ll be priced beyond perfection.  So how to make money...?

A rising tide lifts all boats.  Two companies in same space are flying under the radar, Bakkt ($v i h) and eToro ($f t c v).  Marketcap are right now $3B and $14b.  

Bakkt is fully regulated, majority owned by ICE/NYSE (owns 76%), Steven Cohen owns 5.6%, and has 3.3 million shares short which could trigger a squeeze today through end of week if this gets volume today.  Fully regulated, started by selling futures on b1tcoin, and just launched their retail digital wallet. Who says digital wallets are the future?

EToro is a platform to buy/sell crypt0 and stocks.  It’s focus is in Europe and just expanding into US now.  Their revenue is about 1/3 the size of $Coin but it’s marketcap could be as small as 1/10 of $coin (depends where $coin goes today).  Robinhood wants to ipo at $50B and eToro is same size.  Again a high volume day here as a sympathy play could result in big gains rest of week.  If people don’t want to put $350 into $coin they are going to look for next best thing.  I think a lot of them will land here.  

Imo both of these will run today and rest of week.  I would not be surprised at all to see either one double by week’s end.  Glta.",0.1,2021-04-14,1

Red is a bear flag which broke down --> retested. You can see the results - perfect follow through. Nailed this 402 support and decided to form **another** bear flag on top of it. This one is smaller, but better because it has three clear reactions to the lower line. It also has confluence. For you retards, that means things lining up that generate a higher probability of success for the play. In this case, that **402** level lines up right with our entry.

To play this one, you wanna wait for a **weekly** close below 402. From there, I am targeting **273.75 and 160.50.** Seems like a stretch, but if these companies leveraged to the tits in bullshit jpegs really go ass up, it's possible.

Basically the same fucking thing just wedges instead, I don't need to explain that shit. Reason I don't like it as much is because there is less confluence. There is also support just under the breakdown @ 11.98.

For this guy, the breakdown is on a weekly close below **16.00** from there I am targeting 11.98, 7.59. to be conservative. Sure it can go lower, but pigs get slaughtered. So do retards, so do what you want. I'm not your financial advisor. For this one I'm looking at June 10 puts.

Next up is: $COIN

This is my least favorite for a few reasons:

1. It slopes downwards, this means you get a worse margin of error on the play.
2. No confluence.
3. It's not nearly as shitty of a company as the others.

Still, it's playable. For this one, you want a weekly close below 141.70 for entry. Keep in mind this will slope down every single week. From there, I would target 100.00 or so. I'd use June 120 puts to do so.

Last but not the least shitty, we have: $MARA

Actually I like this setup the second most. Confluence with the breakdown and 19.25. Subsequently, you want a weekly close under 19.25 to enter this one. From there I would target 14.70 and 6.94. I'd use June 15 puts to do so.

Recently, I've been arguing with internet finance professionals over the overused and misunderstood argument of ""POPCORN is a cheaper stock to own than GME"" or ""Why would I buy 1 GME share when I can have 10 POPCORN shares?"" or my personal favorite ""if both stocks go to $10,000 at one point in the squeeze, than which one makes more sense to buy now you fucking idiot?!?!"".

All of which are valid arguments if you have no understanding of equity or market capitalization. But since our world has logic and concepts, they are unfortunately wrong... or fortunately wrong depending on how you want to look at it.

Here are some examples of exchanges I have had recently that pissed me off enough to spend almost two hours sifting through data and subsequently writing up a ""DD"" about it. And really, I'm only writing this because I'm tired of having to explain it, so from now on, I can just link this to them instead.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/901kgxd2zcr81.png?width=668&format=png&auto=webp&s=271070d092e60358faab8a9e33e55bd753200886

There are others, but you get my point.

&#x200B;

# Price, Market Capitalization & Equity.

Here is the most basic example of what I'm trying to prove:

If company A has 100 shares for $1 and company B has 50 shares for $2, both of their market caps equal $100. If you buy $10 worth of stock in both, you get 10 shares of company A and 5 shares of company B. Sure you have more shares of company A, but your equity ownership in both companies is the same. You own 10% of the company. That’s equity. Price is arbitrary.

If this is some psyop narrative being pushed by hedgies - congratz. It is working and you got bonus points for wasting my time. But, in the more probable situation... these people are just oblivious and fell for the psychological barrier to entry coupled with the return solely based on future price.

This ""trick"" is used by many. Recently and more notably, the Qrypto Alt Coin market took this concept by the balls and applied it harder than the investors that bought into these coins applied to Wendy's a few months after making their initial purchase.

The psychological barrier to entry is the perceived value an investor is getting for his or her money based on the actual dollar price per unit of the investment that they are buying and nothing else. They see this asset as a ""deal"" because of its low price point and their compulsion to buy is compounded by their unreasonable perception of the ceiling for potential future prices might be. Those Alt Coins with a $0.0000001 price per coin are using this concept to a ridiculous degree, which is why a lot of them got any traction in the first place. Moving on.

&#x200B;

# The Proof

I took the closing price of both stocks over the past two years (starting from 3/13/2020) and multiplied the outstanding shares (adjusting for any changes in OS) to get to the market capitalization for both stocks each and every day. Finally, I made a line graph chart to visualize the data because I know I'm writing to an audience that mostly indulges in picture books and I need to keep your attention.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8yg0ibigzcr81.png?width=1623&format=png&auto=webp&s=2332c19385c9ffba89b1a82da1ce765c18c08a54

The X-axis provides dates starting from 3/13/2020 to 4/1/2022 and the Y-axis provides you with the market capitalization. The red line represents POPCORN and the black line represents GME. I've chosen the colors for the two stocks with coincidence and appropriately… ;). Yes, before the sneeze in January 2021, GME was the more expensive stock. But after the sneeze and the run-ups in June, this is no longer the case. In fact, for the better of half a year, POPCORN was overwhelmingly more expensive to buy than GME. It was only until 1/27/2022 that their market caps were essentially equal to one another and their equity values per dollar were approximately 1 to 1. From 6/2/2021 (the date that POPCORN reached its peak) to 1/27/2022, popcorn was on average 26% more expensive on any given day than GME and maxed out at 43% more expensive on 9/10/2021 when the market capitalization of GME was $14.5B and POPCORN was $25.7B.

&#x200B;

# Let's do a hypothetical.

If you would have bought $1,000 worth of both stocks every day since 4/1/2021, you would have made $254,000 worth of buys in each stock.

(254 trading days since 4/1/2022 multiplied by $1,000)

I'm using 4/1/2021 as the date since it is the aftermath of the GME sneeze and before the POPCORN run-up to its peak on 6/2/2021. Plus it is exactly one year, so... I think it is a fair place to start.

As of last Friday's close, 4/1/2022 you would have 1,598 shares of GME and 11,156 shares of popcorn valued at $263,595 and $259,924, respectively. It gets worse for popcorn.

Now, let's do another hypothetical and say you missed the run-up in January for GME and the run-up in popcorn in June. You saw the crazy amounts of money people were making and wanted a piece of the action, so you FOMO in both stocks, not knowing any better. You do the same exercise as I mentioned previously by buying $1,000 worth of both each day starting on 8/2/2021. This time, there were 170 trading days. So you purchased $170,000 in both stocks.

As of last Friday's close, 4/1/2022 you would have 1,144 shares of GME and 6,458 shares of popcorn valued at $188,767 and $150,480, respectively.

In this scenario, not only are your GME shares worth more, you are actually losing almost $20,000 on POPCORN. This only gets worse as you move closer to 1/27/2022 when the stock's market capitalizations finally converge.

In the past 30 trading days, on average GME has only been 3% more expensive than POPCORN. So now would be a better time than ever to convert equity to GME.

But price points shouldn't be the only thing you consider. If you are a POPCORN holder and you don't realize that GME has set itself up with multiple catalysts in the coming months, you need to open your eyes. This may be the last time to get into GME before it explodes my tits. But this really wasn't the purpose of my post. I simply wanted to prove that POPCORN is not cheaper than GME with irrefutable evidence. But it's your money. Do what you want. NFA.

I want to share what I think is lining up to be the next CLOV... 

Still largely under the radar is Vancouver based WELL Health Technologies (TSX:WELL) which also has significant short interest, strong fundamentals , and billionaire backers. They just completed a $206M acquisition of “MyHealth” now making it the largest private clinic operator in Canada.

Just prior to that, the company recently announced the $372.9M Acquisition of CRH medical which significantly increased WELLs footprint in the US... This is where it gets interesting. Not only did JP Morgan extend there existing credit line to CRH medical by USD$100M to $300M and RBC provide a C$200M secured credit facility for the recent “MyHealth” acquisition. 

But the company legit partnered with Fenwick & West to assist with a NASDAQ IPO in Q4 of this year.... Fenwick client base is Facebook, Amazon, Cisco, and recently COIN... We are on a launch pad waiting to take off. 

Jumping into the charts now... WELL has consolidated for a year while they have exponentially grown the fundamentals of the business. Just recently they blew through every moving average.

Because of the differential between the physical spot price of silver, and the futures price in the COMEX there's an arbitrage: Anybody with any serious cash today could take silver delivery from the COMEX at $27, and quickly flip it for well over $30.

If silver futures start creeping up, this thing could completely snowball.

The current nonfarm unemployment rate stands today at 3.6% in the US as of April 2022

[Source](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf)

The current CPI Inflation rate today stands at 8.3% counting food and energy

[Source](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/11/business/economy/april-2022-cpi.html)

You can control inflation by raising interest rates. Raising interest rates makes it so people loan less money, loaning money is how money is made for the most part. It happens because of the money multiplier effect. Which works kinda like this. 

Imagine I’m a bank, and you deposit 100 dollars with me. Well as a bank I am legally required to keep 10% of deposits in storage (This is called [Required Reserve Rates)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/requiredreserves.asp), just in case you want to come and take money out. So from your $100 deposit, I loan out $90 to Person 1. Person 1 now takes that loan and spends it wherever he wants. But I have to keep $9 of those $90 in storage by law. So I can loan out $81 to Person 2 and so on.

 

[Money Multiplier Effect](https://preview.redd.it/1899omdljx591.png?width=753&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe2a034e1129b036f70ec773a28ae58a113c16f8)

 

If we make accounts and sum out all the money that I “have” as a bank, it's 100+90+81+72.9+65.61 and so on. In total for just these accounts you see on the graph. I as a bank can lay claim to **$717.57 total.** 

That's called the **Money Multiplier Effect**, there's more to it but that's the gist. 

Now how do you stop all this money creation? You make it very costly to loan money. Usually, the Fed raises interest rates. But they cannot simply raise interest rates across the board. What they do is raise the [Federal Funds Rate](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr)**.** Which is the interest rate at which banks can lend each other money, which eventually trickles down to the interest rate by which we get loaned money. 

 

[Federal Funds Rate vs Inflation](https://preview.redd.it/5ro6njlqlx591.png?width=1243&format=png&auto=webp&s=8dc7a1a2fb86ceb3b0172bd1054567f806822207)

 

When The Fed wants to rein in inflation, they raise interest rates very high above inflation. Now you have also noticed the big spike there in the middle left of the graph. This was a period of incredibly high inflation in the US during the 70s and 80s. It was solved by a man called Paul Volcker, who’s revered today among economists. The federal reserve at the time was unwilling to raise interest rates because it would cause a recession and kill jobs. But the persistant inflation problem was too much, so the Chairman of the Fed was fired and replaced with Paul Volcker. Paul went on to raise interest rates to such incredibly high levels that it caused a recession, and raised the unemployment rate to double digit numbers. People sent him threats and 2x4s where construction workers wrote “you are killing our jobs” but the man persisted. Once inflation came down, it remained down. In the US ever since we have enjoyed almost miraculous levels of stable 2% inflation since. In the EU they had 2-6% bouncing around, Turkey between 6-30%, and Mexico 2-30%.

However the work of Paul Volcker only reaches so far, today inflation rate is soaring high again, why do we not just raise rates again quickly? Because high inflation in the short term produces lots of jobs.

Now despite the fact that this graph says “wage inflation” because it is trying to explain a single phenomenon. It actually applies to ALL inflation, high inflation creates low unemployment. Here is why:

Imagine you want a widget that costs $90, it costs $90 next week and the week after, no problem at all.

But now imagine this widget instead cost $90 now, and $95 next week, and the week after $100. If you want this thing you better buy it **Now**. An increase in the speed at which people spend, because they have to buy everything right now, means businesses have more business because everyone is spending so much, so they hire more people.

Ok so whats the problem? Why does this have to end?

The first graph is “Consumer Credit Outstanding” meaning the amount of debt consumers have, for example, credit card debt. The second graph is “Personal Savings” which is just what is sounds like, the amount of savings people have in their account.

Michael Burry said of this of twitter  ""US Personal Savings fell to 2013 levels, the savings rate to 2008 levels — while revolving credit card debt grew at a record-setting pace back to the pre-COVID peak despite all those $trillions of cash dropped in their laps"" (Source is the article above the graphs)

Why are people doing this? Is this a failure of personal responsibility? Maybe but not likely, here is the mechanism of why inflation actually predicts this.

Lets go back to that $90 widget. Imagine that not only is the widget going from $90, to $95, to $100. But your total personal savings are $100. If you need this widget then you will buy it immediately and kill your savings. Usually, this is the stopping point for runaway inflation, even if companies keep raising prices, consumers simply wont buy them because they ran out their savings, so companies go easy on the pricing, and consumers slowly build back up their savings. 

You have probably done this as well. I imagine at least one of you, when gas prices were first rising from $2 to $4 decided to fill up your gas tank at 3$, just in case next week prices were even higher, and you were right. 

Well why has this not stopped? Why are prices rising and why are people taking out loans? Here is why:

Imagine you take out a loan for $100 with a 5% interest next week, and inflation is say 2%. 

Next week you will owe adjusted for inflation $100 + $5 in interest - $2 in inflation = $103 total.

Now imagine that inflation is at 4%. $100 + $5 interest - $4 inflation = $101 total.

Taking out loans has gotten **a lot** cheaper in adjusted terms. 

What if interest is also very low? Well today interest stands at around 0.75% going up to 1% 

[https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr)

So now imagine low interest rate **and** high inflation

$100 + $1 interest - $7 inflation = $94 total 

You now owe **less** in real terms by taking out a loan, which you then use the **Money Multiplier Effect** and you can see why all these things combined have been so bad.

**TLDR / In conclusion:**

The Federal Reserve will be forced to raise interest rates by a lot, which will increase unemployment, crash consumer spending, and make a temporary but hopefully controlled intentional recession.",0.0,2022-06-16,0

Rate cuts doesn’t mean the printer is coming back for fun. It means the printer is coming back due to need.

The broad economy is in a very high risk position right now and the global economy is deteriorating by the day. The market and economy are not reflecting the reality of the other.

-M2 money supply is decreasing at it’s fastest pace since the Depression

-China is in deflation

-Canada is on the verge of recession

-Germany is on the verge of recession

-CEO’s are beginning to discuss deflation potential

-The consumer is being hammered with student loans and high interest borrowing

-Freight is in recession

-California is in recession

-Available jobs are decreasing much quicker than expected

Rate cuts are great if people have jobs and money. Rate cuts are a lot less fun when millions of people are losing their jobs, the consumer halts spending, corporate earnings tank, housing supply rises due to the need to sell due to job losses and outpaces buyer demand and starts decreasing everyone’s sweet Covid equity gains.

Pay your debts, shore up the emergency funds, and hope you didn’t overpay for your house and car in the past few years!

Why you should pull your finger out of your ass about $COIN,64,sk3bb0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/sk3bb0/why_you_should_pull_your_finger_out_of_your_ass/,70,2022-02-04 09:15:30,"In this post I'll try to explain to you degens why Coinbase is actually a high growth tech company, and not some exchange that will become irrelevant in 3-5 years.

Let's ignore revenue from trading fees (89%) of Coinbase' revenue in Q3.

AND let's ignore the upcoming ""expensive jpeg"" (I know that's not the only use case, fuck off) marketplace.

Let's just focus on subscription & services revenue, which made up the other 11% of revenue from Q3.

Here's what you need to know. the average quarter over quarter growth rate for their subscription and services revenue over the last 4 quarters is 97.34%.

Yes (in millions $, Q3'2020 - Q3'2021): 10.7 > 20.7 > 56.4 > 102.6 > 145.2.

Now, you might say, millions is nothing for a company with a $40B market cap. Why are we talking about this?

Here's why: Q3 posed 41.5% growth in S&S revenue quarter over quarter, and this was during a ""winter"" where trading volumes were down 30% quarter over quarter. I propose that this means regardless of asset prices, institutions (primarily) are continuing to invest into this new asset class.

And that this category of revenue is going to CONTINUE to grow exponentially for the foreseeable future. Coinbase is the best positioned to serve the needs of existing institutional entities as well as startups that want to get involved in this space. And I see no competition coming.

Also, even if there was competition, guess what - Coinbase would probably be an investor, and probably acquire them. Their Venture arm has invested more than $26B in various ""decentralized web technology companies in 2021)

Analysts are expecting Coinbase revenue & earnings to decline substantially in 2022. I think for one thing, that Q4'2021 may surprise to the upside on higher than expected growth in the S&S category of revenue (since trading volumes are public data, there's not much room for surprise).

Furthermore, I think that 2022 is going to be another explosive year of adoption in all aspects of this space.

We'll talk about valuations next. Now, we can't ignore revenue from trading fee's here. So keep that in mind. But I like to think of revenue from trading fees much like the tax credits Tesla received that made them profitable originally. They may be temporary, but they are giving the company a really strong financial foundation to stand on. But let's try to price this company based on the underlying growth, with the understanding that the balance sheet is exceptionally  healthy.

Given their Q3 S&S revenue of $145M, up by \~1300% from Q3 of 2020... We'll to be honest, I started writing this section with the intent of proving they deserved a certain multiple, but I'm kinda retarded, so I'll leave that to somebody else. But I ASSERT that a P/E of \~16 (as it stands today) is too damn low. And - oh - by the way - after they report Q4 earnings it should be closer to 13.

Yes - If they have a record breaking quarter (they will), but, let's for simplicity assume they match Q2 (less the tax credit they cashed in Q2 which pumped their earnings \~$737M, and I might be missing something here but I'm doing the conservative thing) that would leave them with Q4 net income of $869M. Which would put their yearly EPS at $13.9. Which only edges out consensus to the upside by \~5%.

So if consensus is so on-the-nose, again, what are we talking about?

Well consensus is only coincidentally on the nose, because S&S revenue is only ramping up. An extra $100M here or there doesn't mean a lot to Coinbase' earnings today. But by the end of 2022, they could be doing closer to $1B (roughly 4x on the +$200M I expect to see in Q4 earnings) in S&S revenue each quarter. Do I know where the growth stops? no I do not. Which is why I'm bullish as fuck.

And again, analyst consensus is that Coinbase revenue declines in 2022 and beyond. I think there will be a tidal wave of price target raises somewhere between Q2 & Q3 of this year.

All of this to say that in the face of overwhelming evidence, analysts will have to raise price targets and somewhere along the way, wall street will realize Coinbase is a high growth tech company that deserves a growth multiple. Revenue diversification isn't coming, it's here, and it's sneaking up on everybody who doesn't understand why Coinbase should be worth more than Nasdaq.

"Why ""ETFs will destroy COIN"" is nonsense",8,1asdakn,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1asdakn/why_etfs_will_destroy_coin_is_nonsense/,15,2024-02-16 22:18:52,"The theory here is that because BTC ETFs offer exposure to bitcoin that people will no longer use COIN to buy their bitcoins (or whatever fake-ass-money flavor-of-the-week is hip) so COIN's trading revenues go down.  Here's why that's not likely to be true.

ETFs offer BTC exposure to people and COIN offers a trading platform.  Most of COIN's trading revenue likely comes from people who make orders of magnitudes more trades than the rest.  Usually relationships like these are defined by a ""power law"", with something 10% of people paying 90% of the trading fees and the lower 20% (or whatever) paying miniscule amounts because they only buy and hold.  

So... what business is the ETF taking away from COIN?  People getting exposure via and ETF are likely buy and hodlers  who won't trade until the price is either much higher or lower than their entry.  So like, 2 trades or something similarly small.  Not much revenue there.  

We should also consider that it's likely that people who buy ETF shares probably wouldn't have bought off an exchange in the first place.  So, in reality, the ETF custodianship is just COIN making money off customers who probably wouldn't have used their shit in the first place.

Also, ETFs can't do ""like kind"" trades, so if they want more Crypto they need to go in the open market and actually buy it from COIN (or someone else).   They can't do a 1 for 1 shares to bitcoin swap that would otherwise reduce the fees they're paying to maintain the NAV.  That money goes to COIN.",-0.2,2024-02-16,9
They want to say we dont know fundamentals? 250% float isnt fundamental,3336,l6n6fx,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6n6fx/they_want_to_say_we_dont_know_fundamentals_250/,344,2021-01-28 09:17:16,"Investopedia💎💎💎 has this article talking about shorts and floats:

&#x200B;

Here's a couple key takeaways:

* Theoretically, the maximum amount of a company's float that could be shorted is equal to the float itself; although, in reality, it's rare for a stock to have a short interest greater than 50%.
* Short selling is an [advanced trading strategy](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trading-strategy.asp) used by investors to speculate on an expected price decline of a stock or other [security](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/security.asp).

Note that the fundamental here is that it shouldnt be above 50%💸💸💸 normally, let alone 100%. It shouldnt even be an idea under normal circumstances. We didnt create this non-fundamental scenario. They did.

Also note that shorting is called ""SPECULATION."" Speculation is not wise, well informed investing😒😒. They are betting and they always warn that it is betting. They warn non-stop that you should be very careful. They scare you away from these massive profit potentials and hide behind complex ideas.

Once they start losing, they suddenly change their tune 🎶🎶. They claim we arent paying attention to fundamentals. That we are inexperienced and making dumb moves. This is the most shrewd, clever, intelligent market move made since the Big Short. The institutional investors got caught with their pants down 😘 in public and blame us for calling them out on it.

AMC Volume Price Analysis,1952,nnriwg,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nnriwg/amc_volume_price_analysis/,624,2021-05-29 22:25:02,"  

Hey fellow traders. Today, l’ll present to you a very strong bull case on AMC that is not explained by simply putting a rocket emoji (I love this emoji by the way) or because someone else posted a strong YOLO bet on the stock. Here is my analysis based on volume, price action, and a powerful pattern named the flag, high and tight.

&#x200B;

[Weekly chart](https://preview.redd.it/5bruexp383271.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&s=f679d9584a983071eaf036df2e4c5be14069eaae)

Firstly on the weekly chart, we see a high tight flag that started developing from the low on January 5th at $1.91 (#1) to the high of the pattern which was achieved on January 27th at a staggering price of $20.36 (#2). In 17 trading days, the stock soared 1065.96%. It’s an understatement that this price action caught my attention. The following months saw the stock consolidate in a flag, high and tight on falling volume. Bulkowski studied this pattern extensively and it’s one of his favorites. HTF is characterised by a rise of at least 90% (aim for double) in less than 2 months followed by a consolidation period on ideally falling volume. I think we easily meet these criteria! The performance rank of this pattern in his work is 1 on 23 in a bull market (1 being the best) with an average rise of 69% and throwbacks happening 54% of the time. Price meets target 90% of the time. The measure rule helps us acquire a potential price target for this trade. In his work, Bulkowski tells us to measure the rise and project it 50% past the breakout point. With the measure rule, using the breakout point at $12, we would have a theoretical price target of $63.96 (1065.96/100/2\*12)). Now to the analysis based on volume and price.

On the weekly chart, we have the breakout on #3 with rising and above average volume. This confirms the breakout is not fake, but supported by the professionals. After the minor pullback, we see the momentum exploding and the price action ripping past $20 on very high volume. Like we will see on the daily chart, the last trading day of the week saw some heavy selling which can be seen with the long upper wick on the weekly chart. 

I attribute this to two things. First, the stock rose to overbought levels and a pullback was imminent. Two, the stock hit the ATH of around $35 and many market participants saw this as a good point to take profits.  While it is true the SI rose in this period, I do not believe shorts created this long upper wick. Seems more likely professionals were taking money off the table. This being said, I do not think we are witnessing a trend end since strong momentums like this one cannot be broken in a single day. Like a big cargo ship, it cannot be stopped simply by turning off the engine. More effort will be necessary to break this rocket for sure. On top of that, the most conservative assessment would bring us to $63.96 in less than 30 days (around June 10th) following the breakout and we have a 90% chance of hitting this target according to Bulkowski. If these are not good odds, I don’t know what is. I truly believe this is an opportunity of a lifetime!

&#x200B;

[Daily chart](https://preview.redd.it/wslu122983271.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a1d2f718d41538d8bfad7ffad44ade99c796356)

On the daily chart, we can see the flag, high and tight develop from January 27th on #2 to the breakout at #3 on May 13th. Developing this cause is important according to Wyckoff’s law of cause and effect. The development of a cause will be proportional to the subsequent effect. On May 14th (breakout day (#4)), we see rising and above average volume that confirms the start of a new trend. Then, the test of supply on the pullback at #5, we see falling volume until the stock reaches $12 which means there is no interest in selling at these prices. The rally resumes on very nice long white candles on steadily rising volume which means volume and price are in harmony fully supported by the great professionals. 

On the second to last candle, we see some selling happening as shown with the upper wick. On #6, we see a tall black candle that closes very close to the prior day’s close. I associate this candle with the bearish meeting lines candle. Bulkowski’s work establishes the candle to be a continuation pattern 51% of the time in a bull market, which is pretty much as valid as a coin toss. If the next day’s close is below this candle, Bulkowski tells us there is a 70% chance the candle acts as a reversal. So this is to be looked at closely for next week. The long upper wick and shorter lower wick associated with very high volume tells me there was more selling happening Friday by the professionals. 

We must remember that stocks do not trend in a straight line. Volatility is cyclical, and all this is normal price action. Even in the event that Friday’s price action is stopping volume by the great professionals and the beginning of a distribution phase, Wyckoff’s work tells us this is associated with a potential preliminary supply and this stopping action ALWAYS fails and thus the rally WILL continue. Ladies and gents, I cannot stress enough how AMC is trading currently at a discount and any entry point is a good one at this point in time. We do not choose our seats on a rocket ship! You get in, strap on, and enjoy the ride! Trying to perfectly time the bottom on any pullback is a fool’s errand! Looking back at the daily chart on AMC, #1 (hanging man) and #3 (dark cloud cover) shows us that any bearish candle in the recent history of this stock is likely to be very short lived. Shorting this stock based on the bearish meeting lines (weak bearish candle by the way) would be a very dangerous endeavour indeed.

[30 minutes chart](https://preview.redd.it/erdc846b83271.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ec91557abfecf685c4af681eaf68f0da6a1fd9b)

Lastly, on the 30 minutes chart, friday we see at #1 strong buying pressure as seen with the long lower wick and high volume at $25.50. #2 was a retest on falling volume meaning falling interest to sell at this price. I do believe we have strong support at this level.

No one has a crystal ball and this could go either way, but the odds are that we reach $63.96 by the end of June with a 90% probability according to Bulkowski. I am adding to my position at any dip in this stock. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qbs706tc83271.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&s=8669186d98ef0792b216b50992969cd1d08fe785

If history is of any guide, I expect AMC to have a short consolidation period with falling volume like we saw with GME before the great run up. Thus, I believe we have another week to add to our positions before this really takes off. Any close above 35$ will be extremely bullish

I’ve been reading many posts explaining the short squeeze potential and this adds to the excitement of a strong bull run in this stock way past $63.96. AMC is currently the most shorted stock in the market as we speak. Though I have doubts that AMC will reach 500k like many claim, I do believe we have a strong squeeze potential in this stock as shown by the candles and volume recently printed on the charts. Ultimately, volume and price will tell us when it is time to close our positions.

Cheers,

20$ 07/16C AMC

30$ 07/16C AMC

Edit: Just to be clear, Bulkowski’s HTF gives us a 90% chance to hit the target in the next 30 days after the breakout. This target is his CONSERVATIVE target not MY target. I do NOT plan to sell at this target. I have no price target at this time since it could squeeze to 10k for all I know.

This quarter’s scoreboard is expected to glow from a bullish cryypto pricing streak, with top-dog tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum fetching high tags, and the market's volatility and interest—from casual crypto fans to big-league institutional players—hitting new highs.

Metrics central to COIN’s heartbeat—Verified Users, Monthly Transacting Users, Trading Volume, and Assets on Platform—are all expected to be on the up and up.

With crypto’s market cap on a climb, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, subscription and service revenues are looking buff. Fee revenues are also predicted to get a boost, thanks to a more diverse trading volume mix. COIN’s own crystal ball pegs subscription services revenues around $300 mil for the quarter.

Transactions should rake in more cash, with consumer and institutional sources pouring in. Wall Street’s crystal ball sees revenues reaching $650.8 million for the quarter, a 10.2% year-over-year climb. Yet, COIN isn’t without its drama—increased market competition could be a party crasher.

Costs-wise, COIN's expecting tech and dev to clock in between $575 million and $625 million, while marketing expenses might be munching through $80 to $90 million. But COIN's got its eyes on the cost-cutting prize, likely beefing up its adjusted EBITDA.

COIN bets transaction expenses will hit mid-teens percentage of revenues, while tech and dev costs should shrink thanks to slicker ops.

In a plot twist for COIN and the crypto world, the dreary low-volume trade narrative might be yesterday’s news. October saw Bitcoin prices rocket 28% to $34,400 amid whispers that the SEC might greenlight a Bitcoin ETF, sparking a trading frenzy.

This rally preps the stage for the Bitcoin ""halving"" spectacle next April—past editions have sparked crypto gold rushes.

COIN's not just playing the markets—it’s dropping “[perpetual futures](https://www.coinbase.com/advanced-trade/perpetuals)” for the global betters and pushing beyond trading to morph into a crypto ecosystem nucleus. From staking services for token yield farming to launching its own dev playground blockchain, Base, COIN’s all in on crypto diversity.

But it’s not all moonlight and roses—COIN's duking it out with the SEC over allegations of being an unlicensed securities bazaar, a spat COIN rebuffs. The stakes? Analysts whisper a regulatory smackdown could slash COIN’s revenues by a third.

COIN's chiefs are bullish, banking on outpacing the SEC and building a crypto empire. Regulatory clouds loom, yet if the bulls keep running, COIN's short-term ride could be a thrill. COIN is already up almost 8% today, so it would be silly to get calls, right? They aren't exactly at a ""discount"" today. The 11/03 90c are already up 253%. I'm just gonna go light on them at grab it at $105 (at the time of writing).",0.0,2023-11-02,17

I am personally scratching my neck and doing my best Dave Chappelle impression waiting on the market to open. The only benefit I have is that I am in Scotland and therefore in the future compared to My Fellow American Degenerates. Because of this, I have advanced 20/20 hindsight on this situation. To be clear, this is not a ""forget $GME/$AMC/$BBBY, try growing beetroot"" post from Yahoo Finance. This is an observation from multiple meme stock spikes over the last two years. Therefore, due to completely anecdotal evidence that is backed by zero technical research, I believe $COIN will go north of $120 in the next two weeks. The reason for this is based around the rise of alternate currencies during the same periods as the previous spikes and the recent decline of various coin prices followed by a surprising reversal and trend upwards. I currently do not hold a position in $COIN but will be purchasing both shares and calls at market open. I guarantee\* I am not wrong. Godspeed.

"COIN is oversold on ""fee compression"" and is getting no credit for their cloud service.",35,oj3yb4,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oj3yb4/coin_is_oversold_on_fee_compression_and_is/,73,2021-07-13 05:40:03," I keep seeing articles promoting the idea that Coinbase is just an exchange, and is therefore overvalued due to near term fears of fee compression. 

 This logic is erroneous on a few points:

1. Coinbase customers care more about security than low fees. Even today there are exchanges you can use to save money on trading fees. They're still raking in cash on trading volumes and growing customers and assets on platform. This is going to continue because the coinbase brand carries a lot of trust. At least here in the US, it feels like common knowledge that coinbase is the safest place for your assets, analysts aren't giving them enough credit for this.
2. Coinbase brings more utility to the table than other exchanges. Syncing with their wallet and earn services for example, is starting to feel like being sucked into the Apple ecosystem. It's too damn convenient, users won't leave. If you think they won't continue releasing value-add-services over time then you're just as retarded as your username suggests.
3.  AND MOST IMPORTANTLY; Coinbase isn't just an exchange. They're a tech company, and they're leveraging the work they've done that interacts with the underlying technologies and exposing them as an API; and guess what, they're going to make more money on this in 5 years than their trading fees (so says me). If you believe in the ""internet money"" economy, then you also believe there is a tidal wave of startups around the corner, and that all over the world people will start getting paid with ""internet money"" (instead of gum). If you're an entrepreneur, and especially if you're a developer who values their time, you're not going to work on stuff that's out of scope, you're just going to plug in something you can trust.

I literally haven't seen anyone talking about this, I think investors will wake up to it in the 2nd half of this year.

Maybe after Q2 earnings release if Coinbase cloud revenue is non-zero.

If you haven't listened to the Q1 Earnings call (of course you haven't) you really should.

I really don't see any legitimate competition to Coinbase, there are many exchanges, but Coinbase is building something much more important. In my mind the only real risk facing Coinbase is that the entire ""internet money"" economy never materializes and we just keep using fiat forever.

TLDR Edit:  I lost money, BTC going up I think, MARA best mining company in all of Kasakstan.

I’ve got the next DFV play, so listen up fellow cashiers and cashierettes.

First, loss porn attached you filthy animals. My wife’s boyfriend thought it was hilarious when I cried and you probably will too.

Now, on to the play. I’ve dabbled with buttcorn and MARA forever. I was playing MARA after my first $200k run (stock that shall not be mentioned), so I know how to lose money on their options like the back of my hand. Last week I was anticipating a BTC bull run, so loaded up on MARA for earnings and then loaded up even more the day after and lost it all. 1400 contracts expired worthless. I turned $10,000 into $400,000 with FROG and SQ and a couple others last week and luckily pulled $300k out. The $100k left turned into $200k in like 4 different accounts with MARA and then I lost it all on Friday, hence the graph. I decided to take some Adderall and deep dive into MARAs numbers to see how I messed up so bad. Turns out, I’m an idiot, who knew? Any who, here’s the highlights of my drug binge.

We’re looking at this from a supply and demand perspective.

Halving events cut BTC supply in half. WOWZIE! SO SMART! If demand stays the same and supply is cut in half, the value of that item skyrockets.

So why is BTC going to stay in demand? First people are now putting a portion of their 401k into kriptoe. Sweet! Those funds have to buy no matter what the price is. Notice all the funds made damn sure their funds were set up before the halving. This is why the BTC bull run is starting early this time around.

We aren’t even close to FOMO. 50% gains in a month is nothing. 50% a week for a couple weeks and people are going to be dumping their life savings into BTC. Markets are forward looking and the funds are allowing the big boys.

Countries are adopting it, basement dwellers are still sinking their 75 cents they found under the couch pillows into it., only 2 mil BTC left, a ton of BTC is missing, etc.

I ran comparisons of lows to highs during previous halvings. $12-$230, $650-$19,350, and $9,600  to $68,000. Based on that, we are looking at $425k a coin to $800k a coin or between 9 and 17 trilly. This would be around 10% of the top 10 currencies market cap, or gold at 14 T. Makes sense, right?

So, now we are 107% sure that BTC is moon bound, which company are we picking? We want something that grows exponentially with BTC growth and is stable enough to survive the halving in case something goes wrong. MARA is the obvious choice.

First, miners are getting DESTROYED because of the upcoming halving (rightfully so). They are shorted soooo fucking hard right now. Makes sense. They are down even if BTC is up. Miner sentiment will slowly start shifting if BTC takes off. MARA has 1.5 billion in cheddar as well as the option to sell shares for another 1.5 B (which is a good thing and has been accounted for in the share price already) for scooping up loser miner bros that can’t weather the storm. They have an insane hash rate, which is all that matters in this game. Getting as much BTC as fast as possible. Oh, you get power credits for turning your miners off on peak energy time? WHO GIVES A SHIT? Who wants a mining company that doesn’t mine?

So I took MARA and compared to their current value, subtracted half the short interest, and calculated out their value at $400k a coin and came up with $400 per share on the conservative side. If I go with aggressive (aka insane) assumptions for coin price, hash rate, and getting rid of all short interest, we are looking at $1700 per share.

My biggest concerns are timing and BTC dumping. I figure I have a 50/50 shot.

So, I dumped like $50k into this. $30s for April 4 and $40s for June 21st. One last yolo. Either the kids can afford new shoes, or they are gonna have to learn to scavenge food out of the school trash can. I’m trying to figure out how to move some of my roth into this play as well. I’ll probably dump another $20k tomorrow from my Robinhood. I’m riding this to the bottom or to a multi-millionaire, no in-between.

A bearish-ish case for MindMed,1611,n0bkvn,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n0bkvn/a_bearishish_case_for_mindmed/,531,2021-04-28 15:42:13,"Okay  so you've read the shitload of [bullish god-tiered DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mzxtz5/mnmd_starter_due_diligence/) about Mindmed, you  like getting high to forget all the red in your portfolio and you feel  the urge to bust what's left of your retirement into a meme biotech  stock. Yet your weak ass paperhanded reptilian brain is scared. Here's  why.

**The product**  : So basically like almost all its competitors ([atai-linked](https://www.atai.life/programs/), [numinus](https://numinus.ca/clinics), [cybin](https://www.cybin.com/), etc) this company decided not  to invest in any meaningful drug discovery. Instead they bought  pipelines for well known compounds. Bonus, you can say on your website  you already passed the ""pre discovery"" stage. No shit. It's done since  the '50s. Candy-flipping is not ""next-gen"", sorry. Ibogain derivatives  are not that good.

**The market :** Psychedelics work, right? Yeah.

* For  MDD (depression), they are only slightly more efficient than first  intent antidepressants. And how efficient are antidepressants? Well not much.  They have NNT ranging between 7 and 20. What's a NNT? Wait you were  going to invest in a FUCKING BIOTECH without knowing what a NNT is? NNT  (number needed to treat) indicate how good something is relative to a  control. With a NNT of 7, an antidepressant will beat doing nothing 1  time out of 7. Yup. **That's shit**.  Why? Because we know jackshit about how depression really works, and  however smooth our brains are, it appears they still remain very  complicated thing (I guess that's a good thing?).What does it mean? It  means LSD, Shrooms, or whatever shitty therapy you can imagine with  psychedelics will work for some and won't for the others. Which means  MNMD will have to share the MDD market with the approx. **50** other fucking antidepressants. Also J&J's Spravato is less invasive and has better results.
* For  anxiety. Is it gonna be the same? NO. MNMD is right on that one. The  NNT of benzos is approx. 3 depending on the study. LSD is estimated to  be around 2. That's nice.  But don't pre-order your lambo yet. Benzos  are fucking easy to use, and they are addictive. Many people won't  tolerate psychedelics, won't have the time for it, or are afraid of the  compound to begin with (thx war on drugs). The pharma industry won't let  a hipster's biotech ruin its profits. So they'll either lobby against  (if you are a physician it's good news, more free cruises in the coming  years) or bring their own psychedelic drugs on the table (and they'll be  better than acid). Acid antagonists will just compound problems. All their pipeline is based on the premise that they can safely stop a trip with this antagonist. Else the patient will be tripping balls for too long, making the treatement unpractical compared to other psychedelics and state-of-the-art anxiolytics. That mean pushing 2 pipelines plus a combined drug pipeline to reach market.
* For addiction. Didn't find anything bearish about it except that it might not get approved, like for any other biotech.
* ADHD. There's no exclusive market in selling microdosed lsd, but it might just work. The data isn't here to predict the success of the therapy yet.

**The IP :**  It's gonna be a fucking bloodbath. Almost all the psychedelic biotech  decided to work with the same exact compounds because they are inept at  innovation (more below). There gonna be a lot of overlap, and many  lawsuits. Even better, almost all the IP I found related to the  psychedelics applications is very badly written, and, put mildly, trash.  Bullish on IP law firms.

**The people :**   In biotech, the idea isn't worth anything. Execution is the only thing  that matter (and luck). So who's behind MNMD? They have anywhere between 25 and 40 employees depending on how you count,  good thing if you [work there](https://www.linkedin.com/company/mindmedco/people/), you'll have a nice title for your resume as  you're either a C-suite or a director or at least a lead. And most of  them don't work-work for MNMD, they are just consultants, or also work  on some other stuff on the side, because well, you don't need that much  businessmen in such a young biotech.They outsourced all of their  innovation capacities to their academic collaborators. Which is smart.  Or not. It will make scaling up extremely tedious without acquiring  everybody else. They don't have the chemical know-how, and neither the  patents, to produce. They'll need to partner with a big pharma or  buy/merge someone, which will considerably reduce the profits. They also  don't have much expertise in regulatory affairs either so that's 1 more  (costly) outsourcing. Their current philosophy is ""throw money at it"".  Which has been proven to fail in the biotech/pharma world, see eroom's  law. What about the AI guys (the whole handful of them)? They come from the famous  HealthMode (and also related Merlon) company. Never heard of them?  Because they never put a product on the market.Basically the company is a  weird employee merger between weed company veterans, an obscure 2 California based Czechoslovak AI companies and some expensive-ass  consultant-executives.

TL;DR : Mindmed is  trying hard to appear as the next big thing but all they have is a  highly contested pipeline of low-innovation drugs. They are stretched  thin between Drug Development and AI and lack the proper verticality to  achieve success, but are too high-level to succeed as an horizontal  growth company. Ride the hype while it lasts i guess.

GME Trading Strategy to Catalyze the Squeeze,2760,m5wglc,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m5wglc/gme_trading_strategy_to_catalyze_the_squeeze/,271,2021-03-16 06:00:51,"I made a comment yesterday on a post that did some technical analysis on GME, and several people asked that I turn that comment into a post, so here it is.

Obviously I'm going to start by saying all of this is based on my opinion of what needs to happen to spark the squeeze.

**First, the comment as it was:**

*I've seen lots of bullish TA on GME. Keep in mind, ALL TA requires volume to play out how it should. We haven't had any volume on GME in over a week.

Holding shares simply isn't enough - needs constant (all day every single day) buying of shares and IN THE MONEY options.

If you buy options that are 20-30% in the money they literally can't price pin because they can't get and keep the price 20-30% below current market. So you force immediate share buying by market makers to hedge, and virtually eliminate their means of counter-attack which has been price pinning at the point of maximum pain (price at which most contracts expire worthless).

If you are intending to help push the squeeze, buy shares throughout the day every day. If you are playing options, mostly buy calls in the money. If you're buying OTM calls, buy as close to current price as you can afford. The more imbalanced OTM calls are, the more they're just going to price pin at maximum pain. They literally cannot do this if there is a ridiculous amount of new ITM call interest that they have to buy shares to hedge.*

Essentially, we cannot rely on normal technical indicators for movement with Gamestop. There are two major reasons. 

1. Manipulation. We cannot do anything about this really, aside from buy and hold. Technicals actually have a tendencies to work in reverse when a stock is being manipulated at these levels. The shorts, while stuck in a stupid position, aren't stupid. They know when the TA is indicating a bullish setup, and that is the best time for them to attack the stock to break the setup.

2. Volume. All technical setups require volume to play out. If volume doesn't follow, the technical setup fails and the price action is unpredictable. Except in this case, it goes down because it's being shorted at every chance.

So what do we need to do? Hold? Yes. But that can't be it. If we are doing nothing but holding, this will be a stalemate that they will probably win as sections of retail gets bored or impatient. They can literally hold us in a stalemate for months/years if volume never shows up to move the price. *Yes, they pay more interest the longer they have to wait. They'll just manipulate other sectors of the market to force gains and cover their losses unless the SEC steps in to stop market manipulation.* 

#Volume

Without volume, there is no endgame. Look at every day we've had spikes. Look at the volume. Now look at the past week or two. We aren't making progress because nobody is buying shares, aside from some whale algos that are simply fighting off the short attacks. Believe it or not, the whales do need retail support to force the squeeze. The whales are the ones creating momentum from time to time. If it catches on, they can follow it up. But if they just go all out to create a surge and nobody follows behind them to buy, they are literally risking billions of dollars to fail.

This thing will likely happen in waves over the course of a few days. If you look at any day, there are surges in buy volume, but they're short. That's likely a whale, testing the market. If they see confirmation/follow-up from the market, it's less risky for them to send a second wave of buying pressure. So it will be something like, whale buy, retail confirmation buys, whale buy, runaway effect, gamma squeeze and then finally short squeeze. All of those things have to happen consecutively, fluidly and fairly quickly to beat any kind of counter attack.

Now this is going to sound counterintuitive, but in order to catalyze the squeeze, we have to stop just buying the dip. When volume picks up and the price is spiking, that's the most important time to buy. That's the point when additional buying pressure is most important. And until the retail market confirms pressure on one of those spikes, we are going to keep bouncing back and forth.

#Options

The other side of the coin is options purchases. **Stop devoting the majority of your capital to far OTM lotto tickets.** This helps the short positions, because it forces the market makers to help the shorts. Market makers that sell call options have to hedge their risk. When you buy an $800c, it does two things.

1. They don't have to buy very many shares up front to remain risk neutral.

2. In incentivizes the market makers to pin the price.

You can do some additional reading on max pain price in options, but it is essentially the closing price at which the largest number of options expire worthless. When you buy OTM call options, you're increasing the maximum pain price, which makes it easier for market makers (and shorts) to pin the price there.

If, however, you're buying a ton of ITM call options, you're doing two things:

1. Deep ITM calls have a delta of essentially 1.00. This means that in order to remain risk neutral, the market makers essentially has to buy 100 shares immediately upon selling you the contract.

2. It lowers the max pain price by creating an imbalance towards lower strikes having the most OI. This means in order to pin the price at max pain, they would need to drop it from it's current price.

Not only do you force market makers to be risk neutral immediately (meaning they don't care where the price goes), you also force them to immediately put buying pressure on the stock price.

If you must buy OTM calls, buy ones that are at least closer to being ITM. The further OTM you buy calls, the more likely the price will go sideways. You can also sell calls and roll them into higher prices to remain leveraged as the price increases. Once it achieves a runaway squeeze, which will be easy to identify, you can start buying your lotto tickets.

Tl;dr: In my opinion, if you want to help catalyze the squeeze, you need to buy shares when the price is spiking and buy calls that are at least 10-20% in the money.
