Im not a geh ber usually but this shit has to go down.

10k delayed and 12b-25 extension granted for 15 days which also expired last monday and still no news. i dont understand how this is kept so quiet. sounds like wirecard 2.0 to me.

Pomerantz Law Firm filing class action is no joke either.

I cant wrap my head around how this shithole is up 4% pre market. im getting puts now.

TLDR: SMCI got accused by hindenburg for shady business then missed their annual reporting deadline on 08/30 and filed for extension. Extension ended 09/16 and still no report. Class action suits filed. Stock was down on news in August but went up since then.. so puts.",0.1,2024-09-19,2

I'm sure you could debate if they would claim that this is all AI server related. However, If they are inflating thier numbers by 50 to 75% that would be bad for the evaluation of the entire AI server market.  

Dell

Gemini AI:... In the first QUARTER of 2024, Dell Technologies' AI-optimized server orders increased to $2.6 billion, and shipments increased more than 100% sequentially to $1.7 billion...

HPE

Gemini AI:...While HPE (HPE) saw its total server revenue jump 18% in its fiscal second QUARTER to $3.86 billion...

Yes, I know there are other companies out there that make AI HW like Lenovo. I'm just saying that the sales that these trendy companies are receiving from AI HW specifically is about on par with what SMCI is claiming on thier reports related to AI.

I've been using SMCI hardware for 15+ years.  It's cheaper, than HP, Dell Cisco, Lenovo and that's about it, it doesn't have any technical advantage.  Their support, and IPMI is sub par, quality can be hit or miss.  I've used them on off, depending on budgets.  

I've been in datacenters in Asia seen the same no name hardware with the same design as Super micro, the power supplies, air shrouds, everything was interchangeable and fit.  I could probably slide in a blade from these cheap no name server into their blade chassis and it'd all run fine. There's nothing inherently special or AI about SMCI hardware.

I don't watch Cramer but I have to assume him or some network, bank is saying SMCI is some get rich AI play.  It's got a catchy AI buzz name but that's it.

https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bw9c8l/goldman_sachs_and_morgan_knowingly_offering_scams/

I didn’t know when the timing of the dump was but I said it’d be under $100 in the future before all the accounting fraud reports came.

Digging around and talking with people in the field be very careful when Coreweave get offered, it may pump, even for a year but their numbers are going to be cooked.
 

And as we see SMCI has the same circular money glitch selling/buying from his brother, wife’s company which are located inside the SMCI campus. So I don’t know the exact but it seems very fishy and makes me think PE loaned money to 2.6 billion to coreweave to pump up SMCI and NVDA revenue numbers and they are going dump on retail?

NVIDIA is now oversold ,2628,1ba22rc,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ba22rc/nvidia_is_now_oversold/,859,2024-03-09 04:29:58,"I'm an old school investor. I enjoy charts and dividends and reasonable sustainable growth over time. Today was a rough day for NVDA stock, but in the grand scheme of things, it was really just a Tuesday. 

The reality is, NVDA was up 7% this week, Monday-Friday. It's massive run up to $974, while exciting, was not healthy or sustainable and a pull back from the intraday open of 5% was a good thing. 

If you're measuring NVDA from it's daily high if 974 to it's close of $875; well, don't. It closed at $926 Thursday and was really just down 5% from that. The AH/Pre market etc on low volume artificially blew that open price up making today look much worse than it was....

So where does it go from here?

Here's the reality;

- AI is the future, we are at the starting line. There's are few precedents for this, so everyone saying it's over bought are missing a key element. The limit is unknown. NVDA very well could be the most valuable company on the planet. 4T market cap is not unreasonable, on continued growth as shown over the last several ERs. We've really just started to scratch the surface.

- NVDA competition is non -existent. They have at least 2 years of runway before anyone can even reasonably expect to be even close to in a position to compete. Even then, NVDA will have advanced and have the advantage. 

- Everyone needs AI chips. They need them because customers are demanding AI, and thus more h100s need to be bought. The demand for AI hasnt slowed. It remains and is accelerating daily. NVDA will continue to make record profits for the foreseeable future as the only real game in time to provide the chips requires to build this new industry.

- Today's sell-off was orchestrated by the big boys (look at how quickly and how well timed it was,) but the big boys will be back in next week, taking advantage of the now cheaper stocks and using the 600% gains from the puts they bought before triggering the sell off to get back on the ride. 

-NVDA is an easy candidate for a split. Whether it happens at $1000 or $850 is irrelevant. But it's coming, and retail will cheer it.

Tldr

BERS are fukt, NVDA gonna more sustainably climb next week another 7% ish next week to ~$922-$930. It will continue this way until $1000 likely between 3/22 and 3/27.

Stop worrying about AH and pre market movements on low volume. Start looking at the longer term growth..",0.0,2024-03-09,0
Why I believe Celsius is ready to make an SMCI like move (Deleted last post on accident),79,1b84zhr,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1b84zhr/why_i_believe_celsius_is_ready_to_make_an_smci/,117,2024-03-06 22:35:32,"I deleted my last DD post on accident. Here I go again...

First off, yes I understand comparing CELH and SMCI is completely ridiculous. I do not believe that CELH will go above $1,000 as SMCI is a once in a lifetime move and is a top AI stock right now. BUT, I do believe CELH is getting ready to gear up towards $125-$150/share. Here is why...

I am a consolidation trader. I spend my free time looking for stocks that have been consolidating in ranges for weeks/months at a time. Yes I know, extremely boring but the patience is most definitely worth the reward. For example, I called SMCI back in a discussion on 1/9/24. I have attached the snapshot.

https://preview.redd.it/pidid85owqmc1.png?width=1442&format=png&auto=webp&s=344b86e89048ddb7473751a4e85614204789e581

Once a stock breaks consolidation, I keep it on high watch. Generally, I like to watch the stock for the first 1-2 weeks after the breakout. If the breakout is caused by earnings or good guidance, even better. Trust me, just look at SMCI lol Once the move is on, I follow William Oneil's 8-week hold rule. I will go into that a little later but you will notice numbers next to the weekly candles on my charts.

Lets get into the charts,

SMCI:

https://preview.redd.it/cejumtbrwqmc1.png?width=1458&format=png&auto=webp&s=d86b0f9a21ecfe1123eca2202b8d3f088d31196f

\-33 weeks of consolidation

\-Stock was well over 20% in the first 1-3 weeks after the breakout

CELH:

https://preview.redd.it/phlpnyuswqmc1.png?width=1462&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a464b636bae20e0b92f43c1e61c244bc0370307

\-36 weeks of consolidation

\-Stock is well over 20% in the first 2 weeks after the breakout

William Oneil says, if a stock is up 20%+ after the first 1-3 weeks after a breakout, you should hold the stock for 8 weeks and reevaluate your positions after that 8th week. Interestingly enough, this is technically SMCI's 8th week. If you listened to William Oneil, you held SMCI from around 400 to now and did not get shaken out once.

After looking at Monster (MNST), it is very clear that the market reacts well to caffeine and Celsius is really starting to make a push towards Monster and Red Bull status.

Position: 11 $125 CELH calls for 4/19 that I plan on holding until 4/19. I will look to add on down days because there will most certainly be down days.

NVDA is Worth $1000+ This Year - AI Will Be The Largest Wealth Transfer In The History of The World - Sam Altman Wasn't Joking...,2335,1aqf0zb,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1aqf0zb/nvda_is_worth_1000_this_year_ai_will_be_the/,945,2024-02-14 10:40:49,"**UPDATE2: Open AI Release Massive Update SORA Text/Speech to Video**

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEuEMwU45Hs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEuEMwU45Hs)

**UPDATE: Sam Altman Tells the World (literally** [The World Governments Summit](https://youtu.be/JVatgo0TJIw?si=3-Jkw9F3ZlkilulX&t=61)**) that** [GPT-5 Is Going To Be a Big Deal](https://youtu.be/-Mca6eN81Is?si=Ym59zLD2VZ2yefZU) **- GPT-5 Will Be Smarter Across The Board - Serious AGI in 5 - 10 Years.**

**THIS IS WAR - And Nvidia is the United States Military Industrial Complex, The Mongol Empire, and Roma combined.**

AI will be as large as the internet and then it will surpass it. AI is the internet plus the ability to reason and analyze anything you give it in fractions of a second. A new unequivocal boomstick to whomever wants to use it.

The true winners will be those startups in fields such as robotics, healthcare, pharmaceuticals, space-aeronautics, aviation, protein synthesis, new materials and so, so much more who will use AI in new and exciting ways.

Boston dynamics, set to boom. Self-driving robotaxis, set to boom. Flying taxis, set to boom. Job replacement/automation for legacy industry jobs white collar, set to boom. Personal AI agents for your individual workloads, booming. Healthcare change as we know it (doctors won't like this but too bad), set to boom.

The amount of industry that is set to shift and mutate and emerge from AI in the next 3 - 5 years will be astonishing.

I can tell you, standing on principal, that OpenAI's next release will be so game changing that nobody will deny where AI is heading. There is not a rock you can hide under to be so oblivious as to not see where this is going.

The reason why I bring up the next iteration of ChatGPT, GPT5, is because they are initiators of this phenomenon. Other, such as Google (and others) are furiously trying to catch up but as of today the 'MOAT' may be upon us.

The reason to believe that one may catch up (or try like hell to) is from the amount of compute power from GPU's it takes to train an ungodly amount of data. Trillions of data points. Billions (soon to be Trillions) of parameters all simulating that of the synaptic neuron connections in which the human brain functions that in turn gives us the spark of life and consciousness. Make no mistake, these guys are living out a present day Manhattan project.

These people are trying to build consciousness agency with the all the world's information as a reference document at it's finger tips. Today.

And guess what. The only way these guys can build that thing - That AGI/ASI/GAI reality - Is through Nvidia.

These guys believe and have tested that if you throw MORE compute at the problem it actually GAINS function. More compute equals more consciousness. That's what these people believe and they're attempting it.

Here, let me show you what I mean. What the graph below shows is that over time the amount of data and parameters that are being used to train an AI model. I implore you to watch this video as it is a great easy to understand educational video into what the hell is going on with all of this AI stuff. It's a little technical but very informative and there are varying opinions. I pulled out the very best part in relation to Nvidia here. [AI: Grappling with a New Kind of Intelligence](https://youtu.be/EGDG3hgPNp8?si=L71CUbmqho3jhKEh&t=3768)

https://preview.redd.it/vk5twc041hic1.png?width=1318&format=png&auto=webp&s=a3d2bdf42cf25e1c04e940b2f61d0219871f2334

It's SO RIDICULOUS that you wouldn't be able to continue to see the beginning so they have to use a log plot chart. And as you see we are heading into Trillions of parameters. For reference GPT-4 was trained on roughly 200 billion parameters.

https://preview.redd.it/6cq17n5i1hic1.png?width=1327&format=png&auto=webp&s=830334aa7cdaddfa10d7f6512d10025f136076ed

It is estimated GPT-5 will be trained with 2-5 trillion parameters.

Sam Altman was dead ass serious when he is inquiring about obtaining $7 trillion for chip development. They believe that with enough compute they can create GOD.

So what's the response from Google, Meta and others. Well, they're forming ""AI """"Alliances"""""". Along with that they are going to and buying from the largest AI arms dealer on earth; Nvidia.

Nvidia is a common day AI Industrial Complex War machine.

**Sovereign AI with AI Foundries**

It's not just companies that are looking to compete it's also entire Nation States. Remember, when Italy banned GPT. Well, it turns out, countries don't want the United States building and implementing their AI into other country's culture and way of life.

So as of today, you have a battle of not just corporate America but entire countries looking to buy the bullets, tanks and missiles needed for this AI fight. Nvidia sells the absolute best bullets, the best guns, the best ammo one needs to attempt to create their own AI epicenters.

And it's so important that it is a national security risk to not just us the United States but to be a nation and not have the capability of AI.

Remember the leak about Q\* and a certain encryption being undone. You don't think heads of State where listening to that. Whether it was true or not it is now an imperative that you get with AI or get left behind. That goes just as much for a nation as it does for you as an individual.

When asked about the risk of losing out sales to China on Nvidia's last earnings call Jensen Huang clearly stated he was not worried about it because literally nations are coming online to build AI foundries.

**Nvidia's Numbers and The Power Of Compounding**

The power of compounding and why I think there share price is where it is today and has so much more room to grow. Let me ask you a question but first let me say that AWS's annual revenues are at \~$80/Y Billion. How long do you think with Nvidia's revenues of \~$18/Q Billion to reach or eclipse AWS at a 250% growth rate?

15 years? 10 Years? 5 years? Answer: 1.19 years. Ok let's not be ridiculous perhaps it's 200% instead.

5 years? Nope. 1.35 years.

Let's say they have a bad quarter and Italy doesn't pay up. 150%

5 years right? Nope. 1.62 years.

Come on they can't keep this up. 100%.

has to be 5 years this time. Nope. 2.15 years.

100% growth/2.15 years to 250% growth/1.19 years to reach 80 billion in annual revenues.

They're growth last year was 281%.

So wait, I wasn't being fair. I used $80 billion for AWS while their revenues last year where $88 Billion and Nvidia's last years 4 quarters where \~$33 Billion.

Here are those growth numbers it would take Nvidia to reach $88 billion.

At 279% =  0.73 years

At 250% = 0.78 years

At 200% = 0.89 years

at 100% = 1.41 years

Folks. That's JUST the data center. They are poised to surpass AWS, Azure and Google Cloud in about .73 to 1.5 years. Yes, you heard that right, your daddy's cloud company is about to be overtaken by your son's gaming GPU company.

When people say Nvidia is undervalued. This is what they are talking about. This is a P/S story not a P/E story.

[https:\/\/ycharts.com\/indicators\/nvidia\_corp\_nvda\_data\_center\_revenue\_quarterly](https://preview.redd.it/xa46amh0dhic1.png?width=1450&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e9116e55235991b1113713b5b7cd7d30c58d515)

This isn't Y2k and the AI ""dot-com"" bubble. **This is a reckoning.** This is the largest transfer of wealth the world has ever seen.

Look at the graph. Look at the growth. That's all before the next iteration of GPT-5 has even been announced.

I will tell you personally. The things that will be built with GPT-5 will truly be mind blowing. That Jetson cartoon some of you may have watched as a kid will finally be a reality coming to you soon in 2024/2025/2026.

The foundation of work being laid now is only the beginning. There will be winners and there will be loser but as of today:

**$NVDA** is fucking **KING**

For those of you who still just don't believe or are thinking this has to end sometimes. Or fucking Cramer who keeps saying be careful and take some money out and on and on. Think about this.

Everyone is using them from Nation States to AWS, Microsoft, Meta, Google, X. Everybody is using them.

I get it. The price of the stock being so high and the valuation makes you pause. The price is purely psychological especially when they are hitting so many data points regarding revenues. The stock will split and rightly so (perhaps next year) but make not mistake this company is firing on ALL cylinders. The are executing S Tier. Fucking Max 9000 MX9+ Tier. Some god level tier ok.

There will be shit money that hits this quarter with all the puts and calls. The stock may rescind this quarter who knows. All i'm saying is you have the opportunity to buy into one of the most prolific tech companies the world has ever known. You may not think of them as the Apples or the Amazons or the Microsoft's or the Google's and that's ok. Just know that they are 1000% percent legit and AI has just gotten started.

Position: 33% of my portfolio. Another 33% in$Arm. Why? Because What trains on Nvidia will ultimately run/inference on ARM. And 33% Microsoft (OAI light).

If OpenAI came out today public I would have %50 of my portfolio in OAI i'll tell you that.

This is something you should have and should own in your portfolio. It's up to you to decide how much. When you can pay your children's college. When you can finally get that downpayment on that dream house. When you can buy that dream car you've always wanted. Feel free to drop a thank you.

The thing is people are catching on to this and the market is now pricing one or less rate cuts which will lead to a bearish week and decline going forward 

2. The supply chain constraints that SCMI and AMD attributed to their less than stellar results are the same issues that NVDA will have been facing when they report their results. Ergo they will miss either revenue, eps, or guidance going forward

Both stocks and all semiconductor stocks are down bigly suddenly in last 25-30 minutes.

So, what happened?

I heard on CNBC that ASML, the Dutch semiconductor maker missed the earnings because of order slowdown from Samsung and TSMC. The ASML stock crashed and went down $67 or about 7%. And, almost all semiconductor stocks including NVDA, SMCI, AMAT etc went down about 2-3% in sympathy.

IMO, this is overreaction and has nothing to do with NVDA and SMCI. Being a risk taker, I just bought lot of ITM calls when NVDA was down at $862 and SMCI at $974. I think, both should recover provided no other bad news comes!

As a result of this, SMCI will most likely smash their earnings report of $8.10 per share in early august and hopefully make the stock reach above $1100, which is a 30% increase from what the share price is today.

Something's Off with SMCI Stock Price - Thoughts?,1,1en8hhu,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1en8hhu/somethings_off_with_smci_stock_price_thoughts/,53,2024-08-08 20:40:38,"I've been keeping an eye on SMCI (Super Micro Computer, Inc.) stock, and something just feels really off with the price action lately. I attached a graph that shows their earnings, revenue, and stock price trends over the last few years, and honestly, it’s pretty confusing.

Here’s what’s going on in the graph:

1. **Earnings & Revenue:** The company’s revenue (those brown bars) and earnings (green arrows and circles) have been steadily increasing, which you’d think would be a good thing for the stock price.
2. **Stock Price:** Despite the solid growth in earnings and revenue, the stock price (blue line) has been all over the place. There’s this huge spike to crazy highs and then a sharp drop. It just doesn’t seem to match up with how the company’s actually performing.

What’s really weird is that we’re still holding on to stocks we bought for $900 even though the price is now dropping below $500. It just doesn’t make sense logically. Usually, you’d expect a stock to go up steadily if a company’s doing well, not be this unpredictable.

Is anyone else noticing this strange behavior with SMCI? Why are we holding on despite the drop? Are we missing something here? I’d love to hear your thoughts because this just doesn’t add up for me.

AI trade reminds me of the telecom bubble at the turn of the century.,1123,1dezbsu,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1dezbsu/ai_trade_reminds_me_of_the_telecom_bubble_at_the/,654,2024-06-13 19:13:20,"Just wanted to share a few thoughts I have related to the current state of the AI buildout and get your feedback.

The AI buildout reminds me a lot of the late 90s and early 00s when there was a race to build out large telecommunications networks to provide the bandwidth to support all of the new activity that would take place on the rapidly rising technology. 

Companies like Cisco and Lucent went parabolic as a large number of embedded providers (AT&T, Verizon, Comcast, etc) and new entrants (Qwest, Level 3, Global Crossings, etc) received large amounts of capital to build out new IP networks.

The problem was that the investment in network infrastructure greatly outpaced people’s ability to monetize it.  It took nearly two decades to absorb the network capacity glut and there were only a couple winners when it was all said and done, with a ton of companies absorbed and destroyed in its wake.  Cisco still hasn’t reached its all time high over two decades later and Lucent and other equipment providers lost a ton of value and were absorbed as demand for their products declined sharply.  And the winners of the internet buildout were not the companies being touted during the dotcom bubble.

I feel like we’re in the early stages of a similar cycle.  NVDA is like the telco equipment providers with the added benefit of not having any real competition and there are so many companies rapidly deploying their chips to make sure they get in on the AI game.  I think NVDA will continue to soar until the buildout is complete.  Large companies like Microsoft, Google, and Apple are racing to build capacity just like the telecommunications service providers back in the day and there are a bunch of new entrants fighting for mindshare.  Unfortunately no one has really figured out how to monetize the technology yet.

My prediction is that the AI trade over the next two years will looks like the culmination of the telecommunications bubble.  Huge ramp over the next two years as companies race to build out capabilities, followed by a rapid decline as companies fail to figure out how to monetize the investment.  NVDA will stick around but after it reaches its ATH it will struggle like Cisco did after the capacity glut is reached and the folks that actually figure out how to monetize AI will be different than a lot of the companies that are being bet on now.

TLDR, u think we’re in the beginning of a bubble due to rapid capacity buildout, followed by a crash when the industry can’t monetize the technology fast enough to pay back the investment, and then steady growth as the technology matures and new entrants rise on new and unforeseen AI applications.

Then, this last week, this red week, we would still see buying in afterhours giving some hope for a recovery, to then again have sell-offs at open. This behavior fits the repositioning of large institutional investors who still have a lot of demand, but do not want to inflate the price too much. 

So, how does this behavior fit the repositioning of large institutional investors who still have a lot of demand for these semi-conductor stocks? Why is an observation on such behavior accompanied by a larger likelihood for the reason that these institutional investors are repositioning and still have demand?

Firstly, when large institutional investors buy a lot of a certain stock during after hours, this inflates the stock price due to lower liquidity. Then, secondly, if the large institutional investors sell off a lot of their shares of this stock at market demand when the market opens, they can sell them for the relatively higher price as the stock won't drop as much as it would have when they sold those shares in afterhours. There is more liquidity in regular trading hours.

Thus, they make a profit. That profit is not huge, but allows the strategy to be sustainable. Because, the real goal of the strategy is to influence the market to sell off as well. Upon seeing those incredible heights reached in afterhours or premarket, people get nervous, and then when a large drop happens at open, some of the nervous ones will sell off. Therefore, not only will they turn a slight profit, but new shares will become available to them at lower prices as well. The stock price will drop to a point where the large institutional investors can safely enter a large position again during regular trading hours, which then does not inflate the stock price as much due to the higher liquidity. Then, when regular trading ends, they inflate the price again, sell off again, etc. As a result, the institutional investors are able to increase their position size relative to the rest of the world while holding the price somewhat stable. Given that shares of big names are often owned mostly by large corporations like BlackRock, it would make sense for them to manipulate the market in this legal way so that they can gain similarly large positions in stocks which are approaching those big names.

However, that does mean that at some point, the weak hands will be shaken and those shares will be in their pockets; the aftermarket strategy will not work any more, and any buying they do from that point onwards will inflate the current bubble even more. For these reasons, I believe the poppening won't happen for a long time. Diamond hands baby.

SMCI - this is far from over,32,1f4xep2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1f4xep2/smci_this_is_far_from_over/,30,2024-08-30 20:30:21,"SMCI has some nice niche products, but SMCI’s margins are tiny because they offer nothing proprietary.  
I have a feeling that they were on a roll, but the management couldn't quite keep up with success and the stock went up too high in valuation believing the company internally could keep up with the pressure.

For a company which has no moat, has shrinking margins and is again encompassed in accounting problems, I don't see an upside. I can understand that mistakes happen, but this is becoming a pattern recidivist behavior, and in my book, the trust is seriously shaken, if not lost.

I can understand skepticism around Hindenburg report, but withholding the release of annual report (10-K) is a big no no. Some jumped to SMCI's defense that they did so because of Hindenburg report to make double-checks, but why would you need to double-check a report which was previously audited by independent party (EY) and is supposed to be ready for submitting weeks ahead of deadline?  
For those that aren't aware, 10-K is a kind of report that contains comprehensive overview of company's financial performance over the past fiscal year, but also includes audited financial statements, unlike quarter reports which are less detailed and are unaudited ([link to 10-Q](https://app.quotemedia.com/data/downloadFiling?webmasterId=90423&ref=318292688&type=HTML&symbol=SMCI&cdn=f006c6d17a8677ce2f9e8b184a14bbb0&companyName=Super+Micro+Computer+Inc.&formType=10-Q&formDescription=General+form+for+quarterly+reports+under+Section+13+or+15%28d%29&dateFiled=2024-05-06)). 10-K also includes discussion and analysis (MD&A), risk factors, organizational structure, executive compensation, subsidiaries, and more.

Moreover, there are reports that buyers (such as CoreWeave, Tesla, Amazon AWS, Digital Ocean, to name a few) are switching to competition (which has higher margins), and from being the top customer, to having Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang publicly endorsing their competiton ([“Nobody is better at building end-to-end systems of very large scale for the enterprise than Dell.”](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dell-escapes-nvidia-shadow-own-133820520.html)),one has to ask - what is really going on?

I believe that, at least partially, the reason lies in that (to quote [mod from SCMI subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/SMCI_Stock/comments/1emlh0s/comment/lklblb9/?context=3)) *SMCI was very cheap in 2022 and 2023 when the circumstances were different. Nobody knew about their success back then, which allowed them to avoid competition and actually increase sales and margins.*  
*Now is a different story: they are at diseconomies of scale and diluting shareholders to finance their operations. I wouldn’t be surprised to see SMCI drop to the 300s or lower and never recover because they are just a commodity company now.*  
Dell, HPE and Lenovo aren't resting and have joined the server building market in the meantime.

Institutions which haven't closed their positions already will have a hard time explaining why they kept their position when this stocks sinks even more.

Even insiders believe in everything so much, that the insider net stock purchases in last 12 months amount to 0. One would think that they would grab stocks with hands over fist with this ""great discount"", but I guess they don't want more shares.

Buybacks? With increased CAPEX and lower margins, the need for money for R&D, and with history of dilutions, I'd be more concerned of further dilutions.

To top it all of, in all these commotions, some of you might have missed a little interesting detail. On August 15, 2024 SMCI added Susie Giordano to it's board of directors. ([Link](https://ir.supermicro.com/governance/board-of-directors/person-details/default.aspx?ItemId=ce4d4770-623d-4e66-a6c9-2679d0c68221))  
Her background is law, and *Ms. Giordano has over 25 years of experience advising executive management and board directors on a wide range of topics, including strategy,* ***litigation, compliance, regulatory matters, corporate governance***, ESG, executive compensation, ***financial reporting, crisis management***\*, cybersecurity, human capital management, ***investor relations***, M&A, ***securities, shareholder engagement, and treasury matters***.  
To me, this is very peculiar timing. She gets appointed to board of directors just mere (12) days before Hindenburg reveals their report and before we find out about 10-K delay, indicating that there could be undisclosed problems and SMCI management is/was aware of it. Where there's smoke, there's fire.

With all that said, I am very bearish on this stock and will be buying long puts.

TL;DR: SMCI is a total dumpster fire - no moat, shrinking margins, losing big clients, and can't even get their 10-K out. Insiders aren't touching the stock, and now they're bringing in a lawyer - betting on this sinking ship with puts all day!",0.1,2024-08-30,11

Obviously, a spike that large would mean significantly larger gains for those who invest in SMCI beforehand compared to those who invest in NVDA. However, it isn't guaranteed that SMCI will increase at all due to NVDA's earnings and could instead pose a giant risk to investors.

Currently SMCI is trading around the $770 to $800 range and is crucial to the future of AI as they have partnerships with Nvidia and AMD, due to providing complementary AI server systems. Due to their partnerships, and the increasing demand for AI server systems, SMCI had their EPS increase significantly as their EPS forecast is around $8.00 per share, which is a major increase from last year, which was $3.51 per share. They also have a PE ratio that is lower than Nvidia and AMD at around 45, a foward PE of 21.79 and a PEG ratio of under 1. As a result of their PEG ratio being below 1, it means that the company is considered as undervalued, and a good investment to have.

Bless her but my mom and boomers have a way of warning about the top.

EDIT: I just think it’s way harder for a company like NVDA which owns 99% of datacenter GPU to keep that 99% and I already seeing AMD, QCOM, ARM, AMZN, MSFT, GOOG, Meta making their own and making in roads and chipping 1% here and there.  

Much like any IT person who worked in datacenters and colocations pre 2016 saw INTC own 99% of datacenter.  It was easy to see it’s very hard to keep 99% and when you lose a few % the “street” or “market” pivots quickly.  

5+ years ago I said AMD at $1.80 I said INTC would start shedding that 99% dominance.  

https://np.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/9v1n6f/amazon_web_services_aws_pricing_amd_vs_intel/e994dka/

When you own 99% of the market imo once the pivot happens, it’s almost like a landslide in stock price. And it moves in cycles, companies will buy a bunch of NVDA GPUs and they might add a little bit the next year or the year after but you won’t have large purchases.  No one is buying 1 billion dollars of GPUs every year or quarter.

Even the Gamma Squeeze on SMCI is Broken,110,1as1oaq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1as1oaq,48,2024-02-16 11:41:22,"There's definitely a hint of a gamma squeeze going on with SMCI, as anyone can see the stock has gone parabolic. When you take a look at the options chain expiring this week, there's significant volume at $1,000, $1,100 and even $1,200 (all over 10k contracts traded today) relative to open interest. Market makers, who have to stay neutral, are forced to buy up SMCI stock to hedge their delta exposure as these options get closer to being in the money. This buying activity, especially with just one day to expiration, is partly why we're seeing the price jump—it's a classic feedback loop you get with a gamma squeeze. We also saw an acceleration in momentum during the course of the past two weeks, with 50 point gains the past two Thursdays.

However, even the gamma squeeze looks sorta broken to me. Despite SMCI's share price rising, the implied volatility (IV) for near-the-money (NTM) puts is around double that of the calls, which is the opposite of what we typically see in a gamma squeeze (this is what is referred to as skew). This suggests a market bracing for a possible sharp downturn. High IV for puts increases the cost of hedging, which might discourage new call buying and could reduce the upward momentum from the gamma squeeze. With expiration so close, the rapid time decay, or theta, is eroding the value of these options quickly, which in turn could lead to a decrease in delta-hedging activities. 

I’ll be watching to see what happens tomorrow in the weekly options chains up until at least the March 15th contracts to see if positions are simply being rolled to later dates. If enough people start selling off their positions to realize gains or minimize losses, the stock might stabilize or even sharply retract, potentially breaking the already broken gamma squeeze.",-0.4,2024-02-16,4

We are still a bit far from launch date but this industry is about to explode and it’s time to load the boat. 

SpaceX will IPO during this time as the excitement will be at an ATH and Elon Muskito nows that.

Reasons why SMCI is the Next NVIDIA,0,1f3iq6u,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1f3iq6u/reasons_why_smci_is_the_next_nvidia/,26,2024-08-29 00:46:45,"
As you all know SMCI was once at 1200 six months ago, but because smart money in a bid to make profit sold their shares to retail traders all the way down to 400 …putting their profits in lame stocks that are yes outperforming the market …but those stocks aren’t SMCI.

Of course us retail traders on Reddit know more than these institutions. We also know it isn’t our fault we kept buying all the way down leaving many with a cost basis of $800. It’s their fault for wanting to put their money in better performing names.

Guess what though SMCI is the next Nvidia. They will regret the day they sold out of a company with profit margin pressures that loses customers to Dell and HPE. 

What makes SMCI the next NVDA…900 points. 

Yes SMCI may not have any propriety tech or moat, and yes they may not be the only server builder with liquid cooled servers, and yes they no longer get first dibs at NVDA GPU’s… but did those other companies stock go up 900 points in 3 months! The answer is NO…they did not. And that is why SMCI is the next NVDA. Sure it doesn’t innovate any IP and has a difficult time maintaining profit margins and keeping customers, but it did go up 900 points.

To hell with the smart money knowing more about fundamentals than the Reddit community.

I’m not saying to make a play because I don’t know how long this will take to play out but this company literally has no AI tech, weird offerings, dilutions, Goldmans running the market, a history of fraud, being delisted and one of the largest SEC fines.  So many red flags 

I’m more on the tech side but there’s so many alarms about this stock and the offering by Goldmans. Plus think of SMCI selling metal enclosures to house GPUs and CPUs.  We had many SMCI boxes that are 5+ years old.  Yes we’d upgrade the GPU/CPU every few years but the metal enclosure servers that were SMCI we rarely ever upgrade beyond 5+ years.

SMCI just delivered very disappointing Q4 results as gross margin (11.2% v 15.5%) and EPS (6.25 v 8.1) fell short of the lower bound of their previous update. The problem with FCF has also become severe.

Although their revenue guidance is still optimistic, **I no longer buy their EPS prediction**. Therefore, I need to acknowledge that my prior understanding of this company is wrong.

**I now downgrade my rating of this stock, from overweight to underweight. The price target is adjusted from 1050 to 600.**

**The earnings, on the other side, confirm that NVDA has a very strong quarter.**

**Original Post:**

AI frenzy is unfinished, yet the broader market suffered from a significant retreat this week. The PHLX Semiconductor Index dipped 6.86% on Wednesday, the worst performance since the pandemic. NVDA barely holds the 118 level, while other stocks such as MU, QCOM, AMAT, LRCX, ASML, etc., have dipped below key price levels. They are seeking support on MA120 (or at an even lower price).

I am paying attention to **SMCI**, a stock that may be less focused these days. SMCI lost more than 12% this week and closed at a price below 800. However, this dip has offered unique opportunities, reducing its post-earning risks, and making the price very attractive. Here is my analysis.

0. My Position:

**18 SMCI 01/17/2025 1200 C, 6 bought this Wednesday and Thursday at an average price of 71.6. My average cost is now 110. Although I have suffered a loss of 35%, I am sure that this is just temporary.**

1. Valuation:

**SMCI is trading at a PE TTM of 44.63 and a 1-yr forward PE of 22.17**. This is a very attractive price given its growth this year and the year to come. As a comparison, DELL is trading at a 1-yr forward PE of 16.17, with its growth much slower than that of SMCI.

SMCI is offering the market its unique stack-scale liquid-cooling system that can customized. With the surging demand for liquid cooling for AI server applications (especially the application of the NVDA B series), I expect SMCI to expand its portion in the AI server market while maintaining its current gross margin. The fundamentals of the corp are solid and I see great visibility in its future performance.

2. Technical:

SMCI is trading at a support level of 760-805 which is ultrastrong, which marks the dividing line between the bullish and bearish momentum. We can see that this level has been tested multiple times in the past 2 months, while strong buying has supported the stock in this range. All MAs (up to MA120) have converged, indicating the bottom consolidation to come to an end.

Besides, **the current price is only 7% higher than the closing price of the previous earnings call, while its peers in the semiconductor industry have surged by more than 20% (e.g., 25% for NVDA).** This indicates that the market may have digested the possible scenario of the stock failing to deliver results that are good enough. This risk-off emotion will help relieve some post-earning risks.

3. The broader semiconductor industry:

ASML delivered very good Q2 results, with a <2% miss on its revenue guidance for Q3. TSM just delivered a blockbusting earnings report that beat the top and bottom lines on both quarterly performance and guidance. This indicates that chipmakers such as NVDA are having a very good season with demands surging even more than before. **This indicates that SMCI is also having a very great season where I expect its revenue and EPS to beat its bar which has far exceeded the market consensus**.

4. Rating:

**I now initiate an 'Outperform' rating for SMCI. The 12-month price target is set to be 1050, which indicates a potential upside of about 35%.**

The expected forward valuation is about 30, somewhat larger than its peers simply because of its growth.",0.5333333333333333,2024-07-20,12
My next play: Bullish on HPE earnings,570,1d44ra1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1d44ra1/my_next_play_bullish_on_hpe_earnings/,814,2024-05-30 19:31:17,"HPE is definitely the red headed step-child in the server market. However, at this point its valuation is becoming attractive.

My bullish case is:

1. They haven’t really participated in this AI rally yet like SMCI or DELL.
2. I think they finally are getting their shit together and actually bringing compelling (or at least viable) products to market. At least all of their marketing messaging seems to be all in on AI.
3. Shares and calls are cheap.
4. If Dell does well on earnings, I think HPE will also get a lift. You can play it more risky by getting in today, or safer by getting in after Dell ER.

So, I’m just hoping for the “me too” effect here next ER mostly.

We need to speak up and meet in person at the SMCI headquarters and have a talk with Charles. Basically he needs to fix this. The earnings call could have gone a lot better if he just fudged the numbers a little bit. Why did he have to be so literal and kill the vibe. 

Sometimes the truth is not the best course of action…sometimes a CEO needs to be creative and say the business isn’t f’d from competition by other companies. To hell with HPE and Dell. Outside of them offering more services like cloud backup and customer support, they can’t even hold a candle to SMCI which once traded at $1200 without any IP or moat whatsoever. 

Charles needs us and our opinions. Maybe if we explain to him nicely that the stock needs to be at 1200 so many of us can break even, he will understand our plight. 

My suggestion is that he puts out a video and retracts some of his previous statements about margin  pressure. Just say “oh I totally messed up these numbers. We actually are at 14% profit not 11%. Doug the assistant made a typo when handing me the GAAP numbers. Not to worry we laid him off. So that frees up another 80k for CAPEX from Doug’s salary.” Or something along those lines. Maybe he can get all his work buddies together as well and buy some company stock to boost it from the inside. 

Anyone have any other suggestions? 

Also, Iif anyone knows Nancy Pelosi or has a way to get a hold of her maybe we can explain our situation in hopes she buys some options or shares in SMCI. That will get it to 1200 in a weeks time. ",0.0,2024-08-09,5

* There is a race to capture AI offerings between Google, Microsoft, Amazon, OpenAI, and other upstarts. Neither can give up that race, even if it means more infra spending. For example, Google's stock fell 20% over a small bug in their AI offering. 
* The LLM model sizes are increasing multifold, requiring more/better GPUs, which means more business for NVIDIA. The previous models are mostly useless.
* Assemblers like SMCI have projected a doubling of sales in their recent earning, even with lower margins. 
* Nvidia keeps an insane margin and keeps raising it. Their ability to tell a story around the lower cost to operate, including net energy and compute has been bought by the market. Huangs says it is cheaper to run AI operations with a million-dollar Nvidia chip than a free chip from a competitor. 
* There is still no competition to either Nvidia chips or the Cuda programming and libraries that almost everyone uses for GPU ops. Nvidia has a 10-year lead on GPU programming and open libraries.
* **A reversal of this trend would have telltale signs. None exist.**

Are $SMCI Problems $NVDA Gains?,0,1f3fqzk,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1f3fqzk/are_smci_problems_nvda_gains/,13,2024-08-28 22:44:52,"The collapse of $SMCI is causing some (like Sylvia Jablonski from Defiance ETF's) to say they're buying the dip, while others consider it catastrophic for the company given the ""accounting manipulation"" claim from Hindenburg Research. Their market cap is paltry compared to Nvidia, the company which the world is waiting on right now. $NVDA is down a little bit right now which happens from time to time, and their earnings will probably look stellar, I'm sure.

Are people starting to question whether Jensen's team are playing the same kinds of games? Both companies have seen meteoric growth over the last few years as the very mention of AI causes stocks to moon with virtually no other business case. At the end of the day, it's unlikely this is the end of the rainbow (sorry to the bears) but it does call into question whether the market will temporarily halt excitement on semiconductor stocks in general (the leader of course being Nvidia) or if it is just an isolated incident.

Either people are pulling out of $SMCI like it's the end because it is, or maybe everybody is just rushing in to capitalize on the continued rise of Nvidia. The question is really about whether the entire sector is wrought with fraud, and if so, will that actually impact anything broadly, or if it's just this one company that's getting punished for it now. Either way, the Magnificent 7 are blinking red right now, and it might spill into other things.",0.0,2024-08-28,3

Yesterday i had made a post on this subreddit about how SMCI is an undervalued stock, and that it is heavily involved in the future of AI, due to them supplying server systems to big companies such as AMD and Nvidia. 
I had also stated that the stock is undervalued, however, even though the stock had skyrocketed 12.5% today, i still strongly believe that the stock is still undervalued at $875 as it hit $960 a month ago and $1229 around march.

The company also had stated that they want to supply 1000 liquid cooling racks per month, and increase their 1% market share to 15% within the next 12 months. This means that the stock has a lot of room for growth and i firmly believe that it can reach a market cap of $75 billion after its next ER, which would make the share price at around $1300.

I am currently holding 10 shares right now, which is down from my 20 shares from yesterday as i had sold at $880. However, if it dips, i may buy more shares, but if it continues to rally, then i may hold onto the 10 shares i have as of right now.",0.0,2024-06-14,2

I have only around 5k USD left, I have been unemployed since 5 months due to tech market and I dont have any choice left, either I go all in at this point or disappear quietly.

Here is my plan, according to the research I have done, for this ""bubble"" to peak, we need to see %3000 or similar growth in a short time in many stocks, looking at what happened during dot-com.

Some of the research you can see in this video, there is data on dot-com to compare: Write this to youtube to watch the video (""E7: NVIDIA AI BUBBLE - We Can't Stay Quiet Any Longer""). I didnt want to post the link

My targets:  
NVDA to 2500 or above. (I would even say 4000 for this one but I am taking it softer)

SMCI to 4000 or around.

AMD to 2000 or above  (this is the real deal because I think AMD will ramp up competition against NVDA. This would make AMD around 3 Trillion company)

AVGO to 2000 or above

SMH to 500 or above

AMAT to 500 or around.

TSM to 300 or above

Coming days I will be posting my positions. Wish me good luck. I will start adding more after CPI data on March 12 because I am expecting CPI to come hotter therefore it might give a good opportunity to enter into some of these stocks

Your thoughts?

EDIT 1: Since I promised to post some positions, I will post some. Now I have 3 calls on TSMC. 25 CFD contracts on NVDA, and 20 on AMD. Once they go up a bit, I am planning to transition all positions into call options, cuz you know what? Fuck CFDs. I have a romantic relationship with AMD that I cannot explain, I am planning to go big on that one. TSMC 200 C expires on 28 March.

It’s got good projected earnings growth for this year which enables it to easier ustify elevated valuations when you consider these compound over next couple years and crucially makes it hard to short. 
And joining the sp500 is gonna be a huge spike and everyone knows it. 
Sp500 market cap 42 trillion. At the current valuation SMC is gonna be 0.1% of that, so 42 billion. 21-25% of the sp500 is owned by passive index funds that will be forced by buy this stock on mar 18. That’s approximately 10 billion of stock coming solely from the buy side. That’s absolutely huge. At approx 1000 dollars share price that’s 10 million stocks purchased. Average daily volume is 9 million shares. 
As a professional trader, I’d most likely spread this out over the 10 days if I had this order to execute. A 10% bump on trading volume coming solely from one direction has the potential to have a huge impact on price if the volume isn’t there on the sell side. 
If the volume is there, we’ll most likely get a stalemate as people profit take into the spike, but can’t imagine anyone sophisticated enough to have 10 billion to sell that wouldn’t be aware of the forced buying pressure over the coming days and so one would think the sellers be much less aggressive chasing price.
In summary, less likely price gets crushed, could definitely see it rocketing on low sell side liquidity in a backdrop of AI-mania. ",0.0,2024-03-02,2

The next day of making that post, SMCI had reached $876 on the close.

This means that SMCI was up well over 8% today and up by 16% in the past week.

(SMCI) announced its third-quarter and next year's outlook after the market closed. The 2025 revenue is expected to exceed the market expectation of $23.6 billion, with the company estimating annual revenue to be between $26 billion and $30 billion. Additionally, they announced a 10-for-1 stock split in October, both considered positive news.

🚨 However, the second-quarter financial report is not looking good. Although the revenue of $5.31 billion slightly exceeded the market expectation of $5.3 billion, the adjusted EPS was only $6.25, far below the market expectation of $8.07.

In simple terms, the financial report and forecast have mixed results, causing the stock price to experience extreme volatility in after-hours trading. Initially, it surged by more than 20%, but then selling pressure quickly emerged, causing a vertical drop. Currently, it has fallen by more than 11%, showing dramatic fluctuations that truly live up to its reputation as a volatile stock 📉.

I believe this is mainly because the market is still focused on whether the AI theme can achieve actual returns. After the valuation is highly inflated, profits must be significantly better than the market expects.

👉 The issue with Super Micro Computer is not just that the EPS is below expectations, but the gap with the market expectation of $8.07 is very large. This discrepancy is the largest in the past five years for any quarter. This high discrepancy occurred because investors were overly optimistic about the growth of AI servers, resulting in such a large deviation in actual profits. This perfectly illustrates the saying ""ideals are very full, but reality is very skinny.""

Additionally, the second-quarter gross profit margin quickly dropped to only 11.2%, down 5.8% from the same period last year, and more than 4% lower than the 15.5% in the first quarter, hitting a new low since May 2007. A continuous decline in gross profit margin is definitely not a good sign; just look at Tesla. Although Super Micro Computer's revenue continues to grow and slightly exceeds expectations, the gross profit margin is rapidly declining. Selling more but earning less will make the market worry that this industry might be getting too competitive.

Hello regards, after the crazy market session with SMCI loosing the $1k level , and with NVDIA ER coming to play next week, I saw lots of posts with probable moves on PLTR, TSM, SMCI and others.

Since IV is quit high for options play in SMCI and NVDIA, if the prices tanked we will not see Put or Call gains. However some regards sugested to go with QQQ, trying to capture the NVDIA movement, I did some charts and from my regardness ( I cant read candles, only YOLO charts), my points are summarized bellow:

1. TSLA:  There is a likelihood that TSLA can be rebound if the market start to sell-of NVDIA after the ER. The chart shows migration from TSLA to NVDIA in January.

2. QQQ : seems does not capture the moves of NVDIA, by the chart presented.

3. PLTR: keep the same NVDIA moviment, if one goes down the other goes too...

4.TSM: looks like after Feb/07 investors also have migrate to NVDIA. But TSM also can follow the NVDIA's patterns post ER.

5. SMCI: this crazy rocket since Jan/17 has it own move ...and the NVDIA results or moves can affect only by fear of wich were happened to SMCI (my gues, I am not an expert).

Any thoughts? Something that I missed or my ape brain could not figure out ?

Disclaymer : I have positions in MSFT and AAPL - calls and both are red :(), Put on COIN and Put on CSCO.

SMCI 1 week later,23,1dkev19,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1dkev19/smci_1_week_later/,11,2024-06-20 21:15:42,"Last week on wednesday i made a post about SMCI and how it is undervalued at around $775 to $800 a share. Today it just crossed over $1000 and reached around $1014 per share which is almost a 30% gain within 1 week. This is due to elon musk making an announcement that Dell and SMCI would be building a supercomputer with xAI. Personally im no fan of Elon Musk, but this is good news for SMCI as it will provide the company greater revenue and profit, which will help their EPS grow much more quicker and make the company more valuable. Currently the company has a PE ratio of around 54 and has a market cap of around $55 to $60 billion. This means that if the company continues to grow at its current growth rate, it could potentionally be worth around $150 to $200 billion within 1 year.

Currently own 4 shares of SMCI and may buy more if it dips below $850.",0.0,2024-06-20,5

It seems the stock moved similarly 2 Fridays in a row, but I’m jumping onto this meme stonk pretty late so idk.

There are talks of stock dilution because the company is trying to raise 1.5 billion by selling convertible senior notes based on $975 price per share, which will raise money for them but apparently also dilute existing shares, I don’t understand how this works cause I’m regarded but it sounds like using inflation of the shares to raise money from actual big dog investors.

So what’s the play? Puts or calls? It seems like both are the answer but the question is timing. Probably SMCI will keep rocketing up but will dip in the long run, try not to get burned, but we all know 99% of regards need to burn so that 1% that time it right will be rewarded.

I was thinking about buying calls before market close today but decided not to because of theta over the weekend. Maybe the best play is to buy calls if it tanks at market open on Monday 02/26 or puts if it pumps at market open.",0.0,2024-02-24,3

The kind where the only thing standing between me and existential dread was a cup of overpriced coffee. Little did I know, fate had brewed up something special for me at the local Starbucks.

As I stood in line, and ordered caramel macchiato—I bumped into none other than the CEO of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Antonio. Yes, the big cheese of HPE themselves.

After a moment of awkward eye contact, the CEO, recognizing an opportunity to make a fan for life or just eager to get me to stop  gaping, offered to buy my drink. ""One caramel macchiato for my new  friend here,"" they announced, as they walked up to Apple Pay.

As I went up to thank him, he said ""No Need, but here's a secret: HPE is going to moon.""

So, fellow investors, next time you find yourself in line for a caramel macchiato, keep your eyes peeled. You never know when the CEO of a tech giant might just buy you a drink and inadvertently reveal the future of the stock market.

After YOLOing into EFUT and making $32k+ yesterday, here's my new insights:

Top competitors to SCMI in the server rack businesses are:

1. Dell
2. HPE.

You already know what happened to Dell during their earnings call. HPE's next earnings is in 2 months. There's currently a dip. After getting my coffee, ended up buying. Play: 2025 $20 calls.

Here's an angle I haven't really seen discussed yet:

Currently, SMCI is a stock in the Russell 2000. With it's meteoric rise and profitable quarters, this could change.

For S&P500 (SPY) inclusion there are two very important requirements (among others):

>  A company must have a market cap above $12.7 billion.

>  A company must have positive earnings in the most recent quarter and year.

The two stocks that are potential candidates for inclusion are SMCI and ELF according to this article:

> Super Micro reported $640 million in net income in Fiscal 2023 and continues to deliver profitable quarters. Supermicro also fulfills the market cap requirement with a healthy margin of safety.

Like with TSLA back when that was cool and doing regarded +10% moves, SPY inclusion means all those passive funds are forced to buy into stock already going parabolic.

This could basically be smart money buying now to sell the bag to dumb passive money later. The catalyst was the last ER that made the inclusion more likely and some hedge funds figured this shit out. Look at the chart, that's when the parabolic run started and volume ramped up.

But there's also these two requirements for inclusion:

> Its shares must be highly liquid.

> At least 50% of its outstanding shares must be available for public trading.

Is SMCI fulfilling those?",0.0,2024-02-16,5
SMCI forecasting predictability (10 mio for a 2026! sold call),4,1aevihk,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1aevihk/smci_forecasting_predictability_10_mio_for_a_2026/,14,2024-01-31 00:01:04,"I have no words; January 2024 just started. This is a sold 2026 500 call, 2 years from now. I had no clue what I did 2 years ago, let alone 1 year ago. I wouldn't even know what I would do 7 weeks from now. Predictability (i'm a former 20yr banker in HF/banks) reduces over time. I've not seen something this big and that far ahead (decay) in my lifetime (20 years tenure). I am speechless.

When SMCI goes up by $250 and even a blind ape would have made money.,27,1axk1yp,https://i.redd.it/2cfr5z9js7kc1.jpeg,8,2024-02-23 04:08:57,"So I managed to make a slight loss even in the craziest bull run in recent history.

As per my last post, I started buying puts at open as SMCI reached $850 before open. I YOLOed into about 18 of those 700p hoping for any dip that might have brought the stock down, of course the dip never came.

While I was waiting for the dip I decided that I would make some $$ buying some close to itm calls for small gains which well didn’t work so well either as u can see from the 880 and 900c.

After much internal debate I took the loss on the 700p when SMCI reached about $910 and I watched it go to $940 not believing what I am seeing. A $200 rally, I thought no way this is real at which point I asked my wife who has zero actual investing experience and was actually sound asleep on what I should do and she said it will keep going up, to $1000 and that I have paper hands (calls would have printed if I held).

I lost it and bought a 950c when the stock was at $940 and doubled down with a 970c when the stock reached $965. Managed to get out at $980/985. But still a loss overall.

TL:DR Fuck any analysis, thesis, this thing just prints money if you hold and buy calls. Unless ofc theres another dump.

Not financial advice!

Like a time when getting them is going to become... prohibitively expensive.

What do you think? Is this total tinfoil or is the market reacting to more than whispers this time? Other than pure greedy speculation on AI (which I admit could simply be what is happening) what else could explain what we're seeing happen here??

# May 9-10th: the boring drop

Due to ARM's shite guidance, NVDA as well as the rest of the semi-conductors are going to have a cool day tomorrow barring a sizeable increase in jobless claims (more jobless claims = economy doing crap, thus the Fed is more likely to cut interest rates, which Wall Street glazes themselves over). The reason? BS articles like this are being spread by the news that misattributes ARM's increase in pricing to the AI boom (of which it has no relation):

[https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/tsmc-morgan-stanley-hikes-pt-on-arm-ai-cpu-boost-3426842](https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/tsmc-morgan-stanley-hikes-pt-on-arm-ai-cpu-boost-3426842)

Normies eat this shit up and if SPY ain't peaking in the morning we're going to see a decrease or flat market at best bleeding into Friday. 

Call/Put skew further shows that traders are consolidating at $900 into the pre-pre-earnings week:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3wfjhk9dbazc1.png?width=1444&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4fa3ea1fa1878a5ee298e5b16d03b5a6a80a9d1

[https://marketchameleon.com/Overview/NVDA/VolatilitySkew/](https://marketchameleon.com/Overview/NVDA/VolatilitySkew/)

The gist of this is that if we have really good news, NVDA could hit $920 but with poor market news could hit a bottom of $875 by this Friday.

With VIX (a measure of market volatility, which measures fear) being below 16 and hovering around 13, Market Makers are likely to feed into trends and buy dips so this is bullish in the market overall.

# May 13-17th: the slight recovery then deep decline

Heading into next week we are likely to see a recovery in price from the dip this week followed by a decline preceding earnings the following week. Why? Hedging. Wall Street as well as some retail investors are aware that the previous guidances issues were made under completely different macroeconomic expectations. 

Previously we were under the assumption that 3 rate cuts were coming whilst now only 1 possibly? The result is a drop in price akin to the previous earnings cycle but worse, given the poor earnings we've seen from fellow semiconductor manufacturers. 

The previous earnings cycle was actually positive across the board and what did we see?

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/u3j7wvaqdazc1.png?width=717&format=png&auto=webp&s=01f638b22d3b0eb198b7d9237993892b15121bd0

Roughly a $75 decline in share price during the week preceding earnings. And this was off of good news in the market. We could see the price hit sub-800 if everyone cashes out all at once in this week, if previous market behavior is anything to go off of.

Depending on CPI on Wednesday and Jobless Claims on Thursday this could be mediated but we shall see. The likely range is 845-895 based on previous volatility around earnings.

# May 20-22nd: Earnings END-GAME

Nvidia will most likely continue it's drop from the previous week but this isn't a problem for us. Why? Because we know NVDA is the shit. I mean it truly is in another league of it's own. It quite literally is the industry standard that only those on the know are aware of. Their platform is what pretty much everyone who trains AI is using and will continue to use due to how optimized it is.

We're talking about the comparison of an iPhone in 2008 to a flimsy flip phone. It's just so much more advanced that they are crushing the competition. This is why regardless of AMD, INTC, SMCI, all of their failures, NVDA will absolutely crush EPS, Revenue, and Guidance. 

[https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/what-is-nvidia-what-do-they-make-ai-artificial-intelligence-rcna140171](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/what-is-nvidia-what-do-they-make-ai-artificial-intelligence-rcna140171)

They are the backbone of all AI training models right now and as it stands, no one is even close to touching them. Thus they will destroy expectations and rebound to even higher highs than Wall Street has expectations for due to their monopoly-like control of the industry. Barring a world war or FTC intervention, there is no way this stock can go down.
