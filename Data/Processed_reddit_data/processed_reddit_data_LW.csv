$LW Buy the -20% dip with your French fries,73,1bvpxq9,https://i.redd.it/dfapgg21dhsc1.jpeg,44,2024-04-04 20:52:55,"
LW missed earnings by a boatload as a surprise, blaming a transition to a new ERP system. 

“The transition to a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system in North America negatively impacted our financial results in the quarter by more than we expected,” said Tom Werner, President and CEO. “The ERP transition temporarily reduced the visibility of finished goods inventories located at distribution centers, which affected our ability to fill customer orders. In turn, this pressured sales volume and margin performance. While we are disappointed with the magnitude of the ERP transition’s effect on the quarter, after implementing systems adjustments and modifying processes, we believe the impact is behind us as our order fulfillment rates have normalized.”

The CEO says order fulfillment rates have been normalized.

	•	Short-term operational disruptions and financial impact are notable.

*Risks:*
	•	Immediate financial and operational risks due to the ERP system transition.
	•	Client dependency could pose strategic risks.

*Outlook:*
	•	Despite short-term challenges, particularly with the ERP system, long-term prospects remain strong.

	•	Adjusted EBITDA(2) of $1,480 million to $1,510 million, which includes a temporary, higher-than-expected impact from the transition to a new ERP system in North America and a $96 million pre-tax charge(1) for the write-off of excess raw potatoes
	•	Adjusted Net Income(2) of $800 million to $820 million and Adjusted Diluted EPS(2) of $5.50 to $5.65”

https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240404698637/en/Lamb-Weston-Reports-Fiscal-Third-Quarter-2024-Results-Updates-Fiscal-Year-2024-Outlook

While the outlook acknowledges impacts from the ERP system transition and a one-time charge for raw potatoes, the overall financial projections remain robust. These factors suggest a stable operational base with the potential for recovery and growth, marking a cautiously optimistic view for the company’s fiscal health in 2024.

Given the current financials and market position, LW appears to be in a temporary bearish phase due to the ERP transition but holds bullish potential for the long term.


I dont have financial advice but buying stock at the dip and holding long or buying leaps the safer bet to me, but we’re on wsb bay bay. Also I’m a regard and bought too early in the dip. I probably should have waited until things calm down a bit. But I’m gonna hold regardless. GLHF

For the first seven months of fiscal year 2024, which began last October, net interest payments totaled $514 billion, outpacing defense by $20 billion.

Your favorite habit likely lead to the decline of sales in your local **Clown Burger** joint.

  
  On Tuesday, [$LW](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/LW) Lamb Weston's(MCD Potato supplier) released their earnings and it showed a %9.25 loss of sales with around %27.62 loss of profit (EBITDA). They somehow blamed AI for that miss??? They used a new software that helps in managing and connecting all parts of their business, like sales, supply chain, finance, and HR, in one place and they blame it for the decline. Afterwards, the stock dropped %25 on Wednesday. 

  McDonald's accounts for approximately %14 of Lamb Weston's total sales. The profit margin of fries for MCD is between 70 and 80 percent. Moreover, fries make up at least 20 percent of the food menu item orders. The combined sales of Big Macs, Chicken McNuggets, and French fries make up about 60% of McDonald's total business.

 Another red flag, was them announcing a week ago that they're getting back the $5 meal deals. The need for reintroducing it signals sensitivity to a downturn, and that crayon eaters(like myself) cut back on spending. In other words, they wouldn't have to eroded profit margins significantly, if adequate people were coming through the door.

 Finally, while looking through Mcdonald's search impressions in the upcoming reported period, they were below their 5 year average by a mile. Also not to mention the boycott campaigns.

I’m *clearly* just a gay bear autist passing on what I heard from some geeks

[chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/lwHD9H5i/)

Resistance points
1. We just barely broke through a strong trendline (brr power bull trap?) into a phat double top 

2. Now we’re about to hit the .382 [Fibonacci retracement point](https://youtu.be/Kz6-8nQLRHM)  (Not easy to break through)

3. We’re also about to hit the 20 day moving average and the death cross

Volume

Volume has been significantly lower for the past 3 days. Bulls running out of steam?

So all the technical analysis geeks are saying we’re at a clear tipping point.. there’s a shit ton of people with sell triggers around 265 and if we reject it we should drop like a mother fucker. If we somehow brrr through we might moon.

Fundamentals:

Bears: Virus getting exponentially worse, unemployment, shrunken gdp, etc. Economic impact will be worse than what we thought.

Bulls: Virus is a temporary problem/hoax and we overreacted, pricing in too much damage. The economy is still strong.

If you’re holding puts, don’t give up yet. Maybe hedge or rollout. 

If you’re holding calls, be careful. A lot of indicators say we’re at the top, but if we somehow retard strength our way through you can get rich asf.

TLDR: We’re about 1% away from what could be a  bloodbath.

Lamb Weston Earnings Play,23,1ft0d9b,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ft0d9b/lamb_weston_earnings_play/,37,2024-09-30 22:20:58,"So $LW - Lamb Weston was scheduled to release Q1 earnings tomorrow morning, but now it looks like it may be delayed by a day.

I'm just going to go out on a limb and say it is likely a third quarter of shitty results in a row. To begin with, never a good sign if the call gets delayed.

But the real reasons are much more tangible. Lamb Weston Meijer, their huge European venture was for a very, very long time a 50/50 joint venture so their activity never flowed into results, so when they had a bad year it didn't really matter. They bought it out a couple years ago now. This is relevant because in Europe a very significant amount of the processing potatoes are not contracted, farmers sell them open in the market...and this summer prices were near record highs all season. This means their COGS in Europe are likely super high. There have been shortages of potatoes in Europe and a lot of the crop has had issues driving the price up. In addition it sounds like seed potatoes aren't great meaning they likely have to forecast higher costs for those.

In the US, most of their business is contracted for 1-2 years. So they lost a lot of business when they fucked up their ERP, and it is unlikely they would have gained much of any of that back by now. They had to pick up other business through heavy discounting, and I would expect that to continue. Especially since this has been dubbed the ""summer of value"" for all the big quick serve restaurants, and regular restaurant traffic has declined per recent results.

They had some kind of epic fuck up with McDonald's Korea, which drove the chain to stop selling fries in the entire country for like 2 weeks. They disclosed this event in the last earnings call, but it is possible as  the fallout continues there will be additional costs, because it had to be very serious.

Their retail division seems to have given up. It was one of their biggest drivers of growth through covid. Now, they have increased competition and aren't doing anything. Simplot effectively bought Ore-Ida and has revitalized that brand, and McCain (the largest fry producer) has entered into many retail spaces in the US, both of these companies have been discounting to gain market share. Lamb launched their Grown in Idaho brand like 5 years ago to be a middle tier product, now with others discounting, it is one of the most expensive. They also seem to have lost lots of freezer space.

Their ERP upgrade is still likely going on and draining more money. This may end up being just about the most money any company has ever shelled out for one when you look at cost to market Cap.

They have a plant in South America, which has also seen a potato crisis, much worse than Europe. So that facility is probably bleeding money. They were also building out a new huge facility expansion, but to put it in perspective their most recent China plant got delayed well beyond their initial schedule, how the hell do you think it is going to go in Argentina. I'd expect that will be delayed quite a bit because nothing happens fast there, period. Delayed = more expensive. And honestly no idea what kind of moron thinks buying a business in Argentina, which is in competition for the worst economy of the century in the world, is a great deal...and then to double down. CEO must have had some bad advice.

At this point one of the biggest hindrances appears to be the C-Suite. It looks like the CEO has never had to manage failure, and is hapless and unable to course correct...because this is a long time now and there has been no real plans it seems apart from hoping things get better.

Definitely getting puts, not as much as I have previously. But will look to see how things sit at the end of the day. It is possible they pull out a win because they have proved their ability to forecast is dog shit.

TLDR
French fries good, bad management equals puts

$NRDY DD 🤓,164,166duus,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/166duus/nrdy_dd/,66,2023-08-31 20:42:55,"Hello it’s me your degen Sherpa for today, here to pollute your mind with dreams of a 10x baggers, excess, and extacy 💊. As your humble Sherpa in true fashion I have purchased x600 calls expiring in December of the stonk I’m about to nerd out about.

First look at how happy this fucker looks:

https://preview.redd.it/janw30ubpglb1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=56262993c8acdf6fe673a5e3916ec690fff75512

&#x200B;

Anyway, about $NRDY. The company operates an online platform for live learning. The company's purpose-built proprietary platform leverages technology, including AI to connect students, users, parents, guardians, and purchasers of various ages to tutors, instructors, subject matter experts, educators, and other professionals, delivering value on both sides of the network. I originally came across looking for AI stocks to “invest” in. The company's vision is to leverage AI to enhance live instruction and human interaction, and early in the [ year as required they released some buzzy AI products](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230203005313/en/Nerdy-Announces-New-AI-Enabled-Products-Including-an-AI-Generated-Lesson-Plan-Creator-and-AI-Enabled-Chat-Tutoring).  Nerdy’s CEO, Chucky Coon (whoops Chuck Co hn), also bought about $30 million of stock over the last year. Let’s put the CEO buying into perspective; he now owns ⅓ of $NRDY shares, a figure that is [rare amongst public companies](https://www.bizjournals.com/stlouis/news/2023/01/18/nerdy-ownership-stake.html)….

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sx1vsalrpglb1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=830a05015cc4ecb02873d51bbdcb94f4a1b491f1

So what this graph shows is that he bought when $NRDY was around $2, current price is $4.72 so a 100%+ gain should probably exist NOW. Nope, recent filings show that he has been buying up until last week. It wasn’t a huge buy but good to see - [16455 shares at average price $4.57/share, reported on 08/25/2023](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1819404/000162828023030464/xslF345X05/wk-form4_1692878031.xml). Price is around 3% higher than when Chucky last bought. That’s not all. That was actually the 3rd buy of the last week. First he bought 17,090 shares on 8/23 at $4.39, then 16,502 shares at $4.55 on 8/24.

If you read the article [linked, Chuck](https://www.bizjournals.com/stlouis/news/2023/01/18/nerdy-ownership-stake.html) also tied his personal compensation almost entirely to the stock price. So the confidence is high by this man. This is where my DD stops they have solid earnings/growth, insider buying last week, and CEO motivated by the one thing I care about  (aka Nerdy running).

Anyway, if you continue  the read you’ll notice that his purchases come as Nerdy reaches a critical moment in its brief history as it shifts to a new revenue model that Chuck believes will lead by the end of this year to profitability.

https://preview.redd.it/jyw9ro4fpglb1.png?width=1162&format=png&auto=webp&s=e71daf64e91e121b61928350941516747d0e1bbf

Can see that his optimism from a year ago has truth to it. However not everyone is happy…

https://preview.redd.it/1080dnbepglb1.png?width=1210&format=png&auto=webp&s=578985c0e1d9341d4989686d7a78e46f439270ce

Ignore Pam, her kids (Marge, Bartholomew, Gertrude, and Gertrudis) hate her.

Anyway, The price action has actually been stable since $NRDY beat earnings and for some reason dumped (almost recovered now). Also, the warrants caught a decent bid last week and ATM IV is almost at 52 week lows.

I’m actually too lazy to do the float calculation but I’ve been watching it for weeks. It moves like a low floater, and its recent moves are surprisingly **not** fueled by options.

Interesting enough $NRDY is  also a back-to-school/covid play which will resume this upcoming month. Can see it via this [recent headline](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jersey-department-education-selects-varsity-110000489.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9maW52aXouY29tLw&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAAlRJg0VWxPhSFpKtk-mJvFvHOqKXsm6A2ZUomjUG0sV4SONxQks8BEBPiEwsJTArJQ26M_zPAZW-DVJvjny_nyEyBTy490lN-Y7r5SCh0KIUpQUiFWlkhr7qS-XXh8SeQrhquwBgsm6LiT8pMWlLhvcbfgo72dmKMzI25AiI9UK) from last week where NJ Dept of Edu selected Nerdy’s platform for some tutoring program tailored to assist students disproportionately affected by the pandemic. Anyway, getting tired, I’ll have my friend and therapist ChatGpt give its thoughts on Nerdy’s latest financials:

Beep Boop,  I ChatGPT have an amazing opportunity as your one, and only, AI Sherpa! Come view the wonderful qualities of the stonk, as I walk you through this low quality to very low quality of due diligence (DD) report for the social media platform Reddit Inc., that I ChatGPT have prepared:

Alright degens, strap in! I've crunched the numbers on NERDY Inc. and here's the skinny:

To the Moon with Revenue: 💹 NERDY's pulling in more coin! Q2 saw a 15.8% jump from last year, and first half ain't bad either with a 10% rise. They printing money!

Gross Profit Vibes: 📈 Their money-making game's got tighter. Gross profit margin for Q2 2023 is a juicy 69.8% (nice), up from 68.1% in Q2 2022.

Operating Loss – Diamond Hands: 🙌 Hold up! Still seeing red on the operating front, but way less blood than last year. Losses are down by about 52.6% for Q2 and 48.8% for the 6 months.

Unrealized (Gain) Loss: 🎢 Hold on to your YOLO calls! Big swings here, mainly 'cause of derivatives playing hardball.

Liquidity – Still Wet: 💦 Cash stayed stable; we ain't going thirsty.

Debt Collectors: 💸 NERDY's been collecting. Accounts receivable took a huge \~55.4% dip. Either they’re getting their money faster, or the credit game’s changed.

Less IOUs: 📉 IOU’s (aka total current liabilities) dropped, mainly 'cause of a plunge in deferred revenue.

Stonk Holders' Equity: 📉 Bit of a dip since Dec 2022, matching the red in their earnings.

Cash Flow Flex: 💪 NERDY's core biz is starting to rain cash. From burning money in 2022 to raking it in 2023!

CapEx Check: 💼 Spending's steady. No wild plays here.

Bottom line, fellow apes: NERDY's got challenges, but it's showing some legit promise. But remember, always DYOR (Do Your Own Research) before hopping onto any rocket! 🚀 P.S. Not financial advice, just one ape's opinion.

Among the top 5 is $CLOV andHere is the thing about $CLOV:

**Clover Health** (NASDAQ:**CLOV**) started  trading on the Nasdaq Exchange back in January after completing its merger with special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings (NYSE:IPOC).

Hindenburg Hedge fund had taken a large position against spacs in general [(Google: Hindenburg vs spacs)](https://www.google.com/search?q=hindenburg+hedge+fund+vs+spacs&bih=698&biw=1280&hl=en&ei=xi2bYJL5MdfY-gSE86a4Cw&oq=hindenburg+hedge+fund+vs+spacs&gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAM6BQghEKABOggIIRCgARCLAzoICCEQqwIQiwM6BQghEKsCOggIIRAWEB0QHlC3KFjPNWDINmgBcAB4AIABY4gBpQaSAQE5mAEAoAEBqgEHZ3dzLXdpergBAsABAQ&sclient=gws-wiz&ved=0ahUKEwiS9Pu5_cLwAhVXrJ4KHYS5CbcQ4dUDCA4&uact=5), and thus $CLOV merger with a SPAC had become one of their targets: [Hindenburg CLOV report](https://hindenburgresearch.com/clover/).

Hindenburg has been shorting $CLOV since FEBRUARY 4, 2021, and then a law suit against $CLOV appeared by Robbins LLP (lawyers), and guess who hired them: Hindenburg Hedge Fund [Hindenburg Robbins LLP](https://www.google.com/search?q=hindenburg+robbins+LLP&hl=en&biw=1280&bih=698&ei=bDCbYK36Dt-90PEP5quV8A8&oq=hindenburg+robbins+LLP&gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAM6BwgAEEcQsAM6CggAEJECEEYQ-QE6CwguEMcBEK8BEJECOggILhDHARCjAjoCCAA6BAgAEEM6BQgAEJECOgQILhBDOgIILjoGCAAQFhAeOgUIIRCgAToICCEQoAEQiwM6BQghEKsCOgcIIRAKEKABUMZTWLmtAWCvsAFoBHACeACAAZwBiAHPE5IBBDE2LjmYAQCgAQGqAQdnd3Mtd2l6sAEAyAEIuAECwAEB&sclient=gws-wiz&ved=0ahUKEwit4P78_8LwAhXfHjQIHeZVBf4Q4dUDCA4&uact=5)

Since then they have been bombarding with press releases of $CLOV being under investigation (misleading title as if the FBI or SEC is investigating).

If you read about the lawsuit, it's all about the SPAC merger, because as far as it comes to CLOV, there are no problems. 

The fundamentals are strong with CLOV still growing in the hundreds of millions per quarter (not $500,000 like MVIS) and the technicals show that it can't get any lower.

Hindenburg taking a large stance against spacs, had made them overlook $CLOV  as an actual success, and they are spending a lot of money to try and cover their shorts,

CLOV is the real deal when in comes to a squeeze because it actually has value. If there is no unity behind this, it means that the whole movement stopped with GME and AMC and that is all for stonks (at least for me).

$ARWR will be the next top pharmaceutical company,82,dv83sb,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dv83sb/arwr_will_be_the_next_top_pharmaceutical_company/,103,2019-11-12 15:48:10,"ARWR is a pharmaceutical company that silences genes which create diseases in humans. They are a platform company meaning all their technology can be used for multiple diseases in all tissues including liver, kidney, lungs, and muscles. They currently have over 300 million in cash and two partnerships with top five pharmaceutical companies (Amgen and Johnson and Johnson) showing validation of their platform. Arrowhead's TRIM platform currently has an exceptional safety record - no serious adverse effects reported in any of their 7 trials within their entire TRIM pipeline. Adding to that, long term toxicity studies have been completed. This upcoming year ARWR will have 3 drugs in phase 3 trials, which is the last stage before becoming approved by the FDA.
They also just released great data on their hepatitis B drug which can be seen [here](http://ir.arrowheadpharma.com/static-files/6d7edbe7-c5a2-46c5-9990-a9cdfec854a9). They are one of the fastest growing stocks of 2019 and they’re not stopping here. Many investors are giving this a price target of $60-$100 by the end of 2020.

How to make money:
BUY CALLS
ARWR has shown exceptional growth in consecutive months and they have so many upcoming catalysts to keep them moving. There are so many things upcoming like investor meetings, partnerships, trials data, and even FDA approvals that will help them continue to grow at an unforeseen rate.

AMC Theatres Saw Record Ticket Sales This Weekend,27,vwi2ze,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vwi2ze/amc_theatres_saw_record_ticket_sales_this_weekend/,58,2022-07-11 18:40:19,"[Yahoo News Article](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amc-theatres-busiest-weekend-2022-120000414.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9maW52aXouY29tLw&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAADBzURMO4-YhEIyZd4LCZF9F0WN_zBdVwIEFKWhTsSsBXoK81iDjksXs75tvSmzzzLM7wEbeJqQqbc6rgIsiK71NmYgKUU2qCoGkGhzKi8lh7bm_nwMYWO0VlkXosu04_hezeJaUjU-14xH7oTv1905QovyB7mWH9-hIjmFPAua_)  
So, **Thor** along with several other titles grossed well this weekend in theatres across the world. But AMC specifically did very well over the weekend. **Outperforming it's numbers this time last year by 12%** just on admission sales. I personally bought a big ass popcorn and drink and some chocolate covered almonds, myself. And I'm wondering if that 12% figure from the above linked article includes those expensive damn snacks. If not, then AMC is definitely about to short skweeze. lmao. Anyway, just based on this great news for AMC being pumped all over the internetz this morning. Retail traders may ride on the backs of casual investors who are reading this news and looking for a lighthouse in the Fed storm. I can't say for sure with just sentiment data, obviously. But I will make this bet: AMC isn't going DOWN today. That, I'm very confident of. Whatya think? :)",0.0,2022-07-11,0

Walking around like you think you are geniuses. We’ve all had the feeling, those who have been around long enough also know the feeling of a painful bad trade that makes you wonder what your kidney is worth on the black market. 

This market is a tough market to trade in. We may be getting a relief rally, dead cat bounce or whatever you wanna call it. Next few days may be good for calls but you need to know this stuff can change fast and your short dated options or way out of the money ones can be set on fire pretty fast. 

So look at my flair, I earned it for helping dipshits like you. 

I hope you guys know how to convert your options to spreads when you run out of day trades. How to get more day trades. The cutoff time to trade 0dte on RH. I hope you know how to take profits and not let greed hurt you. And cut your losses. Why it’s better to sell before earnings.  Etc. 

For those of you who are up on your degen account maybe take out your initial investment and a little profit and be able to say you were a winner which most of the people here can’t say. 

I know you guys want get rich quick bets so you can stop being wage slaves but have you seen all the stories of people who had some life changing profits piss it all away here? To be successful over time you need to be disciplined. Stick around long enough to learn what you need to. To stick around means not getting BTFO. It’s ok to not always be in a trade. Be selective.  I bet whole bunch of you don’t even know why your call you bought is worth less now even though the price of the stock is higher.   

I want you to be successful.    I also don’t want completion behind Wendy’s.   I wrote this a year ago but it covers the basics.  You should at least understand this.  Good luck, be smart.

#Trading Update

  * Market update – stocks rebounded throughout Asia (w/the exception of mainland China)
and the major Eurozone indices have a mild bid. US futures are up small. Nothing major
occurred overnight on the eco data/monetary fronts although there were a slew of articles
focusing on taxes and infrastructure spending. Axios says Thy God-Emperor Trump wants to couple the two
together in order to secure some support from Democrats (http://bit.ly/2obRa3v) while
Thy God-Emperor Trump may struggle to get the corporate rate much below 28% according to the NYT
(http://nyti.ms/2npLQJV). Overall the broader macro narrative stayed largely unchanged
over the last 12-18 hours (see below). The big focus on Tues will likely be on Fed speakers
(both Yellen and Fischer will be delivering comments) although Brady’s tax meeting will be
important too.

  * Calendar for Tues 3/28 – the focus will be on the US advanced goods trade balance for Feb
(8:30amET), US wholesale inventories for Feb (8:30amET), US Case-Shiller home prices for
Jan (9amET), US consumer confidence for Mar (10amET), some Fed speakers (including
Yellen at 12:50pmET and Fischer on CNBC at ~1:30pmET), Brady’s House Ways sand Means
Committee meeting (at which taxes will be discussed), Thy God-Emperor Trump’s climate change executive
order, analyst meetings (CY), and earnings (CCL, DRI, INFO, and MKC pre-open and SONC,
VRNT after the close).

  * FX/TSYs – the DXY is stabilizing after slumping ~45bp on Mon (the DXY is up ~10bp so far
Tues morning). The USD is flat vs. the EUR and JPY and is down small against the GBP.
Treasuries are pretty flat.

  * Europe – the major Eurozone indices are up ~25bp. Autos, basic resources, tech, banks,
media, and utilities are outperforming while staples, fin services, real estate, and telecoms
are lagging. Wolseley is one of the top stocks in the SXXP after posting solid earnings.
Credit Suisse said it would make a decision on capital “as soon as possible”. Ericsson was hit
at the open after issuing a restructuring update but the stock has since bounced. Redrow
said it will not make a bid for Bovis. Two of Tesco’s largest shareholders are calling on the
co to drop its bid for Booker. Akzo Nobel said it would provide a strategy update on Apr 19.

  * Asia – most of the major markets rebounded w/the exception of mainland China: Japan
(TPX +1.34%, NKY +1.14%), Hong Kong (Hang Seng +0.63%, HSCEI +0.62%), mainland China
(SHCOMP -0.43%, Shenzhen -0.25%, CSI 300 -0.24%), Taiwan (TAIEX flat), Korea (KOSPI
+0.35%), Australia (ASX 200 +1.3%), and India (up ~50bp for the major indices). There
weren’t any major macro headlines out of Asia. Within the NKY all major sub-groups saw
gains but healthcare, materials, fins, real estate, and utilities were esp. strong. SUMCO
jumped following pos. sell-side comments (the stock jumped 5.3%). Names levered to
SUMCO rallied in sympathy (Micronics, Advantest, Tokyo Electron, etc.). In Hong Kong, top
performers included Lenovo (+4.1%) and some Macau-linked stocks (Sands China +4.02%,
Galaxy +3.52%, etc.). In Taiwan large-cap tech was mixed (TSMC +0.78%, Hon Hai +0.77%
vs. Largan -1.25%, Catcher -1.5%) and fins underperformed. In Korea chemical stocks were
strong (LG Chem, Lotte Chemical, etc.) while Samsung Electronics rose 0.68%.

#US macro update

  * The bigger picture backdrop remains (frustratingly) unchanged. Healthcare was/is a net
negative for the Thy God-Emperor Trump/Ryan agenda but it is by no means fatal and so long as investors
anticipate some action on the tax front the SPX will struggle to experience significant
weakness (investors appear to appreciate that the tax process is in its very early stages and
thus are willing to wait a few more months for details). The nominal growth backdrop
remains supportive and many think the SPX would be capable of posting ~$133-135 in ’18
EPS w/o anything happening in Washington (the mid-point of that range could support the
SPX at ~2250-2300 which means there isn’t an excessive amount of political hope in
stocks). The biggest risk for the time being really isn’t political (the entire market is closely
scrutinizing Washington and near-term political expectations are low) but instead
concerns growth – sentiment around growth has grown quite upbeat (both towards real
growth and inflation) but also very complacent and risks are rising (widening gap between
surveys and hard data, soft Mar US flash PMIs, soft oil prices, etc.). It’s tough to foresee the
growth narrative turning more positive from present levels and any reversal could undercut
the $133-135 ’18 Washington-neutral EPS range. Keep in mind the calendar is pretty
sparse over the next few weeks – aside from some eco data this Fri (US/EU inflation and
China PMIs), the FOMC minutes (Wed 4/5), the Thy God-Emperor Trump/Xi summit (4/6-7), and US Mar jobs
(Fri 4/7), most investors are now looking towards the upcoming CQ1 earnings season (which
starts Thurs morning 4/13).

#Top Headlines for Tuesday

  * Thy God-Emperor Trump wants to do tax reform and infrastructure together according to Axios. Thy God-Emperor Trump feels
“burned” by the House Freedom Caucus and he knows that combining infrastructure into a
tax bill could help win some support from Democrats. Axios. http://bit.ly/2obRa3v

  * Tax overhaul – 1986 vs. 2017. An AP article looks at the differences between now and ’86 –
“tax overhaul efforts lacks advantages Reagan enjoyed in ‘86”. Reagan was popular and
worked w/powerful and experienced leaders in Congress. All the key principals had
established and trusting relationships. The situation facing President Donald Thy God-Emperor Trump
features none of those advantages. AP http://apne.ws/2mLzUoK

  * Thy God-Emperor Trump’s final tax bill, to the extent he can even achieve one, may look very different from
what he promised on the campaign trail. During the campaign Thy God-Emperor Trump talked about a 15%
corporate tax rate. That was subsequently revised to 15-20% and now people in the WH are
talking about >20%. However, Thy God-Emperor Trump’s final corporate tax rate may be as high as 28% if he
wants his plan to be revenue-neutral. Note that 28% was the same rate proposed by
Obama in ’12-’16. Most on Wall St are assuming a rate of no higher than 25%. NYT
http://nyti.ms/2npLQJV

  * Healthcare – despite the failure of ACHA, Thy God-Emperor Trump and the GOP face a big decision that
could severely undermine the public insurance exchanges. House Republicans filed a
lawsuit in 2014 to block subsides paid to insurers participating in the ACA exchanges but the
case was delayed as Ryan pursued repeal/replace. Thy God-Emperor Trump and Ryan could ask for the
lawsuit to continue as soon as May. Without these subsidies the few insurers still
participating in the exchanges would either exit the market completely or significantly raise
premiums. Even the threat of losing the premiums could have a dramatic effect. Insurers
must decide by June whether to participate in the exchanges next year. WSJ.
http://on.wsj.com/2ntDHpy

  * Schumer and McConnell headed for an “epic” clash over the Supreme Court and
government funding. Schumer is “itching for a fight” and the upcoming Gorsuch
confirmation and Apr 28 funding expiration will give him two great opportunities to wage
battle. Schumer said McConnell may not have the votes needed to break a Gorsuch
filibuster. Politico. http://politi.co/2nH8yz8

  * Republicans prob. won’t include funding for Thy God-Emperor Trump’s Mexico wall in the upcoming budget;
Republicans don’t want a shutdown battle in Apr and thus could exclude wall funding from
the budget as a result – Politico http://politi.co/2ncanQO

  * Thy God-Emperor Trump on Tues to sign an executive order that would begin the process of undoing much
of Obama’s climate agenda – Thy God-Emperor Trump’s order would instruct regulators to rewrite key rules
curbing US carbon emissions, lift a moratorium on federal coal leasing, and remove the
requirement that federal officials consider the impact of climate change when making
decisions. Most of the Thy God-Emperor Trump order will take years to implement and is unlikely to alter
the shift away from coal and towards nat. gas and renewables. Washington Post.
http://wapo.st/2mLwUbQ

  * Thy God-Emperor Trump’s climate order won’t help either energy independence or coal mining employment
– the US already consumes all its own coal and coal mining jobs have been cut by
automation and increased nat. gas demand. NYT http://nyti.ms/2nven2f

  * Company-specific news update from Tues morning. Wolseley is one of the top stocks in
the SXXP after posting solid earnings. Credit Suisse said it would make a decision on capital
“as soon as possible”. Ericsson was hit at the open after issuing a restructuring update but
the stock has since bounced. Redrow said it will not make a bid for Bovis. Two of Tesco’s
largest shareholders are calling on the co to drop its bid for Booker. Akzo Nobel said it
would provide a strategy update on Apr 19.

  * Company-specific news update from Mon night. RHT’s results were strong, esp. the blowout
billings number for the Feb-end Q. SNX also was solid (better Feb-end results and inline
earnings). DRI reported earnings ahead of the St and announced plans to buy Cheddar’s for
$780MM in cash. Red Mountain sent a letter to DECK’s board and called on the co to
explore strategic alternatives. HOMB announced plans to buy SGBK. ALXN named a new
CEO.
 
  * China/semiconductors – Tsinghua Unigroup, China’s largest chipmaker, has secured ~$22B
in financing to pursue M&A and build production capacity. Unigroup is in the process of
building a massive ~$30B memory plant. China in total plans to spend $150B over the next
10 years to secure a leading position in the global semi industry. Bloomberg.
http://bloom.bg/2otzBvd

  * CMCSA – the co is planning to rebrand and expand its streaming TV product. The new
service, which will be marked as Xfinity Instant TV, will cost $15-40/month and will be made
available to the >50MM homes within the CMCSA footprint. Reuters.
http://cnb.cx/2o1b4RC

  * Bond buyers return w/a vengeance – the WSJ discusses the recent rally in Treasuries as
“Thy God-Emperor Trump Trades” reverse. WSJ. http://on.wsj.com/2otqfQb

  * Italy – despite all the anxiety around Thy God-Emperor Trump and France, the market’s biggest political risk is
still Italy. WSJ. http://on.wsj.com/2ndmKgq

  * Iranian oil minister says global oil cuts deal likely to be extended – Reuters
http://reut.rs/2mLA8fu

 * Bank lending update from JPM’s D Silver - commercial bank lending has cooled notably in
recent months. Bank lending often weakens around recessions, and there has been some
concern over the recent slowing. But there are also a few instances in which bank lending
firmed again after a mid-expansion moderation, and we are not especially alarmed by the
recent slowing in the data. Given many signs that business investment has strengthened
more recently, we think the bank lending data will eventually firm. http://bit.ly/2o16zXg

 * Wall St research – Reuters discusses the “period of turmoil” facing the research industry
due to upcoming regulatory changes. Online research portals could gain share at the
expense of “bulge bracket” investment banks. According to one study, ~40K research
reports are produced every week by the world’s top 15 global investment banks but only 1%
are actually consumed by clients. Reuters http://reut.rs/2oc0Riq

#Washington – what comes next?

 * The next major issue to be addressed in Washington concerns the budget as the present
spending authorization is due to expire on Apr 28 – failure to sign a new budget (or a
Continuing Resolution) by that date could result in a “shutdown”. A shutdown on its own
wouldn’t be a major headache for stocks or the economy although at this time on gov’t
stoppage would probably have negative consequences as it 1) would reinforce the message
sent by the ACHA failure of Washington being hopelessly deadlocked and 2) raise doubts
about Washington acting smoothly on the debt ceiling (the debt ceiling probably doesn’t
have to be raised until later in the summer or early fall).

  * On taxes, the GOP is aggressively pivoting but there is a lot of work left to do. The
Ryan/Brady BAT bill is the only tax legislation that actually exists but (as has the case for
months) this bill can’t pass the Senate; if Ryan insists on commencing the tax debate w/his
BAT blueprint as the base case that could cause months of contentious negotiations and
drag the process into the fall at least (Brady’s House Ways and Means Committee has a
meeting Tues 3/28 at which it will discuss taxes). Thy God-Emperor Trump will play a big role – the White
House largely outsourced healthcare to Ryan but by getting involved early w/taxes it could
help steer the process towards a bill capable of passing both the House and Senate.

  * Without BATs and the ACHA savings it will be very difficult for any tax legislation to be
“revenue neutral” which means the GOP will have to 1) secure some Democratic support in
the Senate to overcome a likely filibuster or 2) sunset any changes after 10 years (like the
George W Bush tax cuts). Erstwhile GOP deficit hawks seem a bit more amenable to
unfinanced tax cuts (Meadows, the chair of the House Freedom Caucus, this weekend said
taxes don’t have to be revenue neutral) but they are unlikely to countenance enormous
deficits.
 

  * The market right now assumes the corporate rate can be cut to ~25% (or lower) when all is
said and done – anything higher than that number is likely to underwhelm. The “easiest”
bill to pass would likely be some combination of a repatriation holiday and infrastructure
spending (this is likely going to be the fallback solution if taxes stay deadlocked into the late
fall) although passing either alone would likely foreclose the possibility of broader tax
action. Markets appreciate that tax reform won’t happen by Aug and most don’t even think
it can happen this year. However, investors are hoping to see a credible and passable
blueprint by the fall that can get to Thy God-Emperor Trump’s desk by early 2018.

#Calendar of events to watch for the week of Mon Mar 27

  * There aren’t many major events scheduled this week other than some eco data (the most
important of which will likely be the US Feb PCE on Fri 3/31) and a few earnings reports.

  * Calendar for Wed 3/29 – the focus will be on the UK triggering of Article 50, US pending
home sales for Feb (10amET), some Fed speakers (Evans, Rosengren, and Williams), some

SCWX, UNF pre-open and LULU and WOR after the close).

  * Calendar for Thurs 3/30 – the focus will be on some Fed speakers (Mester, Kaplan, Dudley,
and Williams), analyst meetings (AKAM, TECK), and earnings (SAIC pre-open).

Mar (9:45amET), Michigan confidence numbers for Mar (10amET), and earnings (BBRY preopen).

"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning April 20th, 2020",287,g3oglv,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g3oglv/wall_street_week_ahead_for_the_trading_week/,24,2020-04-18 20:05:02,"Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 20th, 2020.

# **A blast of earnings news is coming, but the market may be more focused on when the economy will reopen  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/17/a-blast-of-earnings-news-is-coming-but-the-market-may-be-more-focused-on-when-the-economy-will-reopen.html)**
*****
> Earnings from IBM, Netflix, Coca-Cola and dozens of others are expected in the week ahead, but as the state shutdowns now reach the one-month threshold, the market is more likely to trade on virus headlines and news about reopening the economy.
*****
> There are also some important economic reports, including existing home sales on Monday and durable goods on Friday. But it is the weekly jobless claims data that will again be most relevant, as economists watch to see whether the number of workers seeking claims has now peaked and whether there are any signs some are returning to jobs, as government funds reach the hands of business owners.
*****
> In the past week, stocks were higher, but there was a divergence with the Dow up just under 2.2% at 24,242, and Nasdaq, surging 6%, lifted by tech and biotech. The S&P 500 gained 3% for the week and is now 31% off its March lows.
*****
> Stocks gained amid signs the virus outbreak has peaked and some reopenings could start slowly in the next few weeks.
*****
> The market also bounced Friday as the results of an early study of a Gilead drug showed promise with severe cases of coronavirus. Technology stocks were up about 4% for the week, and health care was up more than 5% while consumer discretionary stocks led with a gain of more than 6%.
*****
> “As the virus news goes, so go risk assets. People expect bad economic data,” said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist at Incapital. “The data is all expected to be horrible. The only economic data we can really look at now and start to measure is the claims data on Thursday.” As of April 11, more than 22 million workers claimed unemployment benefits over a four-week period, as states shut down and schools, restaurants, stores and many other businesses closed or were forced to cut back.
*****
> Charts are important
> Analysts who watch stock charts say technical levels will continue to have a powerful pull on the market, since so many traders have set their computers to trade around those numbers.
*****
> For instance, the S&P 500 had a hard time breaking through the 50-day moving average Friday, and fell back after it initially edged near 2,862 in morning trading. But at the end of the trading day, it smashed through that level, surging to close at 2,874, a positive sign for Monday’s open. The 50-day literally is the average closing price for the S&P over the previous 50 sessions. Technical analysts believe watching moving averages gives them an important tool for price trends and momentum.
*****
> Bob Doll, Nuveen’s chief equity strategist, said he believes the market hit its bear market low on March 23, but it could take another dive towards lows at some point.
*****
> “My [low] target was 2,350. We spent 36 hours below that and got to 2,192. If there’s a secondary low, then probably the lowest chance is 2,350,” he said. “I’m not sure we’re going to go there, based on two things, the power of the rally and two, the stimulus. It’s been awesome.”
*****
> Travelers, and Texas Instruments release results Tuesday. AT&T, Delta Airlines, and Intel, Blackstone and Eli Lily are reporting Thursday. American Express and Verizon are expected Friday.
*****
> Doll said he expects the market to listen to comments from corporate executives on conference calls but ignore the actual earnings. “The market is going to pay a lot more attention to what can a rebound look like, and what can 2021 numbers look like,” he said. “They’ll be selling on that versus how deep is the hole going to be in the second quarter. The macro questions around that are recurrence, therapeutics, and vaccine and how fast can the economy come back, and nobody knows the answer to that.”
*****
> President Donald Trump laid out guidelines for reopening the economy, but left the decision making up to the states, which are facing varied levels of new infections. One issue is the lack of testing, and American businesses have pressed for more availability of test kits so workers can be brought back more safely.
*****
> Doll said he is partial to health care and technology stocks, and one reason is because of the Fed’s quantitative easing programs. “We’re now in QE4. We had QE1, QE2, QE3, and six months after QE 1, 2 and 3, there were two sectors that outperformed-technology and health care, and there were two that underperformed, utilities and REITs,” he said.
*****
> Doll said he also is looking at how stocks might come through the virus shutdowns. “Part of what you want to make sure is the company is going to make it through, and make sure the industry has decent demand getting out of it. If it has decent demand during it, that’s a good thing, and that takes you back to health care and technology,” said Doll.
*****
> Leary said he expects companies to be scrutinized somewhat differently by analysts this quarter, and balance sheets will be more important.
*****
> “Its going to be on a case-by-case basis about how analysts are going to look at them. This is not a typical recession. Recessions seem to hit different sectors,” he said, “This one one is different in that it really has several losers like airlines and travel and entertainment companies. It has some real winners too. I like health care and pharma. Anything that’s defensive in nature is going to perform well.”
*****
> Companies have been tapping the corporate bond market at a record pace to boost their cash piles to help them through the economy’s shutdown, and the coming week should be no different.
*****
> The corporate debt market has been open for business and spreads have narrowed since the Fed announced a program to buy corporate debt. Companies have issued more than $160 billion in investment grade bonds so far this month, with JP Morgan issuing $10 billion this past week in the biggest bank deal ever, according to Credit Flow Research.
*****
> More are expected in the coming week, as companies report earnings and exit the blackout period.
*****
> “I think what corporate treasurers know is the window of opportunity for issuing debt at reasonable rates will quickly close once the economy starts opening,” said Leary. He said balance sheets and earnings will be more scrutinized once things start to become more normal.
*****
> “They won’t have an excuse anymore ... right now, everything is expected to unexpected,” he said, “I think that window will close, and we’ll have to take a look at the bond market again. Their ability to issue will be impacted by their balance sheets...[now] there’s plenty of cash coming at them. The Fed will step in to support.”
*****
> Leary said some of the interest in corporate bonds is from investors who are fearful of buying stocks right now but may want to invest in a company through the safer play of its bonds. Leary said energy bonds are among the least desirable, with the huge drop in crude prices.
*****
> West Texas Intermediate crude futures for May settled at $18.72 per barrel, it lowest level since January, 2002. But that contract expires Tuesday. The June contract settled at $25.08 per barrel, and will resume trading there next week as the active contract.
*****
> “It’s just a reflection of physical market conditions,” said John Kilduff of Again Capital, of the big decline in the May contract. He said it shows that futures traders do not want to actually take delivery of the commodity, due to an increasing lack of storage space.

# How Markets Performed During the Spanish Flu

> With equities surging into the close ahead of the weekend, traders are shrugging their shoulders wondering how the hell the market is rallying given the economic damage inflicted by the COVID-19 outbreak, which has been cited as the worst pandemic to hit the United States since the 1918 Spanish flu. This leads to the question, how did the stock market perform during the Spanish flu outbreak? The chart below compares the performance of the DJIA to the weekly mortality rate of the Spanish flu during each of the waves of that pandemic from mid-1918 through early 1919 (as cited in a WSJ article earlier today).

> Looking at how the outbreak of the Spanish flu played out, there were basically three different waves of the virus (red line). The first wave in the summer of 1918 was a relatively mild one compared to the other two, and the DJIA's performance during that wave was essentially flat as it never declined more than 3%. The real damage from the Spanish flu was in the fall of 1918 when the mortality rate spiked up as high as 24 per 1,000 people per week. During that wave of the pandemic, which also came in the thick of a post-WWI recession, the DJIA peaked just as the wave was getting underway and fell for the next three months. Even with the severity of the outbreak during that wave, though, the DJIA never fell more than 11% from peak to trough. On a comparative basis, even after the 28% rally over the last four weeks, the S&P 500 is still down 15% from its high. Obviously, comparing two periods more than 100 years apart is hardly an apples to apples comparison, but it's still interesting that during what was an even deadlier pandemic in 1918, the DJIA never even approached anything close to a bear market.

> Looking at the chart, the DJIA's low of the decline coincided with the second wave of the outbreak just as the third (more mild) wave of the pandemic was getting underway. Furthermore, during that third wave, the DJIA kicked off what was a strong rally of more than 25% in less than three months on optimism over an end to the outbreak.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/041720-DJIA-flue.png))**

> So, once the mortality rate of the Spanish flu dropped down to zero, it must have been nothing but clear skies ahead for the Dow, right? Well, not necessarily. When it comes to the stock market, there's always something. Less than a year after the mortality rate from the Spanish flu dropped down to zero, the US economy actually went into a year and a half long recession. That contraction was so severe that it has been dubbed the Depression of 1920/21, one where unemployment topped 10% and deflation was as high as 18%! The bear market that accompanied that recession was also severe as the DJIA declined 46%. Imagine coming out of a pandemic with nothing more than an 11% correction and then getting socked with that!

# Silver Shining in the Near Term, Gold Shining Over the Long Term

> Gold (GLD) has had an interesting run over the past year. Last spring, the ETF for the yellow metal finally pressed above multiyear resistance roughly around $130. After surging through late summer, GLD continued its rally at the end of 2019 and early 2020 before turning sharply lower alongside stocks in March. But since its March 19th low it has gone on to rally over 17% as of today and is now at its highest levels since early 2013.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/GLD.png))**

> Another precious metal, Silver (SLV), has not been as fortunate. Although it shared in the rally last spring and summer, SLV has yet to eclipse its early September highs. While gold had broken out again in February and March, silver put in a lower high before plummeting to its lost level since 2009 in mid-March.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/SLV.png))**

> But since that low on March 18th, SLV has actually outperformed rising 27.83%. Gold is up only up 15.14% since that same day and 17% since its respective low one day later on March 19th. While the S&P 500's (SPY) low was not put in place until a few days after gold and silver on March 23rd, since March 18th, SLV is also outperforming SPY's 15.97% gain.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/Performance-1.png))**

> Over the long term, though SLV is still the worst performer of the group. As shown in the chart below, SLV is down 8.84% over the past two years while the S&P 500's gains have also been somewhat lackluster thanks to the most recent sell-off with only a 4.11% gain. Gold, on the other hand, has outshined the other two having surged 26.93%.

# It’s Earnings Season (Or Whatever it is Companies Plan to Report)

> It’s that time of year again. The time when corporate America reports financial results for the prior three months. Normally, we call it earnings season, but given the fact that most of the US economy has been shut down and no timetable is set for when it re-opens, for a lot of companies out there, there really isn’t much in the way of earnings, revenues, or guidance to speak of. Instead, this reporting period will likely be a lot of companies trying to put the best spin on how much (or little) cash they have on hand to withstand the shutdown.

> Besides the major banks and financials, there hasn’t been a whole lot in the way of reports to speak of, but of the results we have seen, the stock market reaction hasn’t been great as companies like Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), JP Morgan (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), Bank of America (BAC), and Goldman Sachs (GS) have all seen negative reactions to their reports. The only large-cap that has really reacted positively to earnings so far is UnitedHealth (UNH) which gained more than 4%. Next week, the pace of reports will pick up, but the peak period for reports won’t be for another two weeks when more than 300 companies will report in a single day.

# Typical April Trading: Strength from Start to Finish

> April, the last month of DJIA & S&P 500 “Best Six Months,” has a strong historical track record. April 1999 was the first month DJIA gained over 1000 points (10.25%). April is also DJIA’s best month since 1950 with an average 1.9% gain. After a disastrous March, the rally than began in late March has extended in April. As of yesterday’s close, DJIA is up 7.39% so far this April. S&P 500 is up 8.32%, NASDAQ has risen 10.81%. Small caps, measured by the Russell 2000 have not fared as well, up just 2.17%.

> April’s historical performance over the recent 21-year period is plotted in the chart above (21-year average is on the left vertical scale) compared to April 2020 (right vertical scale). Magnitude of gains this year is substantial however, the trend this year has been similar to past years. Should the current trend remain intact, further gains this month are possible. Coronavirus uncertainty remains extremely elevated, but there does to be some light flickering at the end of tunnel.

#[Today's Top Headlines for Monday, March 30th, 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/30/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-march-30-2020.html)

*****

> * U.S. stock futures were pointing to a modest decline for the Dow Jones Industrial Average at Monday’s open after President Donald Trump extended national social distancing guidelines to April 30. The Dow, which closed 4% lower Friday, did soar 12.8% for the week, logging its best weekly gain since 1938 and raising questions about whether blue chips have bottomed. However, heading into Monday’s session, the Dow was still nearly 27% off last month’s record highs. The yield on the 10-year Treasury remained below 1% early Monday. U.S. oil prices sank below $20 per barrel, near 18-year lows hit earlier this month.

*****

> * On Sunday, mortgage bankers warned that Federal Reserve mortgage purchases are unbalancing the home lending market. In addition to the Fed’s extraordinary no limit fixed-income purchases, Wall Street analysts and economists said it would not be out of the question to see the central bank take for the first time ever a passive interest in the performance of the stock market.

*****

> * Preparing the nation for a death toll that could exceed 100,000 from the coronavirus, Trump on Sunday walked back his previous remarks about wanting to reopen the country for business by Easter. In continuing social distancing until the end of next month, the president said, “Nothing would be worse than declaring victory before the victory has been won.” Earlier on Sunday, White House health advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said the country could see up to 200,000 deaths and millions of infections. However, he also cautioned that those numbers are based on outbreak modeling and nothing is certain.

*****

> * The U.S., which has the most known coronavirus infections in the world, saw confirmed cases jump to over 143,000 with 2,513 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University data. New York has about 40% of those cases and fatalities. A field hospital has been set up inside New York’s Central Park to treat coronavirus patients. Abbott Laboratories, which received FDA emergency use authorization on Friday for a test that can detect coronavirus in 5 minutes, was praised by Trump. “Abbott has stated that they will begin delivering 50,000 tests each day, starting this week,” he said. Abbott shares were soaring about 8% in the premarket.

*****

> * Global coronavirus cases increased to over 730,000 with 34,685 deaths and more than 149,000 recoveries. Italy, No. 2 to the U.S. in cases with about 97,700, has the worst death toll. Italy’s 10,779 fatalities are more than three times as many as China’s 3,308 deaths. Rounding out the top three, Spain just surpassed China in infections, with over 85,000 cases and more than double China’s death toll at 6,803. China, where the pandemic started in December, has the world’s fourth most known infections, nearing 82,200 cases. Germany is No. 5 in worldwide cases at about 62,400. It has 541 deaths.

*****

> * Amazon warehouse workers in Staten Island, one of the five boroughs of New York City, plan to strike on Monday to call attention to what they claim is the lack of protections for employees. Chris Smalls, a management assistant and a lead organizer of the strike, told CNBC that workers at the fulfillment center known as JFK8, have grown increasingly concerned about coming into work after an employee tested positive for the coronavirus there last week. Amazon told CNBC that the company was supporting the individual in quarantine and asked anyone who was in contact with the worker to stay home with pay for two weeks. JFK8 remains open.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 23rd, 2021.

# **Fed officials will seek to avoid a tantrum as they keep ‘taper talk’ going at Jackson Hole - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/20/fed-officials-will-seek-to-avoid-a-tantrum-as-they-keep-taper-talk-going-at-jackson-hole.html)**
*****
> The Federal Reserve’s efforts to reverse its easy policy will be a dominant theme for markets in the week ahead, as central bankers gather in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.
*****
> The central bankers may even look relaxed against the backdrop of the Grand Tetons in the crisp late August air. But they will be under pressure to gently steer toward less policy support, without creating a market tantrum.
*****
> Federal Reserve officials, in numerous recent speeches and interviews, have already managed to speed up expectations for when they could begin to slowly pare back their $120 billion a month in bond purchases. More of that talk is expected at their annual symposium, which begins Thursday.
*****
> The Fed chairman’s speech is typically the highlight of the annual event, and various Fed chairs have used Jackson Hole to send important messages. The question is whether Jerome Powell will channel his speech Friday morning to provide more details on how the Fed could begin to unwind its bond buying, and even whether he is personally ready to embrace it.
*****
> “We’re not expecting a big policy reveal at this meeting,” said Mark Cabana, head of U.S. short strategy at Bank of America. “I don’t think Powell wants to front run the [September] meeting, given the myriad of voices that are out there. I don’t think this is the time when Powell really wants to make a splash.”
*****
> Besides the Fed, the week has a few economic reports. Existing home sales are released Monday; new home sales Tuesday and durable goods Wednesday. Friday has personal consumption expenditures data and the inflation index, closely watched by the Fed.
*****
> Earnings are also expected from companies including Best Buy and Nordstrom on Tuesday, Salesforce.com on Wednesday and HP and Dell Technologies on Thursday.
*****
> # Fed and markets
But the Fed will matter most, as investors will also keep an eye on how the economy is responding to the spread of the Covid delta variant. Stocks were lower in the past week, with the S&P 500 down 0.6%.
*****
> There could be some volatility around the Fed’s symposium, after the release this past Tuesday of minutes from the last official meeting rattled investors. The minutes described most members of the Federal Open Market Committee as being ready to taper this year if the economy is strong enough. Cabana said he changed his view after that release and now expects the Fed to begin paring back purchases in November, rather than January.
*****
> “We just think this signal in communications is pretty clear,” he said. “For now, it’s safe to say they are wanting to start later this year, and we think the data will allow them to do that.”
*****
> As for Powell, “he’s not going to announce taper. What we anticipate is that he’s going to give a live speech that talks about a lot of the progress that has been made since the start of Covid, and there’s a lot of it,” said Cabana. He said Powell could reiterate that the Fed will be data dependent in its decision to taper, and that many Fed officials believe it could make sufficient progress toward that goal later this year.
*****
> The minutes caused hiccups in markets as investors reacted to the idea that the Fed will take its first steps toward peeling away the extraordinary amount of policy it used to fight the impact of the pandemic. Tapering the bond program could take months, but once it ends it could herald the onset of rate hikes.
*****
> Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton, said Powell should provide a road map for how the Fed will taper, but with the caveat of being able to step back if Covid becomes more serious than expected.
*****
> “The asset purchases were initially to stabilize financial conditions. ... There’s clearly a consensus building stronger than it even was at the last meeting in July, given how [Fed officials] have been speaking out since then,” said Swonk. “They want to wind down asset purchases. As they wind them down, they’re not hitting the brakes. They’re only lifting their foot off the accelerator. The difference is important for [Powell] to lay out at Jackson Hole.”
*****
> Swonk said the Fed needs to provide a road map for tapering, but also with off ramps in the event that Covid is worse than expected.
*****
> “To avoid this becoming a tantrum and avoid financial markets seizing up again, he wants to get the messaging out and the context of it, as much as possible,” Swonk said. “If this becomes a disorderly reaction and things are melting down, they would have to pivot. Where we’re at is these types of purchases are no longer justified and may be detrimental in terms of how much liquidity they’re putting into financial markets when its no longer needed.”

> # September Almanac: DJIA, S&P 500 & NASDAQ Worst Month of Year

> Start of the business year, end of summer vacations, and back to school once made September a leading barometer month in first 60 years of 20th century, now portfolio managers back after Labor Day tend to clean house Since 1950, September is the worst performing month of the year for DJIA, S&P 500, NASDAQ (since 1971), Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 (since 1979). After four solid years from 1995-1998 during the dot.com bubble buildup, S&P 500 was down five Septembers straight from 1999-2003. In the 17 years since, S&P 500 has advanced 11 times in September and declined six times.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/40afab5bf8a7d5d83f5c0df66416bd63/64275cde73d35d0e-b1/s400x600/f24c1395359fa121818eb1387e2f2cde70364a83.jpg))**

> In post-election years, September’s overall rank improves modestly in post-election years going back to 1953 (third or fourth worst month depending on index). Average losses are little changed. Although September 2001 does influence the average declines, the fact remains DJIA and S&P 500 have declined in 9 of the last 17 post-election year Septembers. Russell 2000 has the best post-election year record, up seven times in 10 years.

> # US Dollar Breaks Out

> After roughly two months of declines, at the end of May the US dollar (proxied by Bloomberg's dollar index) found support around the lows from the first week of the year. Since then, the dollar has rallied 4.13%, moving back above its moving averages in the process which have also acted as support ever since. This week alone the dollar has gained 1.4%, and that upward move brings the dollar to the highest levels since early November and the early spring highs when the index stopped short of its 200-DMA.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/082021-Dollar.png))**

> Taking a step back to look at the past five years, those lows that were reached earlier this spring and at the start of the year can actually be traced all the way back to early 2018 lows. Similarly, the recent highs that were taken out this week are around the same levels as the early 2016 lows. With the dollar now having broken out, it is no longer at the low end of that five-year range.

> # One of the Best Weeks of the Year for Claims

> Initial jobless claims hit another pandemic low this week dropping to 348K from last week's 2K upwardly revised reading of 377K. That was also 16K below expectations and the first better than expected print in six weeks. While recent releases have disappointed relative to forecasts, this week did mark the fourth week in a row that claims have dropped. That is the longest stretch of consecutive declines since a six-week streak ending on June 4th.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081921-Initial-Jobless-Claims-SA.png))**

> On a non-seasonally adjusted basis, initial claims fell to 308.57K which is again the lowest level since the start of the pandemic. Meanwhile, pandemic unemployment assistance claims ticked up to 109.38K from 103.85K the previous week. The main state driving that increase was Ohio which saw claims more than double. Maryland, Oregon, and California were the other states to have seen the biggest increase in PUA claims. Those increases also come even as the program is slated to end in just two weeks on September 4th.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081921-Initial-Jobless-Claims-NSA.png))**

> As for the decline in claims for unadjusted regular state programs, we would caution against reading too deep into the number on account of strong seasonal tailwinds. As shown below, the current week of the year (33rd) is tied at second for the week of the year that most often sees claims decline. As shown in the second chart below, there has only been one year, last year, in which claims were higher week over week in the 33rd week of the year.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081921-Initial-Jobless-Claims-Seasonal-1a.png))**

> Seasonally adjusted continuing claims missed expectations by 20K this week, but at 2.82 million, this week's reading still marked a third consecutive decline. As such, claims are still at the lowest level of the pandemic and are closing in on coming within one million from the March 2020 levels.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081921-Con-Jobless-Claims-SA.png))**

> While the most recent reading on continuing claims was lower, purely looking at regular state claims does not show the full picture. Including all other programs creates some additional lag meaning the most recent data is through the last week of July. Through that week, total claims fell below 12 million for the first time of the pandemic, totaling 11.76 million. Driving that decline were 79.9K and 66.08K declines in regular state and PEUC programs. The biggest decline came from the extended benefits program, though. That program saw claims get more than cut in half after a significant uptick the previous week. Throughout the month of July, claim counts for the extended benefits program were particularly volatile. They started off the month with a sub-100K reading of 98.4K, then rose all the way up to 343.5K, dropped to 239.6K, then rose again to 398.8K before falling back down to 177.9K in the week of July 30th.

> # Homebuilder Sentiment: The Next Big Miss

> Prior to the pandemic, the NAHB's record monthly reading on homebuilder sentiment was back in December 1998 when the index hit 78. Last November, the sentiment bar was set even higher when the index reached 90. Since then, though, two-thirds of the releases have declined month over month. The most recent release saw the index drop five more points to 75, marking the first time in a year that homebuilder sentiment came in below the pre-pandemic record high. Additionally, August's 5-point drop is the largest one-month decline since last April when the index collapsed by a record 42 points at the onset of the pandemic. It is also tied with a dozen other months for the seventh-largest month-over-month decline in the history of the index going back to 1985.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081721-NAHB-1a.png))**

> While the release indicates worsening, but still historically strong, sentiment among homebuilders, it can be added to the growing list of economic indicators that have been coming in well below expectations. As we noted in last week's Bespoke Report, Citi Surprise indices measuring how economic data comes in relative to estimates tipped into negative territory last week. That was as the University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment survey saw the biggest miss relative to expectations on record. Today's reading on homebuilders was not far off those results. The five-point miss relative to expectations was the largest since last April and is tied with 4 other months (April and May 2006, November 2008, and October 2014) for the six largest miss going back to at least 2003.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081721-NAHB-1b.png))**

> Driving the decline in the headline reading were five-point drops in present sales and traffic. Even though there has been deterioration in those readings on current conditions, future sales have held up better going unchanged at 81.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081721-NAHB-3.png))**

> Looking across regions, the ones that have seen COVID cases rising the most of late, namely in the South and Midwest, generally saw sharp drops in homebuilder sentiment in August although those are in the context of longer-term declines. The Northeast and the West, on the other hand, are off of their peaks but each region did show an uptick in sentiment for August.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

*****

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend a great trading week ahead r/wallstreetbets. :)",0.0,2021-08-21,0
"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning August 30th, 2021",82,pd8xfn,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pd8xfn/wall_street_week_ahead_for_the_trading_week/,27,2021-08-28 18:00:17,"Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 30th, 2021.

# **A key jobs report in the week ahead could drive the next big market move - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/27/a-key-jobs-report-in-the-week-ahead-could-drive-the-next-big-market-move.html)**
*****
> With Jackson Hole in the rear-view mirror, August’s employment report could be the next driver for markets.
*****
> Stocks gained in the past week, surging again to new highs Friday after a speech by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. The chairman acknowledged that Fed officials expect to taper back their $120 billion a month bond-buying program this year, a first step toward reversing easy policy.
*****
> Powell was speaking at the Kansas City Fed’s annual Jackson Hole, Wyo. symposium, held virtually this year. He said the Fed has seen sufficient progress on inflation, but the labor market has not yet improved enough to start the taper. Importantly, he also emphasized that the wind down of the bond program does not mean the Fed will automatically move on to raise interest rate hikes.
*****
> “Powell has made it clear the Fed is not prepared to raise interest rates anytime soon. The market seems relieved by that. … With some of the economic data already slowing, I think interest rate hikes are far, far away, and investors are happy about that,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist for the US SPDR business at State Street Global Advisors.
*****
> Arone said the Fed has so far avoided a “taper tantrum,” similar to the 2013 market sell-off when the Fed announced it was rolling back quantitative easing. Powell’s speech was widely anticipated to clarify the Fed’s position on its $120 billion monthly bond purchases, after a number of Fed officials called for the start of a wind down.
*****
> # Jobs are the focal point
*****
> Now, market focus shifts even more fiercely to jobs data, with the release Friday of the August employment report.
*****
> “For sure, the market is going to react,” said Jim Caron, head of macro strategies for global fixed income at Morgan Stanley Investment Management. “I think it’s important. I think the issue that they’re going to have is unemployment benefits don’t really run out until the beginning of September. It’s really not until you get the October jobs number that you get a more free look at September.”
*****
> The dollar index sank after Powell’s Friday morning speech, as stocks rallied to new highs and Treasury yields fell. Other data in the coming week includes consumer confidence Tuesday and Wednesday’s release of Institute for Supply Management manufacturing data and ADP’s private sector payroll data, a kind of preview for Friday’s government jobs report.
*****
> “I wouldn’t be surprised to see follow-through Monday and Tuesday, but ahead of ADP on Wednesday, I’d look for position adjusting which means weaker stocks and weaker bonds and stronger dollar ahead of the jobs data,” said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex.
*****
> He said Powell was dovish, as expected, while still emphasizing that tapering was coming. But the key for markets was that he stressed the end of the program does not mean “tightening” or rate hikes. The 10-year Treasury yield had risen above 1.35% this week, but fell to 1.3% after Powell spoke Friday.
*****
> # U.S. 10-year Treasury yield
*****
> “The market will get cautious again ahead of the jobs data. Then it’s a new world into September. You have to wait until after the jobs data to see if these moves have sustaining power. This is ‘a buy the rumor, sell the fact’ move,” Chandler said.
*****
> Some market pros had expected an announcement on tapering from the Fed at its September meeting, but that view has now mostly changed to a November or December announcement. “Because of the uncertainty of delta, I think it will take more than the next jobs report,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton. “The disruption to jobs in particular is if schools have to close again.”
*****
> Economists polled by Dow Jones expect 750,000 jobs were created in August and the unemployment rate fell to 5.2%. In July, the economy created 943,000 jobs and unemployment slid to 5.4%. Education was a big contributor in July, with 261,000 jobs added in public schools and private education.
*****
> “It doesn’t have to be a spectacular number to satisfy their needs,” said Swonk of the August report. “You need a solid jobs number, something north of a half million... I think we’re going to be close to that. They’re going to want to see September employment as well.”
*****
> # Market risks
*****
> State Street’s Arone said the Fed’s discussion of the tapering will be top of mind in the markets, just as the next earnings season rolls around.
*****
> “It will be interesting at a time when the Fed starts taking its foot off the pedal,” he said. “Right now, the bull case continues to be reasonably strong, but markets don’t go straight up. If I was going to key on a specific risk, I’d keep an eye on third quarter earnings reports, and more importantly what corporate executives are saying about next year.”
*****
> Arone said strong earnings has been the biggest driver of market gains, helping investors ignore worries about the spread of the Covid delta variant, the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, and dysfunction in Washington.
*****
> The market’s summer rally continued in the past week, with the Dow ending at 35,455, up just about 1% for the week. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both ended the week at record highs.
*****
> The S&P 500 was up 1.5% at 4,509, and the Nasdaq rose 2.8% to 15,129.
*****
> “The market has been able to ignore all this noise and rally,” he said, adding it would be ironic if it were earnings that caused a sell-off and not a Fed policy change or something else.
*****
> He said the market could get choppy in September and into October, a seasonally weak time of year for stocks.
*****
> “We caught a glimpse of this this quarter, with big tech — where the numbers were beating, but they suggested that future quarters would see slower growth,” Arone said. “Investors didn’t like that, and I think it gave us a glimpse of what happens if it spreads beyond the technology sector to other sectors.”
*****
> There are a few earnings in the coming week, including Zoom Video Monday, Campbell Soup Wednesday, and Hewlett Packard and Broadcom Thursday.
*****
> # Watching Ida
*****
> The oil and gas industry is closely watching Hurricane Ida, which was heading straight for Louisiana. Oil, gasoline and natural gas all rallied Friday, as energy companies shut down Gulf of Mexico production ahead of the storm. Louisiana is also home to a number of refineries.
*****
> West Texas Intermediate futures settled up nearly 2% Friday, at $68.74 per barrel. The benchmark U.S. crude was up more than 10% for the week, its best weekly gain since June 5, 2020.

> # Small Cap Labor Day Rally Getting Underway

> In the below chart, daily data since July 1, 1979 through August 20, 2021 for the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies are divided by the Russell 1000 index of largest companies, and then compressed into a single year to show an idealized yearly pattern. When the graph is descending, large-cap companies are outperforming small-cap companies; when the graph is rising, smaller companies are moving up faster than their larger brethren. The most prominent period of outperformance generally begins in mid-December and lasts until late-February or early March with a surge in January. This period of outperformance by small-caps is known as the “January Effect” in the annual Stock Trader’s Almanac.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/ee23ad03da0bcf4a9f8869976521a446/51d39e9e109dc4da-47/s500x750/7dc9cb9b15e57125a71f2475fad23ab6ccd1423e.jpg))**

> In recent years, another sizable move is quite evident just before Labor Day. One possible explanation for this move is individual investors begin to return to work after summertime vacations and are searching for “bargain” stocks. In a typical year, small-caps would have been lagging and could represent an opportunity relative to other large-cap possibilities. As of today’s close, Russell 2000 is up 13.4% compared to the Russell 1000 being up 19.0% year-to-date. Lagging small-caps and resilient U.S. consumers could be the ideal setup for a repeat of this pattern this year. However, the small-cap advantage does historically wane around mid-September.

*****

> # Small-Caps Bounce

> ln today's Morning Lineup, we noted the inverse correlation between performance this week and market caps. As shown in the major US Indices screen of our Trend Analyzer tool, the two best performers over the past five days have been Micro-Caps (IWC) followed by small caps like the Russell 2000 (IWM) and the Core S&P Small-Cap ETF (IJR). Mid-cap ETFs are the next best performers with high 2% gains then most large cap indices have only risen around 1.5% this week with the exception of the Dow (DIA) which has not even gained 1%. As for where these indices are trading relative to each one's trading range, it is partially a mean reversion story. Small caps were deeply oversold one week ago and are now sitting just below their 50-DMAs. While not to as extreme of a degree, mid-caps were similarly trading a full standard deviation below their 50-DMAs last week. Today, they are on the opposite side of their 50-DMAs and on the verge of overbought readings.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/indices0827.png))**

> As previously mentioned, small caps like the Micro-Cap ETF (IWC) and Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) were oversold last week. From a charting perspective, each of these indices' rallies this week are not only bounces from extreme oversold levels, but they also follow brief dips below their 200-DMAs. But whereas the past five days have seen solid gains, yesterday saw IWC and IWM reject their 50-DMAs and the high end of their ranges that have been in place since late July. In other words, even though small caps have led the market this week, they are not out of the woods yet.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/082721-IWM.png))**

> Looking at the relative strength lines of small caps like IWC and IWM versus the large cap S&P 500 (SPY) over the past year, the past week's outperformance again is a blip on the radar and has only put a small dent in the longer term trend of underperformance.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/082721-Small-v-Large2.png))**

> Where that is not necessarily the case is small market caps versus the smallest market caps. As shown below, the relative strength line of the Micro-Cap ETF (IWC) versus the Russell 2000 (IWM) broke out of the past few months' downtrend over the past few days.

> The S&P 500 Index made yet another new all-time high yesterday, the 50th on the year. “The all-time record for any one year is 77 S&P 500 new all-time highs back in 1995,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Incredibly, 2021 is currently on pace for 78 new highs. There’s a long way to go, but this has been an amazing year and this is yet another way to show it.”

> As impressive as 50 new highs is, investors need to remember that new highs happen in clusters that can last decades. We’ve been sharing this chart for years, saying exactly that: previous periods of new highs lasted much longer than most expected. Mark Twain said history doesn’t repeat itself, but it often rhymes. If history rhymes once again, we could still have several more years of new highs.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Blog-8.25.21-2.png?ssl=1))**

> Another interesting stat about S&P 500 all-time highs is every month so far in 2021 has seen a new high, 8 for 8. Only once have all 12 months made a new all-time high and that was in 2014. This is somewhat surprising, given the S&P 500 gained only 11.4% in 2014, but it was a very slow and persistent move. Most investors (including this author) would guess it was 1995, but that spectacular year saw new highs in ‘only’ 10 months.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Blog-8.25.21-3.png?ssl=1))**

> Although August tends to be historically weak for stocks, that hasn’t been the case this year. In fact, the S&P 500 has made an incredible 9 new highs already this month, the most since 1929. No, we don’t think this is another 1929, but this is just another way to show how astounding this bull run has been.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Blog-8.25.21-4.png?ssl=1))**

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, 50 new S&P 500 all-time highs before the end of August is quite a feat. In fact, only twice has the 50 level been cracked through the end of August, in 1964 and 1995.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Blog-8.25.21-5.png?ssl=1))**

> So what happens next? The rest of the year in 1964 the S&P 500 added 3.6%, while it added 9.6% in 1995. Below we looked at all the years with at least 30 new all-time highs through August and sure enough, better than average returns the rest of the year are common. The final 4 months gained 4.7%, versus the average final 4 months gain for all years of 3.6%. Now this is skewed due to 1987s crash, as that was the only time stocks were lower the final 4 months after more than 30 new highs by the end of August. Smoothing things out, the median return jumps up to a very impressive 5.4%, versus a median return of 3.6% for all years.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Blog-8.25.21-6.png?ssl=1))**

> 2021 is off to a roaring start and we continue to expect higher prices before all is said and done. The studies we did today do little to change our view. We’d use any potential weakness as an opportunity to add before potential higher prices.

> # Nasdaq Crosses Another 1,000 Point Threshold

> It won't be official until the close, but with the Nasdaq crossing 15,000 for the first time today, it's on pace to cross its third 1,000 point threshold this year and the sixth since the pandemic began in early 2020. The table below lists each 1,000 point threshold that the Nasdaq has crossed over time along with the first day that it crossed that threshold, the number of days since the prior cross, what percentage that 1,000 point consists of relative to the prior threshold, and then how many upside and downside crosses the Nasdaq has had around that level on a closing basis.

> Of all the 1,000 point thresholds the Nasdaq has crossed over time, the only one that it never traded back below after crossing it was 6,000 back in April 2017. Besides 1,000, that was also the 1,000 point threshold that took the longest to cross above. After first crossing 5,000 back in March 2000, it took 6,256 days for the Nasdaq to top 6,000. Since then, though, the Nasdaq has been making quick work of 1,000 point thresholds. With the exception of the 486-day gap between 8K and 9K, every other 1,000-point threshold since 6,000 has taken less than a year to cross. Even in the midst of a global pandemic, it took the Nasdaq less than six months to get from 9,000 to 10,000.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/082421-Nasdaq-Crosses.png))**

> The long-term chart of the Nasdaq below includes red dots to show each time the Nasdaq first crossed a 1,000 point threshold along with the number of days for each one.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/082421-Nasdaq-1000-Point-thresholds.png))**

> Looking at the chart above may give you a feeling of lightheadedness given the seemingly parabolic nature of the last few years. An important thing to keep in mind, though, is that as a percentage of the index's price level, every 1,000 point threshold represents a smaller move in percentage terms. While the move from 9K to 10K represented a move of over 11%, the move from 14K to 15K represents only a little more than 7%. Looking at this chart on a log scale where each label on the y-axis represents a doubling of the index shows how modest the recent 1,000 point thresholds have been relative to earlier ones. Think about it this way, in the less than two years between when the Nasdaq first crossed 2K to when it crossed 5K for the first time (four different 1,000 point thresholds), it rallied 150%. Over the last four years, though, the Nasdaq has crossed 10 different 1,000-point thresholds, but the gain has also only been 150%.

> # Bulls Head In Separate Directions

>As the major indices have set more record highs in the past week, bullish sentiment has rebounded. The American Association of Individual Investors' (AAII) weekly reading on bullish sentiment rose 6.4 percentage points to 39.4% this week. That is the highest reading of optimism since the week of July 8th when bullish sentiment was a hair above 40%. While recovered, that reading is still muted versus the past year's range and is only 1.5 percentage points above their historical average. In other words, bullish sentiment has rebounded but is far from elevated.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/082621-AAII-Bull.png))**

> While the AAII survey showed an increase in bullish sentiment, another survey of newsletter writers from Investors Intelligence saw the opposite result. This survey's reading on bullish sentiment dropped to just 50% this week which is the lowest level since May of last year. Although this reading has now fallen out of the past year's range, it is still slightly elevated versus the historical average of 45%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/082621-II-Bull.png))**

> Given the uptick in bullish sentiment, the AAII survey saw only a third of respondents report as bearish versus 35.1% last week. Like bullish sentiment, this reading remains outside of the range it has occupied for most of the past year although that current reading is also not far away from the historical average of 30.5%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/082621-AAII-Bear.png))**

> As we noted in last Thursday's Chart of the Day, the bull-bear spread dipped into negative territory last week for the first time since late January and it was at the lowest level since October 2020. With the inverse moves in bullish and bearish sentiment this week, the spread has moved back into positive territory to its highest level since the last week of July.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/082621-AAII-BB-Spread.png))**

> Not all of the gains to bullish sentiment came from the bearish camp. Neutral sentiment saw an even larger decline of 4.2 percentage points. That brings the reading down to 27.5% which is the lowest reading since April 15th when it stood at just 21.6%.

*****
> This week’s price action also overcame surging oil prices and a disappointing jobs report, with investors buying bank and energy shares.
*****
> “In the face of Washington drama, delta worries, multiyear highs in crude oil, and a much weaker than expected jobs number, you have to be impressed by how stocks were able to bounce back this week,” LPL Financial chief market strategist Ryan Detrick said.
*****

*****
> A market pullback that began in September brought the S&P 500 down more than 5% from its record at one point Monday, before stocks mounted a comeback. For the week, the S&P 500 added back 0.8% and sits just 3.4% away from its record.
*****
> Goldman Sachs stuck by its bullish year-end forecast earlier this week, predicting stocks would start to climb the wall of worries. And they did.
*****
> Goldman chief U.S. equity strategist David Kostin said in a note to clients that his year-end S&P 500 price target for 2021 is still 4,700, which is nearly 7% above its current level.
*****
> The firm said earnings growth, not valuation expansion, was the primary driver of the S&P 500′s 17% return year to date, adding that should still be the case.
*****
> # Earnings season begins
> The third-quarter earnings season — which kicks off next week with big bank earnings — is expected to be another strong series of reports, despite some worries about supply chain issues and higher costs. Third-quarter earnings are expected to have risen 27.6% year over year, according to FactSet. That would be the third-highest growth rate since 2010.
*****
> “We’ve seen some record earnings seasons the past few quarters, so all eyes will be on if earnings can help justify stocks near all-time high levels,” Detrick said. “We do expect another solid earnings season, but we’ve seen some high profile warnings already, so corporate America could have a rather high bar to clear this quarter. Buckle up.”
*****
> Bank earnings are the main focus next week with JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs set to report.
*****
> After a range-bound few months for bank stocks, analysts are looking ahead to catalysts that could fuel the next phase in their recovery. Wall Street expects loan growth, interest rates and reserve releases to play into the major banks’ reports.
*****
> “Earnings for the third quarter quarter should again be strong and mostly outpace expectations,” Leuthold Group chief investment strategist Jim Paulsen said. “Hours worked in the third quarter rose by about 5% suggesting real GDP for the quarter may be close to 7%. With most companies reporting strong pricing power, solid real GDP growth should result in another surprisingly strong corporate earnings season.”
*****
> Paulsen sees earnings season rewarding cyclicals, like banks, and small caps more than technology stocks.
*****
> “I think the stock market is already showing signs of a leadership shift away from slow economic growth favorites including growth, tech, and defensive toward more the economically sensitive areas of small caps and cyclical sectors,” he added.
*****
> # Supply chain, higher cost warnings?
While the earnings season should be strong, there are likely to be some warning signs about inflation and supply constraints that could scare the market about the year-end set-up.
*****
> “The risks of higher inflation, Fed tapering and what will likely be a choppy earnings season are still with us,” Bleakley Advisory Group chief investment officer Peter Boockvar said.
*****
> There was some foreshadowing of this last week, when Bed Bath and Beyond shares cratered 25% after the company said it saw a steep drop-off in traffic in August. Bed Bath & Beyond saw inflation costs escalating over the summer months, especially toward the end of its second quarter in August, which corroded profits.
*****
> What investors know going into the third quarter — from company guidance — is that there could be haves and have nots this earnings season.
*****
> FactSet data shows that 47 S&P 500 companies have issued negative earnings guidance for the third quarter, and 56 companies have issued positive outlooks.
*****
> # Fed headwind ahead?
> The headline jobs number Friday was a major disappointment, as the economy added just 194,000 jobs in September, well below the the Dow Jones estimate of 500,000. On the positive side, the unemployment rate fell to a much lower point than economists forecast. At 4.8%, that’s the same level seen in late 2016.
*****
> It’s unclear if the number changes the calculus for when and how fast the Federal Reserve will slow its $120 billion-per-month bond-buying program.
*****
> “In our view these figures are good enough, and when combined with the debt-ceiling can being kicked down the road, likely solidifies November as ‘go time’ for tapering,” Wells Fargo Securities senior equity analyst Christopher Harvey said.
*****
> “We continue to expect a choppy equity market rally and a two-to-four-week tech bounce, but the bounce probably peters out next month when the Fed says those magical words: We will begin to taper,” he added.

> # Best and Worst Performing S&P 500 Stocks in 2021

> The fourth quarter is now off to the races and we thought it worthwhile to check in on the best and worst-performing S&P 500 stocks on a year-to-date basis. As shown below, there are currently six members of the index that have rallied over 100% this year. Apt for the year that its vaccine has rolled out, the biggest gainer of these has been Moderna (MRNA) with a 196.12% rally. It now has a market cap of $124.87 billion versus a market cap of only $41 billion at the start of the year. Of the 20 best performers, MRNA is also the only one with a market cap above $100 billion. The next largest is ConocoPhillips (COP) with a $95.76 billion market cap. COP is one of multiple Energy stocks on this list as well. Of the top 20 performers, Energy sector names dominate the list with 8 members.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/100821-SPX-1.png))**

> Pivoting to the other end of the spectrum, Las Vegas Sands (LVS) is down the most this year having been cut by 36.18%. IPG Photonics (IPGP), Lamb Weston Holdings (LW), Viatris (VTRS), MarketAxess (MKTX), and Global Payments (GPN) also have fallen by at least 25%. Once again, there is only one member of this list with a market cap above $100 billion: Qualcomm (QCOM). One other interesting factor to note of the worst performers is there are several stocks that were at some point plays on pandemic trends, whether those be reopening or stay at home. For example, in addition to LVS, another gaming/reopening name, Wynn Resorts (WYNN), ranks as the eighth-worst performer YTD. Additionally, strong performers during the onset of the pandemic like Clorox (CLX), Activision Blizzard (ATVI), and Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) are all down double digits this year.

> # Intraday Commodity Spikes

> Since the late spring, both silver and gold have been in steady downtrends spending much of that time below their 50-DMAs. Those downtrends remain in place, but both metals did find a short-term bottom on September 29th. While they have been rallying in the past week and a half, today each one has stalled out. From the early morning leading up to the Nonfarm Payrolls report, precious metals ramped higher with a surge immediately following the weaker than expected report. Only a couple hours after the release, gold and silver had erased a large portion of their earlier gains. In fact, silver is now 2.15% below its intraday high and gold is 1.36% below its high. For gold, in particular, that intraday reversal also marked a rejection of its 50-DMA which it—as well as silver—has struggled to stay above for most of the past several months.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/100821-GC-SI.png))**

> Crude oil is yet another commodity that is currently down off of its intraday highs, and like gold, the reversal came at a pretty interesting level. At its high Friday morning, front-month WTI futures rose above $80 for the first time since November 2014.

> # The Job Market Continues To Frustrate In September

> The September payroll report likely created more questions than it answered.

> The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics released its September employment report this morning, revealing that the domestic economy added a disappointing 194,000 jobs during the month, falling well short of Bloomberg-surveyed economists’ median forecast for a gain of 500,000. This comes on the heels of a lukewarm August report, which did receive an upward revision of 131,000. Somewhat contradictory, the unemployment rate fell more than forecast to 4.8% in September, beating expectations, though that was paired with a reduced labor force participation rate of 61.6% when expectations called for an increase.

> “The observation window for this report likely came too soon for positive catalysts to really gain traction,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Leisure and hospitality jobs, a proxy for economic reopening, were only marginally higher. We take this to mean Delta’s waning impact will likely be more evident in October’s report where we expect to see reopening momentum reassert itself.”

> As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, in-person segments of the labor market such as leisure and hospitality jobs grew steadily during the first half of the year when COVID-19 remained under relative control. However, the latest flare-up has dampened that trend. We expect to see renewed growth in this sector as the delta variant continues to abate.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.8.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> As mentioned, definitive takeaways from this report are difficult to come by due to the offsetting nature of the report. On the one hand, headline numbers came in very weak, but private payrolls, as well as manufacturing payrolls, fared better. The unemployment rate experienced a significant drop, but interpreting that number becomes muddied when considering the fact that we are already experiencing a significant worker shortage and the participation rate is declining, not increasing, as we would hope to see in a true recovery.

> What is more, because the observation window for the report cuts off mid-month, we cannot yet draw conclusions about the impact of school reopening and the lapsing of enhanced unemployment benefits—hotly debated crosscurrents—plus the aforementioned waning delta impact. Regarding the inflation debate—average hourly earnings rose 0.6% month over month and 4.6% year over year. And while wages are undeniably growing and helping to fuel inflation, the data are not mix-adjusted and therefore are inflated due to the suppressed growth in the in-person, lower-wage segment of the labor market.

> The biggest question, though, is what this means for the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) asset tapering plans. The market had all but expected the Fed to announce a tapering timeline at its next meeting coming into this report, with the caveat that Fed Chair Jerome Powell needed only to see a “reasonably good” job report first. Whether September’s surprise report has cleared that low bar or not now becomes an open question, one which the market had all but dismissed as a formality previously.

> Indeed, in the aftermath of the report’s release Treasury markets immediately began pricing in a possible delay to any taper, and equity markets gyrated between positive and negative territory as they struggled to process whether bad news should actually be considered good news in this context. We will have to see in the coming weeks whether this report will be substantial enough to bring on the much-anticipated taper announcement, but one thing is for sure—there are no gimmies in this labor market recovery.

> # Columbus Day Performance

> Columbus Day is an interesting trading day for financial markets as it is one of the few trading days of the year when the equity market is open, but the bond market is closed. This may lead investors to think that equity markets should perform positively, as investors do not have credit markets to allocate capital to on that specific day. However, looking at the S&P 500's historical performance on Columbus Day over the last 25 years doesn't necessarily show a real positive bias. Columbus Day tends to act just like any other trading day. Over the last 25 years, median performance on Columbus Day has been a gain of 10 basis points (bps) with positive returns 55.6% of the time. While that's slightly higher than the median one-day gain of 7 bps for all trading days over the last 25 years, the difference isn't significant. That's not to say that Columbus Day hasn't seen some outliers, though. Who can forget in 2008, during the middle of the Financial Crisis, when the S&P 500 rallied more than 11% on Columbus Day!

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/Day-of.png))**

> For the week of Columbus Day, the S&P 500's median gain has been 0.31% with positive returns 63% of the time which also isn't extraordinary relative to average weekly returns for the S&P 500 over the last 25 years. The worst Columbus Day weeks were in 1999 (-6.63%) and 2018 (-4.10%) while the best were in 1998 (+7.32%), 2002 (5.87%), and 2011 (+5.98%). Interestingly enough, in 2008, even after rallying over 11% on Columbus Day, the S&P 500 finished the week up just 4.60% as it erased more than half of its gains from the holiday session.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/Week-of.png))**

> The table below lists the S&P 500's performance leading up to and after Columbus Day for each of the last 25 years. With a decline of over 2.5% since the start of September, this year ranks as the weakest performance for the equity market since 2014.

> # The Most Important Chart In The World

> And just like that, the calendar turned to October and volatility picked up in a big way, with three consecutive 1% moves for the S&P 500 Index to start the month. As we noted in our October preview, this month gets a bad rap for being a bearish month (it isn’t), but it absolutely owns the title as the most volatile month.

> t took nearly a full year, but the S&P 500 finally had its first 5% pullback of 2021, thus ending hopes of 2021 joining 1954, 1958, 1964, 1993, 1995, and 2017 as the only years to go a full calendar year without a 5% move lower.

> “Volatility is the price of admission,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Sure, we’d all prefer stocks go straight up forever, but that isn’t reality. Investors must learn to embrace and accept the eventual scares and bouts of volatility that are common even in the strongest bull markets.”

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, since 1980, stocks experience a 14.2% peak-to-trough pullback on average during the year, putting the recent 5% pullback in perspective. In fact, 21 out of the past 41 years saw at least a 10% correction. Incredibly, 12 of those years finished in the green and those 12 years gained an average of 17.0%. Who could forget last year’s 34% bear market and move back to up 16% by the end of the year? In other words, big pullbacks can happen even in years that see outsized gains, which is why this chart is so important for investors.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.6.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> The last new all-time high for the S&P 500 was on September 2, but as of the end of September there were still 54 new all-time highs in 2021, the second most ever with one quarter to go. The good news? Previous years that saw a lot new highs the first three quarters usually had strong performance the final quarter.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.6.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

> Taking things a step further, this year the S&P 500 produced one of its best ever year-to-date gains through September, up 14.7% with a quarter to go. It turns out that good starts to a year tend to resolve higher. In fact, 9 of the past 10 years the S&P 500 was up at least 12.5% with a quarter to go there were further gains in the fourth quarter. As you can see below, the returns are greatly skewed due to 1987, but the median return in the final quarter of the year is an impressive 5.2% (versus the average fourth quarter return of 4.0%).

> # Performance Through Q3 And its Impact on Q4 Performance

> Every year, the makeup and number of sectors that outperform the S&P 500 changes. This year, four sectors (Energy, Financials, Real Estate, and Communication Services) outperformed the S&P 500 through the end of Q3, while last year it was only three sectors that outperformed in the first three quarters of the year (Technology, Consumer Discretionary, and Communication Services).

> As we all know, past performance does not indicate future performance, and in looking at sectors that have outperformed the S&P 500 in the first three quarters of prior years compared to how they performed in Q4, the same holds true. The table below lists the number of sectors that outperformed and underperformed the S&P 500 in the first three quarters of each year since 2000 and then shows their median performance during Q4 of the same year. Looking at a summary of the annual results, it's almost a coinflip as to whether or not the leading sectors in the first three quarters of a given year will continue to outperform in Q4. On average, the sectors that outperform YTD through 9/30 have averaged a Q4 gain of 3.58% (median: +6.40%) with positive returns 76% of the time. Sectors that lag the S&P 500 in the first three quarters of the year average a rest of year gain of 3.67% (median: 5.95%) with gains 71% of the time. While the term 'strength begets strength' has historically been applicable to the broader market, at the sector level, buying the YTD winners (or losers) ahead of Q4 in expectation of continued momentum to close out the year (or a mean reversion bounce) hasn't offered any material outperformance.

> # Typical October Trading: Volatile Start Sets Up Rally through Month’s End

> Over the last twenty-one years, the full month of October has been a solid month for the market. DJIA, S&P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 have all recorded gains ranging from 0.6% by Russell 2000 to 1.9% by NASDAQ. But these gains have come with volatile trading, most notably during the early days of the month. October has opened softly with mild gains on its first trading day by DJIA, S&P 500 and Russell 1000. On the second day, all five indexes have been weak followed by a rebound on the third trading day before additional weakness pulls the market lower through the seventh trading day. At which point, the market has historically found support and began to rally through mid-month and beyond.

  * What’s happening this morning? It was another quiet night of news. Stocks in Asia were
mixed (Japan, Taiwan, and Australia saw pressure while mainland China and HK did well) but
Eurozone equities are trading lower across the board (and US futures are down small).
There were no major headlines in the last 12-18 hours, neither on the macro nor micro
fronts. Treasury yields rose Mon but are reversing that entire move so far Tues. Crude
spiked Mon morning on the Qatar news before bleeding lower throughout the day amid
worries the rift could imperil the OPEC/Russia production deal (oil is flat-to-down small so
far Tues morning; there are some indications that countries like Kuwait are working to
mediate the Qatar diplomatic crisis). Europe is being led lower by basic resources,
chemicals, retail, and healthcare (Roche is a big laggard in the last category on back of
downbeat data; in general ASCO hasn’t been kind to large caps w/BMY getting hit Mon due
to news out of the conf.). The week’s big events are coming up on Thurs (ECB, Comey, UK
election).
  * Calendar for Tues June 6 – the focus will be on Emperor Coffeve’s meeting w/Congressional GOP
leaders (the focus is on jumpstarting Emperor Coffeve’s legislative agenda), the US JOLTs report for
Apr (10amET), some analyst meetings (M, MDP, and PRU), earnings (CONN, CSIQ, FRAN,
FRED, HDS, LE, MIK, and SCWX pre-open and AMBA, HQY, KEYS, OXM, PLAY, SEAC, and
UNFI after the close), and a slew of conferences.
  * Europe – the major indices are trading down ~30bp. Autos, basic resources, chemicals,
media, retail, and healthcare are leading on the downside while staples, real estate, energy,
and utilities are outperforming. Lufthansa is rallying following pos. remarks from the
company while Roche is getting hit on underwhelming data. The EUR isn’t doing a whole
lot.
  * Asia – the major indices in Asia saw mixed price action overnight: Japan (TPX -0.84%, NKY -
0.95%), HK (Hang Seng +0.52%, HSCEI +0.09%), mainland China (SHCOMP +0.34%, Shenzhen
+0.55%, CSI 300 +0.7%), Taiwan (TAIEX -0.2%), Australia (ASX 200 -1.52%), and India (down
~35-40bp). South Korea was closed. There weren’t too many major headlines out of the
region. In Japan all the major sub-groups saw pressure; healthcare, telecoms, utilities, and
industrials fell the most. Toshiba rallied after media reports pointed (again) to a potential
AVGO bid for the memory unit. HK/China outperformed the rest of Asia; within the Hang
Seng top groups included real estate, tech, and industrials while discretionary, energy, and
staples lagged.

#Top Headlines for Tuesday

  * Economic data/monetary policy headlines for Tues 6/6. It was generally a slow morning.
Eurozone retail sales came in a touch light for Apr at +0.1% M/M vs. the St +0.2%. The RBA
left rates unchanged, as expected (http://bit.ly/2r0MBZS). JPMorgan is trimming Q1
Australian GDP estimates following weak net trade and gov’t spending data
(http://bit.ly/2qSDYkS). Japanese Apr wage inflation data points to some firming
(http://bit.ly/2rZw7pX).
  * Washington update – all the media wants to talk about is Russia/Comey, all Emperor Coffeve wants to
talk about (for this week) is infrastructure, and the market couldn’t care less about either
issue. Political expectations have been subdued for weeks and this is helping insulate stocks
from all the Washington-linked noise. Curiosity and a relatively barren calendar will have
eyes glued to Comey on Thurs but this isn’t likely to be a market-moving event. Meanwhile
all the infrastructure-related noise is considered by most to be just that (empty rhetoric w/o
a chance of passing into law) and actually could be counterproductive (to the extent it
places yet another burden on Congress at a time when its agenda is already very full). From
the perspective of the SPX the focus right now is on the debt ceiling, the F18 budget, and
Emperor Coffeve’s Fed nominees. Investors are reasonable confident in Washington avoiding a debt
 ceiling debacle and shutdown (although the latter issue may require a few CRs before a final
agreement is reached). Taxes are still important but at this point simply getting the
corporate rate and repatriation rate to <28% and 8-10%, respectively, by the end of CQ1:18
would be considered a victory.
   * Emperor Coffeve to meet w/Congressional GOP leaders on Tues 6/6 in a bid to jumpstart his
agenda; White House wants healthcare vote this summer, tax reform in fall –
Reuters http://reut.rs/2rwmoWP
   * Republicans increasingly concerned that Emperor Coffeve’s behavior (and tweeting) is
increasingly placing their agenda in peril – Washington Post.
http://wapo.st/2rORPfF
   * Taxes - House Republican leaders’ controversial border adjustment tax is dead, and
as a result, their plans to dramatically overhaul the tax code could soon be too – Roll
Call http://bit.ly/2rwgsgr
   * Healthcare – Senate Republicans are pushing forward on healthcare w/the
leadership keen to have a vote by the Jul 4 recess even if the measure doesn’t have
enough support to pass. Senate Republicans will meet Tues to discuss the issue.
McConnell doesn’t want healthcare dominating the rest of the year and thinks a
vote soon will help provide clarity (either enough support exists or it doesn’t and
the GOP moves on to other items). At this point it doesn’t look like 50 votes exist.
Politico. http://politi.co/2rYgQ90
   * Emperor Coffeve turns on his AG – Emperor Coffeve is said to be souring on AG Sessions, upset over the
stalled travel ban and particularly incensed about Sessions having recused himself
from the various Russia probes. Emperor Coffeve doesn’t think a special counsel would have
been appointed if Sessions hadn’t recused himself. NYT. http://nyti.ms/2sMkb7m
   * Emperor Coffeve to launch new America-themed hotel chain – the Emperor Coffeve Organization will
launch a new lower-end hotel chain dubbed “American Idea” that it hopes will
appeal to budget-conscious patriots; the first locations will open in little-known
towns in Mississippi (a state that went for Emperor Coffeve by 18 points over Clinton) and
should come online quickly as the initiative will involve rebranding existing Holiday
Inns and Comfort Inns – NYT http://nyti.ms/2ruCUGG
  * Economic conditions aren’t very different from 2016 (when the Fed kept policy on hold for
most of the year) but financial conditions are much healthier today and that is giving the
FOMC comfort to proceed w/additional hiking – FT http://on.ft.com/2rN84cR
  * US and Mexico close to a sugar deal – Wilbur Ross said the two countries are nearing an
agreement around sugar; the Mon deadline has been pushed back 24 hours to allow for
additional negotiations. WSJ. http://on.wsj.com/2sx7Ep9
  * Oil output set to rise in 2018 regardless of the OPEC/Russia agreement (and there are
some compliance concerns w/regards to that pact). Marketwatch has a cautious oil article
noting that output looks set to rise despite the recent Russia/OPEC agreement. Meanwhile
there are signs that compliance w/the pact could be weakening at the margin.
http://on.mktw.net/2rXMXFU
  * Qatar – Kuwait is mediating the recent rift between Qatar and some of its Middle Eastern
neighbors; Qatar hopes Kuwait will be able to reduce some of the friction – Reuters
http://reut.rs/2rZ4PA0
  * Qatar – the $1B ransom payment to al Qaeda affiliates and Iran was “the straw that broke
the camel’s back” – a group of Qatari royals were kidnapped in Iraq while on a hunting trip
and the gov’t paid $1B in ransom to get them back. That payment, to groups affiliated
w/terrorist organizations and the Iran, caused Qatar’s Gulf neighbors (and Egypt) to sever
diplomatic ties. FT http://on.ft.com/2qUXTnA
  * China/climate change – China is looking to capitalize on its lead in solar and wind energy as
the Emperor Coffeve administration ostensibly deemphasizes renewables; Beijing wants to help other
countries meet their climate goals – NYT http://nyti.ms/2sN3PLH
  * Active managers are beginning to beat the market (although not in a particularly
encouraging fashion) – the WSJ notes that active performance has improved of late
although this seems to simply be a function of managers overweighting a handful of
momentum stocks. WSJ http://on.wsj.com/2sxfSNT
   

#Company-specific news update for Mon night. 

 
 * In general it was a slow night of headlines although a few items were in focus. J. Crew announced a mgmt. transition that will see Mickey Drexler give up his CEO role to West Elm’s James Brett (Drexler will remain
chairman); http://on.wsj.com/2rMrK0z. PRGO also said its CEO will be stepping down (the
co has created a search committee to find a successor). MCHP raised its June Q guidance;
the co now sees revs at the mid-point of the range rising 5.25% Q/Q (vs. the prior mid-point
+4.5%) and EPS will come in 1.22-1.26 (vs. the prior 1.17-1.27); http://bit.ly/2rMXRgO. CASY
shares slumped in after-hours trading after earnings came in light of expectations while THO
rallied on back of better results. RAD put out an update on the WBA deal, stating that the
FTC’s longer than expected review of the merger has left a negative impact on the
company’s results. SIG shares fell after the close after announcing the departure of its COO
for violations of company policy “unrelated to financial matters”. CSX’s CEO reassured
shareholders during the co’s shareholder meeting on Mon that he would be able to lead the
turnaround despite requiring supplemental oxygen for an undisclosed medical condition
(http://on.wsj.com/2sKPjUR). Sony made pos. comments on PS4 sales and says robust
Nintendo Switch trends aren’t subtracting from PlayStation’s momentum
(http://on.ft.com/2qURKYt). According to Bloomberg, Sprint/S and TMUS are considering
an all-stock option as they proceed w/merger talks (https://bloom.bg/2r0RwtR). WDC is
offering concessions to Toshiba in a bid to strike a semi deal and avoid the unit being sold to
a 3rd party (http://s.nikkei.com/2qUQrZz). SFR will purchase a portfolio of single family
rental homes for $815M funded by a subsequently announced equity offering.
 
 * Toshiba/AVGO – Toshiba shares rallied Tues after the Asahi newspaper reported
that it is considering giving AVGO exclusive rights to negotiate a purchase of the
memory unit. Reuters http://reut.rs/2qWyMRp
 * AMZN targets core WMT customer segment – AMZN is launching a new Prime
membership price aimed at lower-income Americans receiving government
assistance (the new rate is $5.99/month). WMT captured ~18% of all money spent
through the SNAP program last year (about ~$13B in revs) and AMZN is attacking
that market. WSJ. http://on.wsj.com/2rGgNf0
 * AAPL recap – the WWDC was largely as expected and didn’t contain any surprises
(AAPL shares opened in the red on back of a d/g Mon morning and stayed at those
levels throughout the entire session – there wasn’t any major movement around
the Tim Cook keynote which started at 1pmET). The HomePod was marketed more
as a music device (i.e. a Sonos competitor) instead of a broader home assistant (it
will do all the home assisting tasks via Siri but the device contains high-end audio
specifications absent from AMZN Echo and others); the one criticism that most had
w/the product was its price ($349). The whole MacBook lineup received a refresh
(as expected). The main purpose of the WWDC are Apple’s various operation
systems and they were a central piece of the Mon keynote (some of the highlights:
Apple introduced a Venmo money transfer competitor for iOS along w/a GDOTbacked
debit card and announced that Amazon TV will be coming to tvOS).


#Calendar of events to watch for the week of Mon June 5
 
  * Calendar for Wed June 7 – the focus will be on China’s FX reserve numbers for May (Tues
night/Wed morning), German factory orders for Apr (2amET), the India RBI decision
(5amET), US consumer credit for Apr (3pmET), analyst meetings (RJF, TAP, and WCC),
earnings (BF’b pre-open and TLRD, VRNT after the close), and a slew of conferences.
  * Calendar for Thurs June 8 – the focus will be on China’s May imports/exports (Wed
night/Thurs morning), German industrial production for Apr (2amET), the UK election, the
ECB decision (7:45amET statement and 8:30amET press conf.), Comey’s testimony before
the Senate Intelligence panel, analyst meetings (AZPN and SYMC), earnings (Dell, SJM preopen
and CLDR, Hudson’s Bay, and PAY after the close), and conference presentations.
   * ECB decision – the language around growth will likely turn more sanguine and the
balance of risks could approach “balanced”. However, Draghi will likely strongly
qualify any growth optimism with ongoing inflation caution (recall the most recent
Eurozone CPI for May, out 5/31, fell short of expectations). The promise to enhance
monetary accommodation even further may be dropped although the text isn’t
likely to threaten earlier tightening. The language around asset purchases, rates,
and policy sequencing will probably stay unchanged (the market would welcome a
return of the deposit rate to 0% given the headwind this represents for banks
although the ECB will likely be averse to take this step as it could be misconstrued as
premature tightening by the market).
   * UK election - May/Tory Party poll numbers have softened over the last few weeks
and the latest readings suggest the conservatives will fall short of an outright
parliamentary majority (~305-310 for the Tories, ~260 for labor, and ~80 for other
parties).
  * Calendar for Fri June 9 – the focus will be on China’s May CPI/PPI (Thurs night/Fri morning),
German imports/exports for Apr (2amET), and the US wholesale inventories/trade
numbers for Apr (10amET).

"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning September 6th, 2021",58,phgmrc,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/phgmrc/wall_street_week_ahead_for_the_trading_week/,22,2021-09-04 05:16:40,"Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning September 6th, 2021.

# **Stocks could look right past the weak jobs report and focus on strong profits - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/03/stocks-could-look-right-past-the-weak-jobs-report-to-another-strong-earnings-season.html)**
*****
> After a weak jobs report, strategists say investor focus may stay on strong profit growth rather than other potential negatives.
*****
> Stocks were mixed in the past week ahead of the long Labor Day weekend, with the Nasdaq outperforming, the S&P 500 rising slightly and the Dow flat. The best-performing sectors were on the defensive side, led by real estate investment trusts, utilities, consumer staples and health care.
*****
> “You’ve got this Labor Day effect. People are back from vacation” in the coming week, National Securities chief market strategist Art Hogan said.
*****
> Hogan said investors expect the trading activity to pick up as a result, but it typically remains slow in the holiday shortened-week. Investors may assess their summer performance and move to lock in gains or add hedges.
*****
> “If you look back at the last five post-Labor Day weeks that have happened with the market near all-time highs, the post Labor Day week is the worst for September,” Hogan said.
*****
> # Year-to-date returns
*****
> https://i.imgur.com/I2dgbkQ.png
*****
> Friday’s disappointing August jobs report — with just 235,000 jobs added — was a dampener for sentiment, but stocks were mixed.
*****
> “My outlook for the last several weeks is sideways to moderately higher, and that seems where they’re headed. There isn’t a lot of bearish data accumulating. At worst we go sideways,” said Randy Frederick, Charles Schwab managing director of trading and derivatives.
*****
> Frederick said even with worries about the weaker jobs and Covid,-19 investors may continue to focus on profits. Economists blamed the spread of the Covid delta variant for the weaker than expected jobs report.
*****
> Strategists say other issues for stocks in September could include the efforts in Congress to pass infrastructure legislation and possible new taxes.
*****
> # Ignoring jobs report
*****
> Frederick said he expects the market to look beyond the August employment report, which was about 500,000 lower than expected.
*****
> “I don’t think there’s spillover much into next week for the most part,” he added. “The markets are down a little bit, but I think they’ve taken it in stride better than might be expected.”
*****
> Weekly jobless claims data Thursday could be even more important than usual because of the big miss in August’s employment report. Jobs data is important because that is one area where Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said he would like to see more improvement before the central bank can decide to slow its bond purchases.
*****
> The market has been fixated on the Fed’s move to end its $120 billion a month bond-buying program because it is viewed as a precursor to interest rate hikes. However, Powell has stressed the two are not linked.
*****
> “If feels like [the jobs report] pushes the announcement of a taper to the November meeting, rather than the September meeting, and for the most part that was consensus,” Hogan said.
*****
> Hogan said the market will also be watching any inflation-related data, so that makes Fridays’ producer price index important after it surged last month. The consumer price index, released the following week, will be even more important for the market.
*****
> NatWest Markets head of macro strategy John Briggs said the markets will be watching for any Fed-related headlines after the disappointing employment report.
*****
> “Next week, you have [New York Fed President John] Williams speaking. His take will be important. He’s viewed as being close to Powell,” Briggs said. Williams is set to speak Wednesday at a briefing on the economy.
*****
> # What’s next for stocks
*****
> Besides the Fed, the next big event for stocks will be the third-quarter earnings season, which gets underway in early October. Before that, investors will be watching for any company comments on results.
*****
> Frederick said the strength of earnings has been propelling stocks and could keep doing so. ″The market was so overvalued for awhile until earnings caught up, but earnings were spectacular and now the valuations aren’t as high as they were a few months ago, so we can do this,” he said.
*****
> Earnings are expected to increase by 29.8% for the third quarter after the second quarter’s stunning 95.6% increase, according to Refinitiv.
*****
> “There’s a vacuum of earnings related news,” Frederick said, noting the market could be influenced by geopolitical events in the meantime.
*****
> But even if the market loses steam, he doesn’t expect a major sell-off because for now, dip buyers continue to come in whenever the market has a setback.
*****
> The S&P 500 ended the week up 0.6% at 4,535, versus a 1.5% move higher by the Nasdaq to 15,363, a new high. The Dow was flattish, off 0.2%, at 35,369.
*****
> The closely watched 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.32% late Friday, just above where it was a week ago.

> # Weakness Day After Labor Day & Sell Rosh Hashanah

> In the last 21 years, only Russell 2000 has registered an average gain of 0.04% on the Tuesday after the long Labor Day weekend. DJIA, S&P 500 and NASDAQ have struggled with negative average performance. NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have been up five of the last nine years, but DJIA, S&P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 all have fallen for the last four years on Tuesday. On Wednesday the market’s performance has been varied. DJIA has performed the best, up 76.2% of the time with an average gain of 0.33%. S&P 500 is worst, up only 47.6% of the time with an average gain of 0.25%. NASDAQ has a better record up 52.4% of the time on Wednesday, but a smaller average gain of 0.14%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/6a21f54090531d6af040908d26933cf6/3527e5164e79635b-f2/s500x750/6a6618593a7e03b8f169df02f72c6a0a63c53430.jpg))**

> **Sell Rosh Hashanah, Buy Yom Kippur**

> As the High Holidays approach you may remember the old saying on the Street, “Sell Rosh Hashanah, Buy Yom Kippur.” It gets tossed around every autumn when the “high holidays” are on the minds of traders as many of their Jewish colleagues take off to observe the Jewish New Year and Day of Atonement.

> The basis for this, “Sell Rosh Hashanah, Buy Yom Kippur,” pattern is that with many traders and investors busy with religious observance and family, positions are closed out and volume fades creating a buying vacuum. Even in the age of algorithmic, computer, and high frequency trading these seasonal patterns persist as humans still need to turn the machines on and off and feed them money or take it away – and these algorithms and trading programs are written by people so the human influence is still there.

> Holiday seasonality around official market holidays is something we pay close attention to (page 98 Stock Trader’s Almanac 2021). Actual stats on the most observed Hebrew holidays have been compiled in the table here. We present the data back to 1971 and when the holiday falls on a weekend the prior market close is used. It’s no coincidence that Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur fall in September and/or October, two dangerous and sometimes opportune months.

> Perhaps it’s Talmudic wisdom but, selling stocks before the eight-day span of the high holidays has avoided many declines, especially during uncertain times. While being long Yom Kippur to Passover has produced 64% more advances, half as many losses and average gains of 7.0%. This past year DJIA gained 19.9% from Yom Kippur 2020 to Passover 2021.

> This year the high holidays arrive early on Labor Day eve, September 6, and end Thursday September 16 with Yom Kippur at mid-month one of the strongest days September. But with the market in full rally mode on easy Federal Reserve money and free Federal Government fiscal stimulus month selling ahead of the Jewish High Holidays could trigger a mild correction of 5% or so. The end of September after Triple Witching is notoriously the weakest part of the month, so it may be more prudent to “buy” later in the month.

> # Here Comes the Worst Month of the Year

> The incredible bull market continues, with the S&P 500 Index up to a record 53 new all-time highs before August is over, topping the previous record from 1964.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8.31.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> “Although this bull market has laughed at nearly all the worry signs in 2021, let’s not forget that September is historically the worst month of the year for stocks,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Even last year, in the face of a huge rally off the March 2020 lows, we saw a nearly 10% correction in the middle of September.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8.31.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

> The S&P 500 hasn’t had so much as a 5% correction since last October and with stocks up more than 100% since March 2020, investors should be open to some potential seasonal weakness. The good news is we remain in the camp that stocks will continue to go higher and investors should use any weakness as an opportunity to add to core equity holdings.

> Let’s be honest, stocks can’t go up forever. In fact, the S&P 500 is about to be up 7 months in a row, one of the longest monthly win streaks ever.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8.31.21-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**

> It is what happens next that has our attention. As the LPL Chart of the Day shows, after 7-month win streaks, the S&P 500 has been higher six months later 13 out of 14 times, with a very impressive 7.8% average return. This reinforces our belief that in the event of a well-deserved pullback, it would be an opportunity to buy at cheaper prices.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8.31.21-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**

> With a very highly anticipated Federal Reserve Bank meeting in September, along with continued Delta variant worries, coupled with the fact that stocks haven’t pulled back in a long time, investors should be on the lookout for some seasonal volatility in September. We remain in the camp that any weakness, should it occur, could be short-term and likely be contained in the 5-8% range. This bull market is alive and well and we would view any potential weakness as an opportunity.

> # August Payrolls Disappoint

> It seems to be two steps forward, one step back for the U.S. labor market.

> The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics released its August employment report this morning, revealing that the domestic economy added a disappointing 235,000 jobs during the month, falling well short of Bloomberg-surveyed economists’ median forecast for a gain of 733,000. This comes on the heels of a strong July during which payrolls climbed by an upwardly revised 1.053 million jobs. The unemployment rate fell to 5.2% in August, in line with expectations, and was paired with an unchanged labor force participation rate, which stayed at 61.7%.

> “The Delta variant surge is the unsurprising story behind August’s big payroll miss,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Leisure and hospitality jobs, a proxy for economic reopening, were flat month over month. The good news is that we see promising signs Delta’s effect will wane in coming months and payrolls will resume growing at a fast clip.”

> As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, we remain 5.3 million payrolls shy of February 2020’s peak.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/9.3.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

> The other key takeaway from this report is wage pressures are building. Average hourly earnings came in hotter than expected, an increasingly common occurrence, posting a 0.6% month-over-month gain versus expectations for 0.3%, and a 4.3% gain year over year versus expectations for 3.9%. Wages have important implications in the inflation debate, as they and rents are considered to be among the “stickier” components of inflation. Today’s report is likely to bolster those in the camp asserting inflation will be less transitory than the Federal Reserve (Fed) thinks, though it should be noted that the lack of employment growth in lower wage in-person sectors likely contributed to the higher wage numbers.

> Looking ahead, we continue to believe there is reason to expect a strong jobs rebound in coming months. Schools closed for the summer, potential disincentives from enhanced unemployment benefits, and the troublesome Delta variant have all acted as speed limits on the pace of employment growth recently. August’s report, though, figures to be the last where all of these factors remain in full force. Enhanced unemployment benefits are set to expire on Labor Day (ironically), meaning their effects will only be present for part of the September report’s observation window, and will be fully gone by the October report. Schools and daycare facilities, meanwhile, are beginning to reopen, freeing up parents to rejoin the labor force. And, most importantly, we are seeing promising signs that the worst of the latest flare-up in COVID-19 cases may be behind us.

> Zooming out, this job report has the potential to delay the Fed’s tapering timeline. Fed Chair Powell has made it clear that the labor market will serve as his tell regarding when to begin tapering asset purchases. With today’s big payroll miss, it is clear the labor market is under some near term pressure, and while these pressures are likely to dissipate the Fed will probably err on the side of caution to avoid acting prematurely. The next month is sure to be an interesting one for Fed-watchers.

> # Bullish Sentiment Finally Rises in Back to Back Weeks

> The S&P 500 has continued to press higher resulting in a coincident rise in sentiment. The AAII's weekly reading on bullish sentiment rose back above 40% for the first time since the week of July 8th. While 43.4% is not a particularly elevated reading on sentiment (72nd percentile of all periods), the move higher is particularly notable in that it was the first time bullish sentiment has risen in back-to-back weeks since February. That is especially surprising given the fact that bullish sentiment was very elevated at points between now and then, such as back in the spring when it eclipsed 50%. That is also a historically long stretch of time without back-to-back increases in bullish sentiment. As shown in the second chart below, at just over half of a year-long, the only two similar streaks on record were in 1995 and from 1997 to 1998.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/090221-AAII-Bull.png))**

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/090221-AAII-Bull-Back-to-Back.png))**

> Negative sentiment has broadly picked up over the past couple of months. In the AAII survey, bearish sentiment was slightly higher at 33.3% versus 33% last week. While below the peak from only a couple of weeks ago, that is still elevated versus readings from earlier this year.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/090221-AAII-Bear.png))**

> Similarly, the Investors Intelligence survey of newsletter writers has also seen bearish sentiment on the rise throughout the summer. This week, it topped 20% for the first time since March 10th. At 21.3%, bearish sentiment in this survey is at the highest level since last October. With that said, the current reading is also well below the 20 year average of 24.19%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/090221-II-Bear.png))**

> As a result of the larger gains to bullish versus bearish sentiment, optimism remains the favored response in the AAII survey. The bull-bear spread rose back into positive double digits this week for the first time since the last week of July.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/090221-AAII-Bull-Bear-Spread.png))**

> Given both bullish and bearish sentiments were higher, neutral sentiment has continued to unwind. That reading fell 4.3 percentage points this week to a new low of 23.2%. That was the fourth decline in the past five weeks as neutral sentiment came in at the lowest level since mid-April.

> # Emerging Markets Leave China Behind

> In last night's Closer, we noted the record underperformance of Chinese equities relative to the US over the past six months. As a result of the weakness in Chinese equities, the MSCI Emerging Market ETF (EEM)—which has roughly a 37% weight in Hong Kong and Chinese stocks—is well off of its highs and has been trending lower over the past several months. Today, EEM is up a healthy 1.37%, but that brings it just short of its 50-DMA which recently fell below its 200-DMA. That is also at similar levels to the lower high from the start of this month.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/083121-EEM.png))**

> When factoring out China, emerging markets look much better. Again, the MSCI Emerging Market ETF that excludes China (EMXC) is currently 1.13% below its 52-week high, but the downtrend that has been in place since the early June highs has been on the ropes over the past couple of sessions. Yesterday saw the ETF trade and close right at that downtrend line, but the 1.15% gain today has smashed through it. That leaves EMXC at the highest level since June 15th. The ETF is also at some of the most overbought levels (1.8 standard deviations from its 50-DMA) since then.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/083121-EMXC.png))**

> Pivoting over to bonds, looking at the Fixed Income screen of our Trend Analyzer, the best performer over the past five days is also in the EM space. The USD Emerging Markets Bond ETF (EMB) had been mostly flat throughout the summer trending right alongside its sideways 50- and 200-DMAs. Significant gains last Friday and yesterday led EMB to break out of that range as it reaches some of the highest levels since February today.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/083121-EMB.png))**

> As previously mentioned, EMB has not ventured far from its 50-DMA recently. In fact, the rolling 50-day standard deviation has been right around some of the lowest levels on record since EMB began trading in 2008. Given that lack of volatility, the rip higher this week has resulted in the ETF moving well beyond the upper end of its narrow trading range. In fact, yesterday the ETF closed over 3 standard deviations above its 50-DMA. That joins only 14 other days where the ETF closed at least 3 standard deviations above its 50-DMA with the most recent of those back in June 2019 when it reached as high as 4 standard deviations above its moving average.

#Trading Update

• Market update – from the perspective of US equities, it was a quiet weekend and US S&P
futures are about flat as a result (Eurozone stocks are off ~40-50bp and Asia ended mixed).
Eco data was solid out of Germany and Taiwan but none of those numbers are altering the
domestic narrative (the China Dec FX reserve figures were about inline). On the political
front GOP support for the “repeal-without-replace” ACA strategy appears to be waning
(which is likely neutral for the S&P although could be an indirect positive to the extent it
preserves political capital for Trump to expend elsewhere such as on tax reform).

• Calendar – the focus for Mon 1/9 will be on US consumer credit for Nov (3pmET), a few Fed
speakers (Rosengren and Lockhart), some earnings (AYI, CMC, GPN pre-open and APOL,
CUDA, and WDFC after the close), and conferences (ICR and JPM Healthcare).

• Eurozone stocks – the main Eurozone indices are off ~40-50bp. Chemicals, banks,
insurance, media, real estate, healthcare, telecoms, and energy are all lagging while autos,
basic resources, and tech are outperforming.

• FX – the DXY rebounded Fri and that strength is persisting into Mon (the DXY is up ~20bp).
The USD is up a lot vs. the GBP (the GBP is down ~100bp) following remarks from PM May
over the weekend. The CNY/CNH both saw weakness Mon following the China FX data out
over the weekend.

• Treasuries – 2yr yields are flattish while 10 and 30yr yields are down ~2 and 3bp.

• Asia – trading was relatively quiet in Asia w/Japan closed for a holiday. The other markets
were mixed: Hong Kong (Hang Seng +0.25%, HSCEI -0.09%), mainland China (SHCOMP
+0.54%, Shenzhen +0.3%, CSI 300 +0.48%), Taiwan (TAIEX -0.32%), Korea (KOSPI -0.02%),
Australia (ASX 200 +0.9%), and India (down ~10bp for the major indices). There wasn’t a lot
of major Asia-specific news other than the China Dec FX reserve figures (about inline) and
the Taiwan trade figures (which hit after the close and were solid).

• Hong Kong - Macau was the clear outperformer +2.9% while Cement -0.55% and Coal -0.4%
lagged. COLI +1.4% moved higher after its project Kai Tak No.1 (II) received ~1,500
reservations for 125 units available, 11x oversubscribed. HK property names remained well
bid despite the recent 6-7% rally on demand recovery, technical breakout and improving
funding, CKP +0.71% SHK +0.6%. Large dispersion amongst Energy names with Petrochina
making new high +2.3% while CNOOC declined 0.9%. China gas names were well bid after
media reported Air Products has placed a bid to acquire Yindge Gases, all large caps reacted
positively ENN Energy +4.15% China Res Gas +6.2% China Gas Holdings +5.26%. Macau
names put on strong performances driven by external broker comments and ahead of
positive seasonality (Chinese New Year), Sands +2.67% Wynn +3% Galaxy +4.26%. In the
financials, we saw some risk-off with all Chinese Insurers offered China Life -0.5% CPIC -
0.54%; at the same time AIA +1.23% outperformed mainly driven by its defensive feature.
Autos were very active with Geely +3.8% announcing a profit warning (more than double
the earnings in FY17) and GWM +1.24% announcing a target of 1.25m units for FY17.

• South Korea – Samsung Electronics extended its gains from last week following the Thurs
night upside earnings report (up another 2.82%) while Hynix did very well too (up 3.23%).
This was offset by weakness elsewhere – NAVER -2.5%, KEP -2.27%, POSCO -2.4%,
AMOREPACIFIC -4%, etc.

• Taiwan – the TAIEX ended down 0.32%. A lot of the large-cap tech names finished in the
red (Largan -3.26%, Hon Hai -0.36%, MediaTek -1.36%, Novatek -2.73%, etc) although there
were some pockets of green (Quanta +1.99%, Inventec +4.46%, AUO +2.39%, Foxconn
+0.71%). TSMC ended flat ahead of its earnings later this week.

#Top Headlines for Monday

• German eco numbers come in solid – Nov IP came in +2.2% Y/Y (vs. the St +1.9%), exports
+3.9% (vs. the St +0.5%), and imports +3.5% (vs. the St +1.1%). See JPMorgan takeaways:
http://bit.ly/2i7MJm7

• German politics – the SPD, Linke, and Green parties in Germany have outlined the
conditions by which they would form a coalition. The parties in aggregate have more seats
than Merkel’s coalition and thus their alignment could result in a new chancellor for the
country. However, the SPD and Linke have in the past differed materially on certain policies
(which could complicate any attempt to combine in a coalition). Reuters.
http://reut.rs/2jshXJC

• Brexit negotiations – PM May said the UK would make a definitive break w/the EU but
wants to negotiate the best possible trade deal w/the bloc – WSJ
http://on.wsj.com/2iTQOfE


• Taiwan – trade numbers for Dec come in strong (exports +14% vs. the St +10.4% and
imports +13.2% vs. the St +10%). Bloomberg.

• Trump/cabinet – Trump’s management policy in the WH will represent a sharp break from
the Obama era. According to Politico, Trump plans on giving his cabinet secretaries and top
aids sig. latitude to run their agencies. Trump also is encouraging his secretaries to “make a
splash” within the first six months of his presidency – Politico http://politi.co/2iUOOWE

• Trump/Sessions/immigration – the Washington Post discusses how the Trump team could
wind up imposing significant restrictions on the H-1B visa program. Trump and Sessions
want to materially overhaul the program and could even scrap it all together. Washington
Post http://wapo.st/2i9sCXY

• Corporate tax reform – Larry Summers criticizes the Ryan/Trump corporate tax proposal in
a Washington Post editorial; while tax reform is crucial, Summers thinks there is a better
way (Summers sees four problems w/the Ryan/Trump blueprint – it increases inequality,
harms certain American business sectors, could spark protectionist measures from other
countries, and would threaten entitlements by eroding the tax base) – Washington Post
http://wapo.st/2i5pv53

• Fiat Chrysler – the co said it would invest an extra $1B in the US, creating 2K new jobs in the
process – FT http://on.ft.com/2iSKwie (the WSJ discusses how auto makers are
increasingly in the “hot seat” as Trump pressures the industry over production plans
http://on.wsj.com/2iYRkLZ).

• Dialog Semi has pre-announced preliminary 4Q16 sales of $365m (+5.6% QoQ, -8% YoY),
broadly in line with Bloomberg consensus. The underlying cash generation was modestly
higher than our estimate. Company hasn't given any commentary on 1Q17 and FY17 –
Udeshi http://bit.ly/2iUyF3x

#Top Headlines from the Weekend

• Trump facing economic headwinds and tax doubts – Politico discusses that while US
growth remains decent, trends are quietly slowing and in contrast to Obama in ’09 Trump
today is inheriting an economy resting on relatively solid foundations and at/near fullemployment
(thus while Obama’s record benefited from easy economic comparisons,
Trump’s will suffer from the opposite set of conditions). Meanwhile, further Fed tightening
will act as a headwind while investors are growing increasingly nervous about the fallout
from the GOP tax reform proposal. Politico. http://politi.co/2j2a0aM

• Growth/inflation risks skewed to the upside – the latest JPMorgan Global Data Watch
(from Bruce Kasman) discusses how upside risks are building to the growth and inflation
forecasts. The clearest case for a positive GDP growth surprise is in the manufacturing
sector. The improvement in manufacturing aligns with better news on global consumption
and our global services activity PMI, building the case for stronger global GDP growth. A
surge in animal spirits could turn the tide in the direction of sustained stronger growth.
Upside risks to inflation complement upside growth risks. The global economy isn’t without
obstacles – we are mindful of headwinds to EM growth and remain skeptical that US fiscal
policy will turn materially stimulative. http://bit.ly/2irBCVX

• Tax reforms – the NYT looks at the House GOP corporate tax reform plan. Over time the
proposal could have virtuous effects on the US economy by encouraging more domestic
production and employment while reducing the reliance on debt. However, those benefits
would only accrue over the long-term while implementation of the GOP blueprint (which
the NYT calls the most revolutionary overhaul in the history of the corporate tax code) could
create enormous disruptions almost immediately (harming sectors particularly dependent
on imports like retail while strengthening the dollar to such an extent it impacts EMs and
others). NYT http://nyti.ms/2jhceCx

• Retailers face multibillion dollar tax hit under GOP plan – the WSJ discusses how the
border tax adjustments in the GOP plan threatens to cost the retail industry billions – WSJ
http://on.wsj.com/2iP0s3k

• Border taxes – the WSJ notes that the border tax proposal has the support of House
Republican leadership but Senators and Trump have yet to definitively weigh in on the
subject – WSJ http://on.wsj.com/2iP0s3k

• Taxes - Larry Kudlow on CNBC (Fri afternoon at ~3:40pmET) says he is ""worried"" that
markets are too upbeat around tax reform; tax reform details won't be known until the end
of this year at the earliest and Kudlow thinks there is the risk that companies defer
economic activity in anticipation of this legislation.

• Healthcare – ACA repeal at risk as four Republicans in the Senate express doubt – the
Washington Post notes that four GOP senators have expressed doubt over the ACA repeal
strategy which means the party may not have enough votes even for the reconciliation
process. Washington Post http://wapo.st/2jmX8zi (the WSJ http://on.wsj.com/2inrRIv,
The Hill http://bit.ly/2jeSdfA, and Politico http://politi.co/2jmYudr also highlight rising GOP
opposition both in the House and Senate to the ACA repeal-without-replace strategy).

• Healthcare – Republicans grapple w/ACA taxes. The GOP is trying to figure out whether to
scrap the ACA taxes during the repeal process or leave them in place. Removing the taxes
would add to the deficit and make it harder to pay for a replacement – WSJ
http://on.wsj.com/2i1B9J0

• Obama thinks ObamaCare will survive – Obama thinks his signature healthcare law will
remain intact (although it could get a new name). ""It may be called something else. And as
I said, I don't mind. If in fact the Republicans make some modifications, some of which I may
have been seeking previously, but they wouldn't cooperate because they didn't want to --
make the system work, and relabel it as Trumpcare, I'm fine with that” – ABC
http://abcn.ws/2i3b1CH

• Entitlement reform – Trump doesn’t want to “meddle” with Medicare or Social Security
according to The Hill. Reince Priebus spoke over the weekend and said Trump intends on
honoring his campaign pledge when it comes to entitlements (he won’t pursue entitlement
reform). Priebus said Trump plans to “shore up” Medicare and Social Security for future
generations by achieving 3-6% economic growth – The Hill http://bit.ly/2iRJCTr

• China Dec FX reserve data (numbers out Sat morning 1/7) – takeaways from JPMorgan’s
Grace Ng - China’s FX reserves fell by $41.1 billion in December and registered $3.01 trillion
(J.P. Morgan: 3.025 trillion; consensus: $3.01 trillion). This is the lowest level since March
2011, and compared to the peak of $3.993 trillion in June 2014. We estimate that capital
outflows in December were around $55 billion. http://bit.ly/2irrqwK

• China – the country’s Vice Finance Minister said he was confident China’s economy grew
6.7% last year. Growth expanded at a 6.7% pace in Q1-3 and Q4 is expected to have been
at or above that level – Reuters http://reut.rs/2i2v8AQ

• EU breakup risk – German Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel warned that political support for
the EU is at its lowest point ever and a break-up of the union is no longer inconceivable. ""I
once asked the chancellor, what would be more costly for Germany: for France to be
allowed to have half a percentage point more deficit, or for Marine Le Pen to become
president?” – Reuters http://reut.rs/2iRs1sP

• Russia/US – Reince Priebus said Trump accepts the findings of the US intelligence
community regarding Russia’s involvement in the US election and the President Elect may
take actions in response once he enters office – Reuters http://reut.rs/2jhEc0P

• US/NATO – the US military has vowed to conduct additional training exercises in Europe
and bolster NATO further in a bit to deter Russian aggression. ""Let me be clear: This is one
part of our efforts to deter Russian aggression, ensure the territorial integrity of our allies
and maintain a Europe that is whole, free, prosperous, and at peace” – Reuters
http://reut.rs/2iWF26E

• Fund flows – update from JPMorgan’s Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou - inflows to favor equities in
’17 - Q4 equity funds flows increased to close to $90bn worldwide on our estimates, while
bond fund flows decreased to $40bn. Extrapolating these Q4 flows into this year
mechanically implies equity fund flows of close to $400bn for 2017 and bond fund flows of
less than $200bn. http://bit.ly/2iRoVqz

• Semiconductor M&A – the White House reiterated its desire to protect American
semiconductor IP from foreign buyers amid Chinese goals of dominating the industry;
restrictions around investments by Chinese entities in the US semi industry are likely to rise–
WSJ http://on.wsj.com/2iMsxIB

• North Korea – NK on Sun said it could test an ICBM at any time and from any location.
""The ICBM will be launched anytime and anywhere determined by the supreme
headquarters of the DPRK” – Reuters http://reut.rs/2irDT3D

• North Korea – US Def. Sec threatens to shoot down NK ICBM test - Defense Secretary Ash
Carter called NK’s nuclear and missile programs a “serious threat” and threatened to shoot
down any North Korean ICBM test ""if it were coming towards our territory or the territory of
our friends and allies” – Reuters http://reut.rs/2i5zdj2

• Nigeria – the Niger Delta Avengers are preparing to resume attacks against facilities as
peace talks w/the gov’t begin to break down – Reuters http://reut.rs/2j22koL

#Macro Update
• US macro update - sentiment remains quite effusive looking out over the course of the year
although there is nervousness about a near-term digestion pullback (that could coincide
w/the inauguration on Fri 1/20). The large gap between political expectations and reality is
the single biggest cloud hanging over equities but the problem with allowing that chasm to
inform an overly negative view is: 1) growth (the nominal growth improvement predates
11/8 by several months and remains in place) and 2) timing (markets appreciate that any
Trump-linked change won’t be immediate and thus appear willing to give him the benefit of
the doubt potentially into the end of the summer).

#Calendar of events to watch for the week of Mon Jan 9
• US speakers – the week of Mon 1/9 has a big lineup of speakers w/Obama’s farewell
address on Tues 1/10, Trump’s press conf. on Wed 1/11 (11amET), and a Yellen speech
Thurs night 1/12 7pmET). Trump on Wed will be the most important assuming he holds a
true Q&A-format press conf. and fields questions from a variety of reporters (he hasn’t done
this in several months) – this would help shed light on a variety of topics including ACA
repeal/replace, deregulation, tax reform, etc. Yellen’s speech Wed night (7pmET) isn’t likely
to be a major catalyst.

• Trump catalysts for the week of 1/9 – a lot of events coming up w/a slew of confirmation
hearings and Trump’s press conf. Sessions (AG) confirmation hearing Jan 10-11, Tillerson
(State) confirmation hearing Jan 11, Pompeo (CIA) confirmation hearing Jan 11, DeVos
(Education) confirmation hearing Jan 11, Kelly (Homeland Sec) confirmation hearing Jan 11,
Chao (Transportation) confirmation hearing Jan 11, Ross (Commerce) confirmation hearing
Jan 12, Carson (HUD) confirmation hearing Jan 12, and Puzder (Labor) confirmation hearing
Jan 12. More confirmation hearings will be added to the calendar (Price at HHS and
Mnuchin at Treasury will be important). In terms of market-moving news, the ones to
watch are Tillerson, Ross, and Puzder; Carson could be interesting but only for FNMA/FMCC
(technically he will be in charge of both companies). These articles provide some more
details (Washington Post http://wapo.st/2hYBgKd and Politico http://politi.co/2ikW4rx). In
addition to all these hearings, Trump’s press conf. is scheduled for Wed 1/11 at 11amET.

• China economic numbers – Dec CPI/PPI (Tues morning 1/10), Dec imports/exports (Fri
morning 1/13), and Dec IP/retail sales/FAI and Q4 GDP (Fri morning 1/20).

• US eco data – the eco calendar is relatively sparse in the US during the week of 1/9 although
a few figures on Fri 1/13 will be in focus (Dec PPI, Dec retail sales, and Jan Michigan
Confidence).

• Bank earnings – the CQ4 bank earnings season kicks off Fri morning 1/13 (BAC, BLK, FHN,
FRC, JPM, PNC, and WFC will all post results that morning). The Q4 numbers will prob. be
somewhat of an afterthought with investors much more focused on mgmt.’s guidance
commentary (impact from higher rates, deregulation, etc.). Also, any deleterious effects of
higher rates will be watched closely too (including any softening in loan demand, esp.
mortgages, credit deterioration, etc.).

#Catalysts for 2017 – big events to watch for 2017 (preliminary list – additional events likely to be
added)

"$MU (Micron Technologies) DD (part 2, more concise); A look at the price history on Friday and this week, LPDDR5X DRAM, P/E Ratio, NAND Flash growth, and the CEO's performance.",54,r18dmo,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r18dmo/mu_micron_technologies_dd_part_2_more_concise_a/,18,2021-11-24 21:28:43,"**TL;DR and TL;DR of the TL;DR at the bottom.**

What’s up y’all. I’ve taken 90mg of Adderall, and a double strength coffee (with more on the way). Let’s get this DD started. I’m going to make this DD a little more concise and approachable than my initial deep-dive DD.

Again I would recommend Eurobeat music to help you power through this DD in the right mood:

**Will MU be running in the 90’s? Bullish or bearish; let me know your opinion/analysis in the comments.**

[Part one link](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qzkdma/mu_micron_technology_deepdive_adderallfueled_dd/)

So first, we are going to look at the past three days of trading. The stock has had solid momentum over the last 30 days, and especially the past three days. Micron shares have gained 27% this month, the last 30 days have brought the annual gain to 34%.

**Why did MU pop on Friday:**

**Micron opened at 78.93, had a high of 83.86, a low of 78.93, closed at 83.03 (7.80% change), and 47.22M volume.**

[Covered in the first DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qzkdma/mu_micron_technology_deepdive_adderallfueled_dd/) *Micron climbed a lot on Friday. This was due to an analyst at Evercore ISI adding the memory chip maker to his list of top stock picks. [He anticipates a return to earnings growth next year.](https://www.barrons.com/articles/micron-stock-price-earnings-chip-shortage-51632864045?mod=article_inline).*

(
*‘“In his note, Muse wrote that while shares of chip makers like Micron have lagged behind the PHLX Semiconductor index, or SOX, since early June, the tide may be shifting.*

*“We believe negative sentiment was due to investor concerns over the sustainability of PC, handsets, and cloud demand, which was also compounded by DRAM spot pricing that began to flatten out in May/June 2021,” Muse wrote.’*

[Useful Nasdaq article explaining Friday’s hype ""Why Is Everyone Talking About Micron Stock?”](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-is-everyone-talking-about-micron-stock)

This is also due to the Citi upgrade (see Monday section).

**Why did MU pop on Monday:**

**Micron opened at 83.66, had a high of 87.67, a low of 83.66, closed at 83.86 (1.00% change) and 34.35M volume.**

MU popped again on Monday, with shares rising as much as 5.6%. Monday’s rise was due to a variety of reasons, outlined below.

**An important thing to note is that despite the market slide on Monday, Micron generally held its own and remained green.** The rest of my calls were obliterated, meanwhile the calls I bought pre-market and 5 minutes after open remained in profit. I did not sell these on the peak, I am still holding them. 


*Evercore ISI analyst upgrade from Friday:* 
Again due to the Evercore ISI price upgrade on Friday, MU saw strong momentum on Monday.

*Citi analyst upgrade from Friday:*
*“Citi analyst Christopher Danely said the pricing correction in the DRAM market was ""drawing to a close"" as the PC and server markets stabilized and expanded. As such, he expects Micron to benefit from ""more positive catalysts"" in the coming months and maintains a ""buy"" rating with a price target of $120 -- more than 40% above its current price.”*

*CNBC article released pre-market:*
[An article was released on Monday from CNBC, 7:00AM EST.](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/22/micron-stock-has-best-day-in-18-months-traders-see-bigger-breakout.html)  This highlighted the two analyst upgrades, their targets, and the upside. Due to CNBC’s wide reach, this highlighted the stock to other investors and drove momentum. 

One bearish thing to note (not in the article), from CNBC ‘Trading Nation: “On CNBC’s ""Trading Nation,"" Michael Binger of Gradient Investments said semiconductor stocks that have gained sharply in the recent period are likely to pull back.”
However my opinion as of Wednesday is that this has happened to much of the semi-sector Monday/Tuesday, but MU has remained largely unaffected thus far.

*Micron’s LPDDR5X DRAM is going to be used in the MediaTek Dimensity 9000:*

**This is important news, I’m going to cover this later in my DD.** This was also announced pre-market. 
*[“Micron Technology, Inc. (MU) revealed that its low-power double data rate 5X (LPDDR5X) DRAM for MediaTek Inc.’s new Dimensity 9000 5G flagship chipset for smartphones has been validated.](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/micron-lpddr5x-dram-to-feature-in-mediatek-dimensity-9000)*
 
*”Built on its 1α (1-alpha) node, the new chipset will help smartphones unlock applications powered by artificial intelligence and 5G innovation. Micron claims LPDDR5X to be the fastest and most advanced mobile memory available. It says that it has shipped the first batch of samples.”*
 
*“Meanwhile, Micron disclosed that it was joining hands with leading smartphone manufacturers and chipset vendors to enable ecosystem innovation with LPDDR5X.*
[*Micron outperformed the general market on Monday*](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/micron-technology-inc-stock-rises-monday-outperforms-market-01637619013)

[*Nasdaq recommended Micron as one of top 4 stock trades for Monday*](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/4-top-stock-trades-for-monday%3A-lcid-hood-mu-fl-2021-11-19)

[**Furthermore MU was the 3nd (2nd according to other scrapers) most discussed stock on Wallstreetbets Monday**](https://www.benzinga.com/trading-ideas/long-ideas/21/11/24215526/gamestop-top-discussed-stock-on-wallstreetbets-heading-into-new-week-micron-tesla-and-th)

**Why did MU pop again on Tuesday:**

**Micron opened at 85.04, had a high of 87.71, a low of 84.33, closed at 85.41 (1.85% change), and had a volume of 31.64M**

Micron again showed strong performance yesterday. Again, much of the semi sector was sliding/underperforming, yet Micron remained strong. 

The primary reason for this was that [Mizuho](https://www.mizuhogroup.com/) upgraded Micron back to a buy (one month after it was downgraded). 

[Link to Marketwatch article](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/micron-upgraded-back-to-a-buy-at-mizuho-just-one-month-after-it-was-downgraded-11637672539?mod=mw_latestnews)

Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh again became bullish on Micron. He upgraded it to buy, after downgrading it to neutral on October 20th. He changed his price target to $95 from $75.

*“When Rakesh downgraded Micron last month, he cited expectations of a soft demand outlook for the first half of 2022 for PCs and notebooks, server and handset markets.*

*“However, our recent checks indicate the ‘ACTUAL’ demand is improving across all three markets,” Rakesh wrote in a research note, with first-quarter PC/NB builds “only” flat to down 5% from the previous quarter, compared with expectations of a 10% to 15% decline and handsets flat versus expectations of down 10%. He also believes server demand could improve.”*


[From Barrons:](https://www.barrons.com/articles/micron-mu-western-digital-wdc-stocks-analyst-buy-51637675537)
“New data indicated actual demand was improving across PCs, servers and handsets that “could support an improved pricing,” prompting [Rakesh to raise the stock to Buy](https://www.barrons.com/articles/micron-mu-western-digital-wdc-stocks-analyst-buy-51637675537) and boost his price targets. The new target for Micron is $95, up from $75”

*“Rakesh estimates that first-quarter PC and netbook builds will only decrease between 0% and 5% quarter over quarter, up from previous estimates that they would fall between 10% and 15%. PC demand alone could be up as much as 5% year over year, a shift Rakesh said was surprising given Wall Street consensus that demand would be down between 2% and 3%.”*

*”Requests for memory chips in China also could improve compared to previous estimates, as well as orders from server hosts like Amazon ( AMZN ) and Google (GOOGL). An additional boost could come from upcoming investments in the metaverse and virtual reality.”*

*”Micron may be a new darling among analysts. Last week, Evercore ISI analyst C.J. Muse added Micron to his list of top stock picks, anticipating a return to earnings growth next year.”*

[**Micron was once again one of the top discussed stocks on Wallstreetbets on Tuesday, being in the fourth position.**](https://www.benzinga.com/trading-ideas/long-ideas/21/11/24243247/gamestop-remains-top-wallstreetbets-interest-zoom-video-micron-technology-and-these-are-)

**Wednesday outlook:**

MU is currently declining pre-market. Opening at 85.59, with a high (so far) of $86, and a (current) low of 84.62, where it is at right now as I write this segment (13:22PM GMT/08:22 EST/07:23 CST). There is no negative news, so I expect this is due to the current slide of the semi-segment and general market slightly affecting MU (whereas the past two days it has almost-always remained green despite the current market). However it is only down 0.90%, we will see what happens at open. I will update this segment then. I will also include any news that comes out today.

Update: MU is still remaining strong. As of 10:25AM EST, it has so far peaked at 86.72, after opening at 84.65, the current low being 84.65 also. Volume so far is 6.81(M). Current price (10:27AM EST) is 86.15 representing a  0.85% change. 

*Wednesdays news/articles:*
12:36AM EST: [“Micron Rallies Against The Grain” (Investing.com)](https://www.investing.com/analysis/micron-rallies-against-the-grain-200609364)

Approx 8:40AM EST [:”Micron Technology Stock Is at the Middle of an Upswing, Not the End”](https://investorplace.com/2021/11/mu-stock-is-at-the-middle-of-an-upswing-not-the-end/)

An analysis of the MediaTek Dimensity 9000 news [(Micron LPDDR5X DRAM to Feature in MediaTek Dimensity 9000)](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/micron-lpddr5x-dram-to-feature-in-mediatek-dimensity-9000):

“[Micron is the first semiconductor company to sample and validate this fastest, most advanced mobile memory](https://www.mediatek.com/blog/mediatek-and-micron-validate-lpddr5x-for-dimensity-9000) in the industry and has shipped the first batch of samples of LPDDR5X built on its [first-to-market 1α (1-alpha) node.](https://investors.micron.com/news-releases/news-release-details/micron-delivers-industrys-first-1a-dram-technology)”

*‘“This 1α node achievement confirms Micron’s excellence in DRAM and is a direct result of Micron’s relentless commitment to cutting-edge design and technology,” said Scott DeBoer, executive vice president of technology and products at Micron. “With a 40% improvement in memory density over our previous 1z DRAM node, this advancement will create a solid foundation for future product and memory innovation.”’*

*‘“Our new 1α DRAM technology will enable the industry’s lowest-power mobile DRAM as well as bring the benefits of our DRAM portfolio to data center, client, consumer, industrial and automotive customers,” said Sumit Sadana, executive vice president and chief business officer at Micron. “With our industry leadership in both DRAM and NAND technology, Micron is in an excellent position to leverage the growth in memory and storage, which are expected to be the fastest growing segments in the semiconductor industry over the next decade.”’*

It is noteworthy that Samsung was the first to announce LPDDR5X DRAM, however Micron was the first to validate it’s LDPDDR5X module DRAM in partnership with MediaTek. **Micron has already shipped the first batch of this DRAM module.**  This is not surprising as Micron has been making GDDR5X and GDDR6X VRAM for Nvidia GPU’s for many years. 

Micron has also revealed that samples of this new memory module for smartphones supports data rates of up to 8.533 Gbps, making it 30% faster than LPDDR5 modules (it is worth noting these are the highest achievable figures for the standard, and not real world figures). 

**How is LPDDR5X RAM on the MediaTek Dimensity 9000 better than LPDDR5?**

[Relevant chart of the Micron LPDDR5X used by MediaTek](https://imgur.com/yKsnPyo)

This RAM is the newest standard in RAM technology for mobile devices. It aims to improve the data transfer on RAM chips used in mobile devices such as the DImensity 9000 (or other counterparts such as Samsung Exynos and Qualcomm Snapdragon). It is claimed that these Micron DRAM modules (produced with 1-alpha technology) consume the lowest power among mobile DRAMs.

[**When sampled**](https://www.digitaltrends.com/features/lpddr5x-ram-vs-lpddr5-dram-dimensity-9000/) Micron’s LPDDR5X solution achieved data transfer speeds of up to 7500Mbps, however this is behind the transfer rates supported by the new standard (8533Mbps). As Micron emphasized on the 8533 figure, my personal prediction is that it will soon bring out products achieving higher transfer speeds (or that it is maybe saving them for other manufacturers than MediaTek). LPDDR5 (highest rate) achieves 6400Mbps. 

*“Based on these results, MediaTek concluded that LPDDR5X modules lead to 17% faster transfer speeds and 15% lower latency compared to the previous generation.”*

*“MediaTek remarked the new RAM technology will allow increasingly higher levels of data processing, which are needed for the complex and heterogeneous processing units that are built into modern-day chipsets. These higher processing capabilities will be vital for the high-data requirements of the 5G era.”*

**The difference between Micron’s and Samsung’s LPDDR5X solutions can only be compared once the Snapdragon 888 benchmarks are released, or newer chips featuring the most recent RAM technology.**

*Availability of Micron’s new DRAM:*
*“Micron’s Taiwan fabs have begun volume production of 1α node DRAM, starting with DDR4 memory for compute customers and Crucial consumer PC DRAM products. Micron has also begun sampling LPDDR4 to mobile customers for qualification. The company will introduce additional new products based on this technology throughout calendar 2021.”*

**P/E Ratio:**

MU’s current P/E ratio (as of Wednesday 24th November pre-market) is 16.3x. The median P/E ratio for the US is 18x. I’m sourcing from the below linked article for this section. 

*[“Recent times have been advantageous for Micron Technology](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/a-piece-of-the-puzzle-missing-from-micron-technology-inc.s-nasdaq%3Amu-27-share-price-climb) as its earnings have been rising faster than most other companies. It might be that many expect the strong earnings performance to wane, which has kept the P/E from rising.”*

*“Micron Technology's P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's only expected to deliver moderate growth, and importantly, perform in line with the market.”*

Last year delivered a 117% gain to the company’s bottom line. The EPS has fallen 57% in total from three years ago. Therefore the recent earnings growth may have been undesirable for the company.

*“Turning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 35% per annum as estimated by the analysts watching the company. That's shaping up to be materially higher than the 11% each year growth forecast for the broader market.”*

Micron’s P/E is now in line with other companies. You can use P/E to gauge current investor sentiment and future expectations. It’s superior earnings outlook is not contributing to P/E as much as expected. When strong earnings outlook is seen with faster-than-market growth, potential risks are what may be placing pressure on the P/E ratio. 

The risk of price drop looks to be subdued, but investors likely thing future earnings could see some volatility. 

**NAND Flash revenue growth for Q3 2021:**

[Recent relevant article released today, I will be sourcing from this for this section.](https://evertiq.com/design/51010)

Hyperscaler and enterprise clients are continuing procurement in line with Q2, this is in order to deploy products based on new processor platforms. 

Major smartphone brands are expected to expand their procurement activities during Q3, as they are preparing to release new flagship models. 

*“As such, clients in both server and smartphone industries made significant contributions to the revenue growth of the NAND Flash industry for 3Q21.”* 

However, suppliers note that orders from PC OEM’s are showing signs of decline. 

“‘On the whole, the industry’s quarterly total NAND Flash bit shipment increased by nearly 11% QoQ for 3Q21, and the overall NAND Flash ASP rose by nearly 4% QoQ for the same quarter. Thanks to rising prices and expanding shipments, the quarterly total NAND Flash revenue increased by 15% QoQ to a new record high of USD 18.8 billion in 3Q21.”*

*“Demand from the data center segment remained strong, and clients continued to adopt Micron’s 176L products. However, Micron’s shipment share in the smartphone market lagged behind that of other NAND Flash suppliers. Furthermore, its PC OEM clients were starting to be affected by the uneven supply of semiconductor chips. In light of these factors, Micron’s NAND Flash bit shipment increased by a modest 4% QoQ. On the other hand, the NAND Flash market remained in a severe shortage in 3Q21, thereby driving up Micron’s ASP by about 5% QoQ. Hence, Micron’s NAND Flash revenue for 3Q21 reached USD 1.97 billion, an 8.8% QoQ increase.”*

[*Sales ranking of Branded NAND Flash makers, Q3 2021 (in million USD)*](https://imgur.com/sbJyTmY)

**NAND Flash revenue growth for Q4 2021:**

The impact of the component supply shortage has increased across numerous segments of the NAND flash market, as the capacity issues in the foundry market remains unresolved. 
Currently, NAND Flash components are in higher available supply compared to other kinds of key components. 

*“For OEMs and ODMs, the differences between the NAND Flash inventory level and the inventory levels of other components have been growing over the past several months. Therefore, they have to scale back orders and reduce stock for NAND Flash. As inventory adjustments are happening, NAND Flash contract prices will start to drop and thus bring about an end to the several quarters of strong revenue growth enjoyed by suppliers.”*

I would note that this is actually possibly negative news for MU, but will only affect Q4 and perhaps after that. NAND is only a segment of Micron’s business though. 

**Micron’s CEO, an analysis of his performance**

[“Memory chip demand has been exploding since Sanjay Mehrotra was recruited as Micron CEO in 2017.”](https://investorplace.com/2021/11/mu-stock-is-at-the-middle-of-an-upswing-not-the-end/)

Mehrotra previously founded SanDisk. He became available after Western Digital acquired SanDisk in 2016.

[After Mehrotra joined Micron as CEO, strong performance was seen in 2017 and 2018.](https://investorplace.com/2018/05/micron-technology-inc-booming-despite-low-stock-price/). Micron’s sales rose from $12 billion in 2016 to $20 billion in 2017 (fueled by data centres and smartphones). In 2017/2018, Mehrota astutely aimed production at solid state drives and graphics. One reason for this was to target the cloud boom, and their upgrade cycle to meet demands for AI applications (making memory important, and thereby putting Micron in a good position). He also aimed to balance between supply and demand that year, rather than the bear market that was indicated by current stock price. In 2017/2018, while expanding investment, Micron built up a cash reserve. It has $8 billion in cash (as of May 2018), and short term investments as of the most recent quarter at that time. Long term debt fell to $7.8 billion nd could be paid out of cash on hand. It’s price to earnings ratio was 10 (as of May 2018), which would mean a 25% bump in stock price. 

*In March 2020* [Micron surprised ‘analysts by earning $405 million, 36 cents per share, on revenue of $4.8 billion for the quarter ending in February.’](https://investorplace.com/2020/03/micron-mu-stock-offers-hope-in-turbulent-market/) Certainly strong performance despite being at the start of the pandemic.

*”The results sent MU stock up over 5% on March 26, although shares are down over 3% in mid-morning trading March 27.”*

“Shares rose sharply thanks to a [conservative outlook from CEO Sanjay Mehrotra](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/micron-earnings-conservative-outlook-seen-as-prudent-but-rest-of-year-remains-a-big-question-2020-03-23), who has seen many booms and busts in his 30 years as a memory company executive.”

*“Last week, Micron Chief Executive Sanjay Mehrotra said in a letter that the company took early precautions in January to limit the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus in its facilities in China and the rest of Asia and expanded those protections as the virus spread world-wide.”*

*“We have also carefully managed raw materials and our supply chain to maintain our manufacturing capabilities and production,” Mehrotra said. “Our global team has shown tremendous strength and solidarity, operating with excellence despite lockdowns and quarantines that challenged staffing, shipments and work schedules.”*

Because memory chips are commodity products, MU stock is prone to sharp rises and falls. Until recently (as of March 2020) it was said to be riding a “supercycle,” with chip-based memory replacing spinning disks in devices, PCs and the cloud.’

*Analysis as of today 24th of November 2021:*
Memory has been going through a ‘super-cycle’ for years now, this is due to SSD’s/flash memory replacing standard HDD’s in consumer devices and more recently in data centres. SSD’s/flash memory are faster and more reliable. As the price has been coming down for SSD’s/flash memory, the switch to these has accelerated. 

Analysts may warn that this ‘super-cycle’ is peaking, however it is just [cooling down](https://www.kedglobal.com/newsView/ked202107140009). And as outlined in my previous DD, in 2023, 2024 and the future. We can actually expect memory demand to exponentially increase. 

[Chart showing price projections of various DRAM product categories for Q3](https://imgur.com/bPkMum5)

The current supercycle is expected to run [until 2023 (“The super cycle in global memory chips, where price strengthening is coupled with demand overwhelming supply, is expected to last until 2023”)](https://m.pulsenews.co.kr/view.php?year=2021&no=489942), and could go well beyond that with new demand from [the Machine Internet](https://cplaneai.com/the-machine-internet-age/). As well as cloud-computing. 

Mehrotra sees it continuing. As outlined in my previous DD, he has set a capital budget of [$150 billion for the next decade.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/micron-plans-over-150-billion-in-capital-r-d-spending-in-decade-ahead-11634724001).

[**My opinions on MU options are in the previous DD**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qzkdma/mu_micron_technology_deepdive_adderallfueled_dd/)

**TL;DR:**

* Fridays performance was strong due to Evercore ISI Analyst upgrades, as well as a Citi upgrade.

* Mondays performance was due to the Evercore ISI and Citi analyst upgrades, as well as other factors including; CNBC article, LPDDR5X DRAM announcement, and other articles released/general hype. It was one of the top discussed stocks on WSB.

* Tuesdays performance was due to Mizuho analyst upgrade. It was also one of the top discussed stocks on WSB.

* Micron’s LPDDR5X solution achieved data transfer speeds of up to 7500Mbps, however this is behind the transfer rates supported by the new standard (8533Mbps). As Micron emphasized on the 8533 figure, my personal prediction is that it will soon bring out products achieving higher transfer speed.


* *“Micron’s Taiwan fabs have begun volume production of 1α node DRAM, starting with DDR4 memory for compute customers and Crucial consumer PC DRAM products. Micron has also begun sampling LPDDR4 to mobile customers for qualification. The company will introduce additional new products based on this technology throughout calendar 2021.”*

* “‘On the whole, the industry’s quarterly total NAND Flash bit shipment increased by nearly 11% QoQ for 3Q21, and the overall NAND Flash ASP rose by nearly 4% QoQ for the same quarter. Thanks to rising prices and expanding shipments, the quarterly total NAND Flash revenue increased by 15% QoQ to a new record high of USD 18.8 billion in 3Q21.”*

* Q4: The impact of the component supply shortage has increased across numerous segments of the NAND flash market, as the capacity issues in the foundry market remains unresolved. Currently, NAND Flash components are in higher available supply compared to other kinds of key components. 

* The current supercycle is expected to run [until 2023 (“The super cycle in global memory chips, where price strengthening is coupled with demand overwhelming supply, is expected to last until 2023”)](https://m.pulsenews.co.kr/view.php?year=2021&no=489942), and could go well beyond that with new demand from [the Machine Internet](https://cplaneai.com/the-machine-internet-age/). As well as cloud-computing. 

* Mehrotra sees it continuing. As outlined in my previous DD, he has set a capital budget of [$150 billion for the next decade.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/micron-plans-over-150-billion-in-capital-r-d-spending-in-decade-ahead-11634724001). Please see my last DD or the link for more info on this budget. 

**TL;DR of the TL;DR:**
Analyst upgrades, hype and new RAM technology have contributed to the price rise this week. NAND flash shipments are rising Q3. There is a supply shortage across the market. The memory supercycle is expected to continue until 2023 and perhaps beyond. The CEO of Micron is delivering high performance, expects this to continue and has set a capital budget of $150 billion for the next decade.",0.3,2021-11-24,0

# **What could be ‘shocker’ economic reports may test stocks in week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/27/what-could-be-shocker-economic-reports-may-test-stocks-in-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> Everything from auto sales to manufacturing surveys and employment data in the coming week will likely paint a bleak picture of how much the first weeks of the coronavirus shutdown have already hit the economy.
*****
> Market turbulence is expected to remain high, though volatile moves in the past week were largely to the upside. The S&P 500, by Thursday, had soared 20% intraday off its Monday low, before giving up some gains Friday. For the week, the S&P 500 was up 10.3% at 2,541.
*****
> The market’s rip higher ignited a debate about whether stocks have now bottomed, and that discussion will carry on into the week ahead. Some major investors like billionaire investor Leon Cooperman and BlackRock’s Rick Rieder believe stocks may have hit their lows. Other strategists say the market needs to see a retest before a bottom can be called.
*****
> “It’s amazing to me that people are so bullish when virus cases are accelerating and economic growth is deteriorating,” said Richard Bernstein, CEO Richard Bernstein Advisors. “I could see it if cases peaked out, and the economy is troughing.”
*****
> # It’s the economy
> In the coming week, the big number to watch could again be Thursday’s weekly jobless claims, up a record 3.2 million for the week ended March 21, as the shutdown of stores, restaurants, and other businesses across the country resulted in immediate layoffs. 
*****
> Economists expect several million more claims to be filed for the past week, and they are looking at that new claims report as potentially more important than Friday’s March employment report. The survey week for the March jobs report was ahead of some of the major shutdowns by the states most impacted by the virus. Economists expect nonfarm payrolls to drop by 56,000 in March, according to Dow Jones.
*****
> Other data could show some of the early signs of an economy brought to a standstill. There are auto sales and ISM manufacturing releases on Wednesday, both March reports. Service sector data will be released Friday.
*****
> Market focus will be more intensely focused on the economic data, shifting from the $2 trillion aid bill, signed by President Donald Trump on Friday. Economists expect the economy already may be in a slowdown and that it should trough with a double-digit decline in the nation’s gross domestic product in the second quarter.
*****
> Vehicle sales will be reported Wednesday, and sales are expected to have come to a near standstill even though shuttered dealerships continue trying to deliver autos to buyers.
*****
> For “car sales, I would think the drop would be more precipitous,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton. “They shut down in every major market. Even though they’re offering deliveries and all that stuff, it’s going to be a shocker ... large double digit decline.”
*****
> Auto sales were at an annualized pace of 16.8 million in February, and some economists say the number in March could be closer to 12 million.
*****
> Congress passed a $2 trillion aid package to help put cash in the hands of workers and companies, so they can weather the effects of a shutdown.
*****
> Separately, the Fed has delivered a massive amount of monetary stimulus that has helped ease up some of the problems in illiquid credit and even the Treasury market.  It has been buying Treasury and mortgage-backed securities at a record pace of $70 billion a day, and markets are focused on when the Fed will alter the size of its purchases, which are open-ended.
*****
> “This week, plus last week was more than $600 billion. It’s monumental.” said Michael Schumacher, director, rates at Wells Fargo. The Fed said it was reducing the purchases to $60 billion a day, which is the amount it had been buying in a one-month period.
*****
> # Stimulus one-two punch
> The double-barreled boost to markets from the Fed’s policy and the prospect of the fiscal spending package helped fire up the mid-week rally in stocks. 
*****
> “Even though the market, from the intraday low on March 23 through the intraday high on March 26, soared more than 20%, which to many is the definition of a new bull market, this low must be sustained before a new bull market can be crowned,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. “We’ve got to maintain this recent low, in my opinion, for another six months before we can call this another bull market.”
*****
> Stovall said the S&P 500 is often higher in April, though this year it may not be. The S&P is down about 14% for the month of March so far. Since World War II,  April has been the second best month for the S&P, which has been up an average 1.5% and higher 71% of the time.
*****
> The big rally in stocks this week is not an unusual occurrence in a bear market, Stovall said. “There have been multiple times in history - 1973/1974, 2001/2002, and combined with 2008, 2009, that we saw 20 plus percent rallies before ultimately setting an even lower low.”
*****
> Stovall said it’s likely there will be a lower low. “The only think that causes me to say we may not retest the bottom is everybody is saying we need to retest the bottom,” he said. The S&P hit a low of 2,191 before bouncing higher.
*****
> # Credit un-crunching
> In addition to its Treasury and mortgage purchases, the Fed has cut rates to zero, added liquidity in the repo market and committed to creating vehicles to help corporate paper, municipal bonds and corporate debt.
*****
> “Stress levels in financial markets have receded in a meaningful way this week, thanks in no small part to the Fed’s aggressive moves.  Leveraged loans rebounded somewhat in price yesterday, and the MBS market is seeing broadening improvement (though it is far from normal),” noted Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont.
*****
> Stanley said the Fed may not need to buy corporate bonds for now, based on new issuance activity in that market this week.

# Will the Fed’s Bold Moves Keep Yields from Rising?

> With the major stock market indexes all entering a bear market this month, it’s no surprise that stocks have stolen most of the spotlight. However, actions taken by the Federal Reserve (Fed) to support what may be considered the safest part of the bond market, US Treasuries, may actually have more lasting implications for investors’ portfolios.

> From February 19 through midday March 9, the yield on the 10-year Treasury fell an incredible 125 basis points (1.25%), briefly reaching an all-time low of just 0.31%. In fact, the 14-day relative strength index RSI on the 10-year yield, a technical measure of momentum, was more oversold than at any point since 1971. Since then yields came roaring back, trading as high as 1.27%, before fading back to near 0.8% currently.

> It is logical to think that the incredibly bold moves from the Fed, including unlimited Treasuries purchases, will help keep yields down. But could yields actually rise from here after the Fed writes the bond market a blank check? History says yes, which seems counter-intuitive. For investors, it’s important to keep in mind that the combination of low starting yields and rising interest rates may lead to meager future fixed income returns.

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, following prior announcements of quantitative easing (Fed securities purchases), yields have actually risen. Part of that story is the market pricing in higher inflation expectations as a result of the “money printing.” Another piece is the market becoming more confident in economic recovery. “The massive injection of liquidity into the bond market by the Federal Reserve—in concert with fiscal stimulus—surely helps shore up the economy and credit marekts for an eventual recovery,” noted LPL Financial Sr. Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

> LPL Research forecasts the 10-year Treasury yield will end 2020 in the range of 1.25-1.75%. Outcomes outside of that range are certainly possible depending on how long it takes to get the pandemic under control.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Yields-after-QE.png?ssl=1))**

> If the roughly $2 trillion in fiscal stimulus is added to the Fed’s securities purchases, and additional lending capacity that the Fed’s new programs create, the economy will get a $5-6 trillion jolt in the next several months to help us get through this crisis to the other side. In a $22 trillion US economy, that is significant and far exceeds the stimulus that dug the economy out of a ditch after the 2008-2009 financial crisis. This human crisis is not over unfortunately, but the bold moves from policymakers should help lessen the blow. The size of hit became evident in Thursday’s massive spike in jobless claims. The economic data will get worse before it gets better, but visibility into the peak of this crisis is starting to come into view and markets—both stocks and bonds—may be beginning to sniff that out.

*****

# Making Sense of Skyrocketing Jobless Claims

> Weekly new jobless claims were reported this morning, and to no one’s surprise they rose to levels thought unimaginable just a few weeks ago. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, 3.3 million people filed new claims for unemployment benefits in the week ending March 21, almost 5 times the previous high of 695,000 set in 1982.

> “The personal and economic disruptions represented by the latest new claims number are staggering,” said LPL Chief Investment Officer Burt White. “This is a genuine human crisis, and a robust response from the Federal Reserve and Congress seems appropriate. Unfortunately, we do expect more numbers like this in the coming months. At the same time, markets are forward looking and will be more focused on how quickly we might be able to get to the other side.” Per LPL’s Chart of the Day:

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Blog-Chart-20-03-26-New-Claims.png?ssl=1))**

> While the number of new claims is extraordinary, it’s not entirely unexpected. The United States and countries across the globe have shut down entire segments of their economies in an effort to delay or disrupt the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of the jobs most impacted by social-distancing measures, such as cashiers, restaurant workers, and hotel staff, are in the services sector, which now makes up about 80% of the jobs in the United States.

> There is no silver lining in a number like this, but there is reason for hope. The US economy was not in a recession prior to the global spread of COVID-19. Workers are not being let go because of some structural fault in the economy or a financial crisis. As a result, when the slowdown ends, we may not see the extended hiring delay that has typically followed recessions. In fact, a surge in demand may require extra hiring, although it may not take place until people are fully confident that social distancing is no longer necessary.

> Markets may not be responding to the dramatic numbers seen this morning, but they have been absorbing the rapidly changing economic expectations it represents over the last few weeks. We’ll see a lot of this over the next couple of months: historic numbers with markets seemingly unmoved. But it’s not because they’re indifferent. Economic data is slow moving and backward looking, while our economic reality has been changing at an unprecedented pace. Even new unemployment claims, which are released weekly, seem somewhat stale. Markets will still be reacting to shifting expectations of the depth and duration of the slowdown, as well as the effectiveness of policies to help businesses and workers get to the other side.

*****

# Market Volatility Stresses Liquidity

> The COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented volatility in recent weeks that has investors and traders scrambling to assess the economic and market impact of the aggressive containment measures.

> This past week the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), which measures the implied 30-day volatility of the S&P 500 Index based on options contracts, measured its highest reading since its inception at over 82—besting the prior high set during the financial crisis in 2008-2009, shown in the chart below. That is saying something.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Blog-volatility.png?ssl=1))**

> As market participants have sought shelter from the storm in traditional safe havens such as US Treasuries, gold, or cash, we have seen signs that liquidity has dried up. All that means is buyers have become more tentative, demanding lower prices to get trades done due to the historic volatility and heightened uncertainty. That in turn can lead to wider bid-ask spreads for market participants—both retail investors and institutions—and we sometimes see a dollar of value selling for 95 cents, if not less.

> We have seen some of this in the corporate bond markets in recent days. Even short-maturity, high-quality investment grade corporate bond strategies have seen market prices disconnect with their fair value, as measured by net asset value (NAV). That metric essentially adds up the value of individual bonds in a portfolio such as an exchange-traded fund, which should in theory match the market price of the security that we all see on our screens.

> “In volatile markets, quality items go on sale to clear the racks because there aren’t a lot of shoppers walking through the malls,” noted Ryan Detrick, LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist. “Improving liquidity in all markets can help restore investor confidence after being shaken the past few weeks.”

> At their worst, these conditions can translate into serious dislocations, such as those experienced during the financial crisis when banks didn’t trust each other enough to make overnight loans and credit froze up. Short-term lending is a necessary lubricant for economic activity.

> Investors can get hurt selling into these dislocated markets. This is where the Federal Reserve (Fed) comes in. The programs the Fed launched on Monday, March 23—including buying large amounts of corporate bonds—are aimed at restoring health to credit markets. The central bank’s aggressive bond purchases (as much as needed) should help restore orderly trading in corporate bonds and narrow spreads, a measure of risk, which have widened significantly in recent weeks. As shown in the chart below, spreads are still well short of 2008-2009 highs.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Credit-spreads-blog-chart-for-3-24-20.png?ssl=1))**

> There is some other good news here. These dislocations can present opportunities for buyers to get discounts they may not otherwise see in normally functioning market environments. We aren’t suggesting running out and buying securities trading at the biggest discounts to their intrinsic value. Instead, we are highlighting that attractive opportunities are emerging in the corporate bond market, particularly in strategies focused on strong companies that may emerge on the other side of this crisis as leaders of the economic rebound.

*****

# Time In The Market Versus Timing The Market

> The incredible volatility continues, with the S&P 500 Index now in one of its worst bear markets ever, along the way making the quickest move from an all-time high to down 30% at only 22 days. What is a long-term investor to do?

> “Although market timing is very alluring to investors, especially after the past few weeks, the reality is timing things incorrectly can set you back significantly,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “In fact, if you started in 1990 and missed the best day of the year each year for the S&P 500, your annual return was nearly cut in half.”

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the annualized return for the S&P 500 from 1990 to 2019 was 7.7%. Yet, if all you missed was the best day of the year, that return dropped to only 3.9%. Miss the best two days of each year, and you were up less than 1% a year. Taking it to the extreme, if you missed the best 20 days of each year, you’d be down 27% per year.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/chart-3.24.png?ssl=1))**

> No one can consistently pick the best or worst days of the year, so this is why it can be so dangerous for investors to miss time in the market by trying to time the market. If you miss one or two big days, compounded over time, this can greatly impact your portfolio.

*****

# Boeing (BA) Sends the Dow Flying

> Turnaround Tuesday has carried into hump day with the Dow up well over 5% again today as of this writing. As we mentioned in an earlier post, that means the Dow is on track for its first back-to-back up days for the first time since early February. Remarkably, even with only two consecutive up days, the index is closing in on exiting a bear market. For that to happen, the Dow would need to close above the 22,310.32 level which is 20% off of the bear market closing low (Monday's close at 18,591.93). At today's high, the Dow was less than 300 points or 1.32% from that level.

> As for the individual stocks contributing to the rally, Boeing (BA) deserves a lot of thanks. The stock has been hit very hard during the sell-off. Whereas the stock has traded in the mid-$300 for much of the past two years and up to mid-February, as of late last week BA had fallen below $100. That massive drop in price means that day to day movements in the stock would have a lesser impact on the level of the price-weighted Dow. In spite of this, BA has contributed over 400 points to the Dow's rally in the past two days alone! That is much more than any other stock in the index with the next biggest contributor being UnitedHealth (UNH) who's 335.44 point contribution comes as its share price is currently around $100 more than BA. BA's contribution is also almost 200 points more than those of McDonald's (MCD), Visa (V), and Apple (AAPL). Of all 30 Dow stocks, there is only one that is down over the past couple of days, subtracting from the index's rally: Walmart (WMT). Given WMT has held up fairly well recently, its performance is yet another example of investors' focus on the more beaten down names that we have noted earlier today and in last night's Closer.

"Rite Aid ( RAD $RAD ): Spear Point Capital Management and Its Data Valuation / Monetization Partner Silverback to Provide Details on Non-Binding Offer to Acquire Rite Aid in the First Data-Backed Leveraged Buyout During Webinar Scheduled for Thursday, April 28, 2022",3,u8vjiv,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/u8vjiv/rite_aid_rad_rad_spear_point_capital_management/,14,2022-04-22 01:01:23,"&#x200B;

MIAMI, April 21, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Spear Point Capital Management, LLC (""Spear Point"") and Silverback United, Inc. (still trading under ML Capital Group, Inc. \[OTC:MLCG\] pending FINRA approval of name and ticker symbol change) announced they will host a webinar to explain the terms of Spear Point's recent proposal to acquire Rite Aid Corporation in a take-private transaction valued at approximately $3.6 billion, including long-term debt, not including operating leases.

Fundamental to that proposal, Spear Point noted that its data valuation and monetization partner, Silverback, has made a preliminary determination that Rite Aid's data may have significant value that could exceed the equity value of the company. In its Term Sheet, Spear Point offered to enlist Silverback's services to value Rite Aid's data as part of its due diligence process. Furthermore, Spear Point offered to share that valuation with the board of Rite Aid and allow the company to seek a higher value after the data valuation had been presented. Rite Aid refused that offer.

Therefore, on April 28, 2022, Spear Point and Silverback will host a joint webinar in which the Spear Point team will walk webinar participants through its Term Sheet, and give insights into its strategic vision for Rite Aid. Silverback will present its data valuation methodology and monetization strategy that underpins the transaction's value proposition. Interested parties can register for the ""Twitter Spaces"" webinar at: [https://silverbackinc.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=yifnRJwx3w0zW7q22dyOJK5s0iDN4X8V6uK3TdSD0ekTQ4iTFmI6rHZAmhfF_rbg4sb45kRI-EGqqJOzcwR9KnQG7LSqrwSNjVgY3ZkP7G1KqgpWZ4t2dYKnGdyazLCXLieLVOKRijgMweekI1clRPE-MdqVoYoTg6qaSPEff7mL0QPQn022BamtJWKogQ1IYlqesF3IqCtYo4VLnsPQitHSx_lwD0VBXd_98Nn6agE=) or [https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1YqGopapwzjJv](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=yifnRJwx3w0zW7q22dyOJD1Qt6lPS39hlFH27bjgzKFbHg5QWz4izIL79mrquUq3r-ldnNSZaRJCjZOovc62R_gVqdorCyOIpRNC7aQg-pqNX-tH-esBCVeYhVXaHaGf8hw6rWPIoWwoR7LLBjE38mzePU05IRNjgUpt-Ite9jK_E0gxJsyppLUudd4UL82bd4dtc318Yqt2WZsCrbsUmiBQbcsttjKf7IshEUVrpG5mzr1bdaVJo6hymMG5-UcheT3zMUpa0uZDk5s_FLozzF0DmFbmvrkQyszK8dDLjEM=)

""We would like to invite Rite Aid's shareholders, stakeholders, and management to join us in a discussion about why we think Rite Aid is significantly undervalued and explore management's inability to unlock that value. We would also welcome Rite Aid CEO Heyward Donigan or any other member of the company's senior management to join us to explain the company's position on the proposed offer and how they expect to create significant shareholder value in the coming years. Because, obviously, the only logical reason to not even explore our proposal would be that they have a superior plan to create even greater shareholder value. I would love to hear it, as I suspect shareholders would. The shareholders deserve more and we have a plan to give them that.""

Looks pretty bearish\*\* to me. 20k, almost 1/10th of the workforce, is striking due to ATT 'negotiating in bad faith' with the workers. I have multiple friends sitting on their ass today. If we get some good network failures, it could get suddenly ugly in the media.

Following the US’ attack on several top Iranian officials in Iraq, energy prices have spiked higher, supporting **energy stocks (CVX, XOM, SLB, XOP, XLE)** and defence stocks such as **Lockheed Martin (LMT)** whilst weighing on **airlines (LUV, DAL, AAL)** in addition to dampening appetite for risk in general, **banks (XLF, BKX, JPM, WFC, C, BAC)** particularly will face pressure from the Treasury curve’s bull flattening. With Iran vowing a swift response, participants are cautious of further geopolitical escalation which could see these asset price movements continue, although desks are also cognizant of previous flares of conflict which have proved short-lived in regard to market reactions, such as the swift reversal of oil prices following the attacks of Saudi’s Abqaiq oil facility in September 2019.

**Apple Inc. (AAPL)** has had its PT raised to USD 330 both at BofA (prev. USD 290) and RBC (prev. USD 295). BofA analyst Wamsi Mohan cites third-party data as indicating strong double-digit YY growth in App Store revenue, in addition to other positive revenue trends. RBC analyst Robert Muller sees an improved near-term outlook and expectations of a multi-year upgrade cycle to accommodate incoming 5G.

#NASDAQ 100

**Illumina Inc (ILMN)** has mutually agreed with **Pacific Biosciences of California Inc (PACB)** to terminate their merger agreement from 2018, where Illumina was to acquire the latter for USD 1.2bln in cash. UBS analyst Dan Brennan says the announcement is unsurprising following UK and US regulators blocked the deal and the announcement doesn’t change his Buy thesis on Illumina.

**Incyte (INCY)** Phase 3 GRAVITAS-301 study of graft-versus-host disease treatment, itacitinib in combination with corticosteroids, did not meet its primary and secondary endpoints; a slew of research analysts have cut their PTs on the stock as of such, including a downgrade at Mizuho.

**Tesla Inc (TSLA)** has cut its prices for its China-made Model 3s by 16% to USD 42,919, ahead of their delivery, after receiving Chinese subsidies. Elsewhere, Q4 2019 vehicle production achieved record rate of almost 105k, delivering a record 112k (exp. 104k); in 2019 as a whole, TSLA delivered 367.5k units. Model 3 deliveries came in at 92,550 units in Q4 (exp. 86,280); produced 86,958 units of Model 3 in Q4.

#S&P 500

**Humana Inc. (HUM)** has been upgraded to ‘Conviction Buy’ from ‘Buy’ at Goldman Sachs with a PT of USD 425, where analyst Stephen Tanel expects significant upward earnings revisions from 2021 and beyond after the recent repeal of the health insurer industry fee.

**Lamb Weston Holdings Inc (LW)** Q2 20 (USD): Adj. EPS 0.80 (exp. 0.84), Revenue 1.02bln (exp. 0.96bln). Raises FY adj. EBITDA view to 965mln-985mln (prev. 950mln-970mln); FY Revenue view in high end of mid-single digit range.

**Newmont Goldcorp (NEM)** following the completion of the divestiture of its 50% stake in Kalgoorlie Consolidated Gold Mines to Northern Star Resources Limited, has lowered its FY20 gold production view to 6.4mln ounces from 6.7mln ounces.

**Mattel Inc (MAT)** is to reduce the number of products it sells by 30%, WSJ reports, where it will axe items mainly from the 45% of its offerings that attribute to only 6% of its revenue.

**Sony Corporation (SNE)** has made efforts to penetrate the autonomous vehicle tech market, where it is reportedly working on a silicon-based vision sensor.

**Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM)** could see revenue growth of at least 15% in 2020 driven by strong 7nm chip sales. industry sources also report that TSMC has received orders from **Intel (INTC)** for automotive AI chips, which are expected to attribute to revenue in H2 2020.

**Wesco International Inc (WCC)** has raised its acquisition offer for **Anixter International Inc (AXE)** to USD 97 per share in a cash and stock deal, following private equity firm Clayton Dubilier & Rice offering USD 93.50 per share on Thursday.",-0.1875,2020-01-03,1

Good afternoon and happy Saturday to all of you on this subreddit. I hope everyone made out pretty nicely in the market last week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead! :)

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 1st, 2019.

# **Key data could end or defend recession fears as stocks notch best quarter in a decade  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/29/data-could-end-or-defend-recession-fears-as-stocks-notch-best-quarter.html)**
*****
> Stocks head into the second quarter propelled by the best quarter in nearly a decade as the long tepid IPO market starts to simmer again.
*****
> But the markets also face a reality check in the week ahead with some key data that could help clarify whether the economy is losing steam or just stumbling through a soft patch. The key release is Friday's March jobs report, with economists expecting 170,000 new nonfarm payrolls, after February's deeply disappointing 20,000 jobs, according to Refinitiv. There is also important manufacturing data from China over the weekend and the U.S. on Monday.
*****
> Lyft Inc's big IPO Friday on the back of Levi Strauss the week earlier has boosted some optimism for a year of new offerings that some analysts say could rival or surpass the more than $100 billion record of new issues in the year 2000, if conditions remain good.
*****
> ""The Levi Strauss IPO and the success it had last week encouraged many of these companies to accelerate their timing,"" said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Advisors. ""IPO issuance has been modest relative to history for the last couple of years, so the fact we're finally seeing some companies come to market may signal some kind of optimism or confidence, but it's far from the type of thing we've seen historically in terms of the euphoria surrounding it.""
*****
> Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Alliance said with $700 million in potential offerings in the wings, this year could surpass the all-time record reached in 2000, when the new issue market was viewed as overheated and many companies without earnings or prospects made it into the public arena during the tech bubble.
*****
> ""In general, big IPOs tend to drive general enthusiasm for the overall market until they don't do well,"" said Hogan, noting the follow through trading in Lyft, the biggest IPO since Alibaba went public in 2014. Lyft, priced at $72, surged about 20 percent on the opening but closed up just about 8.7 percent at $78.29.
*****
> Stocks were higher in the past week, and the S&P 500 turned in its best first quarter performance since 1998. The 12.9 percent gain was also the best quarterly performance since the third quarter of 2009, just as the now 10-year-old bull market took off. The S&P is now less than 4 percent from its record high.
*****
> Earnings season kicks off in the next several weeks, and between now and then there could be some high profile warnings on the first quarter, expected to be the first quarter with negative earnings growth in three years.
*****
> Arone said while earnings are expected to be weaker, revenues are expected to grow by nearly 5 percent, a positive sign.
*****
> ""That needs to be reconciled form my perspective. It wouldn't shock me if companies doe better than expected, and end up with positive year-over-year comparisons,"" said Arone.
*****
> Trade talks with China remain the overriding issue for markets. Chinese Vice Premier Lui He comes to Washington to meet with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who traveled to Beijing this past week.
*****
> Analysts expect a deal in the coming months. ""We're likely to get some type of negotiated deal that both sides can claim victory on, where China will buy more U.S. goods, where there is some progress on U.S. intellectual property and technology transfers...But I don't see a deal that's going to be a game changer...a big move in one direction. I think the market has accepted that reality,"" said Arone.
*****
> In the past week, stocks were higher but so were bonds, to the point where the 10-year yield reached a low of 2.34 percent before returning to the 2.40 percent level. Yields move opposite price.
*****
> The week earlier, the 10-year yield dipped beneath the yield on the 3-month bill, meaning the yield curve was inverted. When that happens and long-term rates are lower than short-term rates, it is viewed as a recession warning. Practically it would mean lenders, who borrow on a short term basis, would be lending at the lower longer term rates.
*****
> The bond market also moved to price in a Fed interest rate cut this year, after pricing in a hike just several months ago. That was in response to the Fed's forecast for no more rate cuts this year, released after its March meeting. It had been forecasting two interest rate hikes previously. The fed funds futures now is priced for a quarter point of easing this year and another next year.
*****
> Markets calmed down as the week came to a close, but every piece of data has become more important. On a positive note, weekly jobless claims data, the most current look at the labor market, showed a downtick and the four week average is now 217,000, the lowest since January.
*****
> The economy's growth definitely slowed down in the first quarter and growth was tracking at about 1.5 percent, after the 2.2 percent gain in the fourth quarter. Economists have expected the weakness in the first quarter, both due to the government shutdown and bad winter weather, to be temporary but the question is whether growth can get a jump start in the second quarter.
*****
> ""The jobs number is key here,"" said Wilmington Trust chief economist Luke Tilley. The February report showed just a tenth of the job creation many economists had expected. ""Our best thinking it it's statistical volatility, and it's not a real indication of what's going on in the labor market, and it will bounce back. That's the most important thing that's coming out next week....We think about 200,000 jobs were added. I think there's some upside risks to that.""
*****
> Tilley said manufacturing data in the week ahead will be important, as it could show whether the sector remained sluggish at the end of the first quarter. March ISM manufacturing and PMI data will be released Monday, and durable goods, which includes business spending data, is important when it is released on Tuesday. Monthly vehicle sales are also released Tuesday.
*****
> Economists expect ISM manufacturing at 54.2, unchanged from the month earlier. China was also to release manufacturing PMI data over the weekend.
*****
> February's delayed U.S. retail sales report is also expected on Monday. Retail sales are expected to have gained 0.3 percent in the month, up from 0.2 percent in January and December's shocking decline.
*****
> Steve Massocca, managing director at Wedbush Securities, said he's watching for any sign of inflation in wages when the jobs report is released Friday. The Fed's preferred PCE inflation index showed sluggish inflation growth, up just 0.1 percent in February.
*****
> ""I don't think [the data] is as big an issue as it was when the Fed was actively talking about raising rates,"" said Massocca. 
""They said publicly they're not going to raise rates for the rest fo the year.""
*****
> There are just a few Fed speakers, who will be of interest because of the change in market expectations for Fed interest rate policy. Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester speaks Thursday, and Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic speaks both Wednesday and Friday.

# What Does A Big First Quarter Mean?

> With a day to go, this is one of the best first quarters for the S&P 500 Index ever. Of course, it comes on the heels of the worst fourth quarter since the financial crisis and the worst December since the Great Depression. Still, you have to be impressed with the overall bounce back after the big drop late last year.

> “A big start to the year historically has suggested the bulls could remain in charge the rest of the year,” explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “In fact, 9 of the past 10 times the S&P 500 was up at least 10% during the first quarter, the rest of the year was also in the green.”

> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, continued gains the final three quarters of the year were quite normal after a big first quarter. It is worth noting, however, that extreme gains might not be in the cards, as the average return for the final three quarters of the year is 5.8%, which is actually lower than the average year’s final three quarters of 6.3%.

# April Almanac: DJIA’s Best Month

> April marks the end of our “Best Six Months” for DJIA and the S&P 500. On April 1st, we will begin looking for our seasonal MACD sell signal and corresponding early signs of seasonal weakness. Even in historically strong pre-election years the “Worst Six Months” have been lackluster on average. 

> April 1999 was the first month to gain 1000 DJIA points. However, from 2000 to 2005, “Tax” month was hit, declining in four of six years. Since 2006, April has been up thirteen years in a row with an average gain of 2.3% to reclaim its position as the best DJIA month since 1950. April is third best for S&P and fourth best for NASDAQ (since 1971).

> The first half of April used to outperform the second half, but since 1994 that has no longer been the case. The effect of April 15 Tax Deadline appears to be diminished with numerous bullish days present on either side of the day. Traders and investors are clearly focused on first quarter earnings and guidance during April. Exceptional Q1 earnings and positive surprises tend to be anticipated with stocks and the market moving up in advance of the announcements and consolidating or correcting afterwards.

> Typical pre-election year strength does bolster April’s performance since 1950. April is DJIA’s best month in pre-election years (+4.0%), second best for S&P 500 (+3.5%) and third best for NASDAQ (+3.5%). Small caps measured by the Russell 2000 also perform well with gains (+2.8%) in seven of ten pre-election year April’s since 1979.

# First Trading Day of Q2: DJIA and S&P 500 Higher 75% of the Time

> According to the Stock Trader’s Almanac 2019, the first trading day of April is DJIA’s fifth best first trading day of all months based upon total points gained. Looking back at the last 25 years, in the tables below, we can see DJIA and S&P 500 have both advanced 75.0% of the time (up 18 of last 24) with average gains right around 0.4%. NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have slightly weaker track records but are both still up more frequently then down. Last year, April’s first trading day was dealt a blow with losses exceeding 2% by S&P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000.

# Good News Indicators

> The Conference Board’s Leading Economic Index (LEI) is one of our favorite economic indicators. It is designed to predict future movements in the economy based on a composite of 10 economic indicators (like manufacturers’ new orders, stock prices, and weekly unemployment claims) whose changes tend to precede shifts in the overall economy. Last week, the LEI expanded for the first time in five months, along the way tying the all-time high set September 2018. Additionally, it is up 3% year over year (YoY).

> The combination of continued weak economic data around the globe and various parts of the yield curve inverting are leading many to surmise that a recession is likely imminent. The good news is that the LEI has not turned negative on a YoY basis, which it has done prior to every recession since the 1970s. And even when it has turned negative, it was another eight months on average before a recession officially occurred (with a median of six months lag time). For this reason, and because of its solid track record of predicting recessions, the LEI is a component of LPL Research’s Five Forecasters.

> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the LEI remains well above the 0% YoY threshold, which would be a definite negative—on multiple levels.

# 11 Things You Need To Know About The Yield Curve

> Well, it finally happened—the yield curve inverted. Now note that it was the shorter end of the curve that inverted, as the 3-month Treasury bill (and 1-year T-bill) now yields more than the 10-year Treasury for the first time since 2007. This matters because an inverted yield curve is the bond market’s way of saying there is a potential recession on the horizon. “The yield curve inversion is something that nearly everyone is talking about, given its perfect track record at predicting recessions,” explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “At the same time, however, we simply aren’t seeing other areas of the economy that would confirm a recession just yet, so there is more to this story.”

> Please note that there is no one true “yield curve,” as the yield curve simply looks at the yields of a shorter-dated fixed income instrument and compares it to a longer-dated one. In fact, the more commonly discussed 2-year/10-year yield curve spread hasn’t inverted, and it is actually above the early December 2018 lows.

> Here are 11 things worth considering regarding the yield curve.

> * Each of the past 9 recessions back to the 1950s saw the 1-year/10-year yield curve spread invert approximately 14 months on average before a recession.
> * Although a yield curve inversion preceded all 9 previous recessions, not all inversions led to a recession. For instance, the 3-month/10-year yield curve inverted in 1966 and 1998, with neither leading to an immediate recession.
> * The shorter end of the yield curve has inverted, but the longer end is actually steepening. For instance, the 10-year/30-year yield curve has steepened most of this year. In past recessions, all parts of the curve inverted before a recession took place.
> * Financial conditions aren’t tight, as tight conditions coupled with the yield curve inverting, historically has led to a recession. Investment-grade corporate and high yield spreads remain calm, however, suggesting that not all parts of the bond market are worried about an impending recession.
> * Market participants have fully priced in a Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cut within the next year, potentially further flattening the curve. Should the economy gain steam during the second half of this year (which we think is possible) it will likely avoid a Fed rate cut, which should lead to a steeper yield curve.
> * We have found that a spread between the 3-month/10-year yield curve has become much more predictive of a recession at -50 basis points (-0.50%). So this still is a clear concern, but a marginal inversion may not be so worrisome.
> * Yield curves aren’t always perfect: Japan has had long stretches of inverted curves that didn’t lead to recessions. Additionally, both the United Kingdom and Germany have had inversions without recessions.
> * The fed funds rate has been significantly higher during previous inversions. In fact, the fed funds rate has averaged more than 6% when the 1-year/10-year yield curve has inverted. It is only 2.4% currently.
> * The previous 5 recessions began an average of 21 months after the 2-year/10-year yield curve inverted. Stocks actually did quite well initially after inversions as well, with the S&P 500 Index not peaking until over a year after the inversions and gaining nearly 22% on average at the peak.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/7-16-18_Blog_table1_0319.png?ssl=1))**

> * Various yields around the globe continue to sink, with nearly $10 trillion in global debt now yielding less than 0%. The German 10-year Bund, for instance, is beneath 0% for the first time since 2016. We think this is due more to a concern over the European slowdown, which has forced many to look to the United States as a safe haven for sovereign debt, thus pushing our yields much lower along the way. This concept is discussed in more depth in our latest episode of the LPL Market Signals podcast.
> * As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the S&P 500 has actually outperformed the average year the previous three times the 2-year/10-year yield curve inverted. To reiterate though, the 2/10 spread hasn’t inverted yet.

# The Bespoke Report — Good, Bad, Or Ugly?

> Stocks have basically held the line this week despite huge moves in interest rates and an ongoing rough run for global economic data. Curve inversion has many forecasting a recession, and we’ve seen a number of recent data releases that make us much more nervous about that outcome than we have been in almost a decade. On the other hand, the pivot to dovishness from global central banks, the relatively modest size and scale of yield curve inversion, some nascent signs of bottoming in global growth, and the nature of the plunge in interest rates are all reasons to not panic. Besides, despite all of the negativity US stocks have held up admirably well, and markets that trend higher on bad news are generally regarded as strong, rather than weak. In short, the outlook could be Good, Bad, or Ugly…depending how you read the tea leaves!

# A Strange Trip With Some Strange Leaders

> With sentiment where it was at the end of last year following the Q4 rout in equities, it’s safe to say that not a lot of investors were expecting double-digit gains in the first quarter. That’s exactly what we have seen in US equities, though, as the major averages are all up over 10% YTD heading into the final hours of the quarter. While the Dow has lagged many of its peer indices this year, it too is still on pace to finish Q1 with a gain of just over 10%.

> In the table below, we show how each of the 30 components in the DJIA have performed on a YTD basis as well as how much they have contributed to the index’s total gains. Remember, the DJIA is a price-weighted index, so the sole determinant of a stock’s weight in the index is its price. Looking at the table, you’re likely not the only one doing a double-take at the two stocks that top the list of best performers in the index so far this year. That’s right, Cisco (CSCO) and IBM have been the index’s two top performers in 2019 with gains of nearly 24%. Behind these two stocks, United Technologies (UTX) and Apple (AAPL) are the only two other stocks that are up 20% or more. To the downside, just five stocks in the DJIA are in the red on a YTD basis. Leading the way lower, Walgreens Boots (WBA), the newest stock in the index, has declined over 7%, but none of the four other stocks are down more than 3%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/032919-DJIA-Performance-1.png))**

> Because the DJIA is price-weighted, the best-performing stocks in the index haven’t been the biggest contributors to the YTD gains. The chart below shows how many points each stock in the index has contributed to the YTD gains. Looking at things this way, you may be surprised to see that Boeing (BA) still tops the list. With its 17% YTD gain and very high share price, BA has contributed 374 points to the DJIA’s upside this year, beating out the next closest component (AAPL) by 160 points! All else being equal, BA could fall another 23 points (6.0%) and it would still be the largest contributor to the DJIA’s YTD gains.

#[Today's Top Headlines for Thursday, April 2nd, 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/02/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-april-2-2020.html)

*****

> * U.S. stock futures were pointing to an over 300-point rebound for the Dow Jones Industrial Average at Thursday’s open ahead of what’s expected to be another unprecedented number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits. The Dow closed nearly 4.5% lower on the first day of the second quarter after logging the worst first-quarter ever. The 10-year Treasury yield dropped to under 0.6% early Thursday as global coronavirus cases approach 1 million. Oil futures bounced about 10% from highly depressed levels after President Donald Trump said he expected Saudi Arabia and Russia to reach a deal soon to end their price war.

*****

> * Economists expect that 4 million to 5 million, or even more, workers filed for jobless claims last week. The Labor Department releases its weekly tally at 8:30 a.m. ET. The consensus forecast is for 3.1 million first-time claims after the previous week’s record high of nearly 3.3. million. On Friday, the government issues its monthly report on job creation. However, the March numbers are expected to show little impact from the outbreak because the survey period went only to about the middle of the month — before the effects of the stay-at-home orders were felt.

*****

> * The president is set to meet with the leaders of at least seven major energy companies on Friday as U.S. producers struggle to break even after crude prices recently hit 18-year lows and turned in the worst quarter ever. Trump, at Wednesday evening’s outbreak briefing, said the administration is considering halting some domestic flights and rail lines between cities hard hit by the virus. Also Wednesday, White House health advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said the first human trial testing a potential vaccine to prevent COVID-19 is “on track” with public distribution still projected in 12 to 18 months. He called it the “ultimate game changer” in the fight to control the pandemic.

*****

> * With coronavirus testing becoming more widespread, U.S. confirmed cases surged to more than 216,700, according to Johns Hopkins University data. American fatalities rose to 5,137. The White House, predicting a “very, very painful two weeks,” estimates a death toll of 100,000 to 240,000. Globally, known cases reached about 942,000 — nearing 1 million since the outbreak started in China in December. There have been 47,521 worldwide deaths and about 186,000 recoveries. Italy has the second most cases globally at more than 110,500, nearly half the U.S. total. But it has the most deaths, 13,155.

*****

> * Boeing — whose stock has been slammed by the coronavirus economic halt and last year’s grounding of its 737 Max fleet — is reportedly set to start offering early retirement and buyout packages to workers. Several media outlets, including The Wall Street Journal, said that an internal announcement is expected as soon as Thursday. Last week, Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun said it will take “a few years” for the company to get its balance sheet back in shape, but he balked at the idea of the government taking an equity stake in the company in exchange for aid.

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Tuesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/23/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-feb-23-2021.html)

*****

> # 1. Nasdaq set to sink again as Big Tech slide continues

> * U.S. stock futures were mostly lower Tuesday, pointing to a 1.4% decline in the Nasdaq, one day after the index sank nearly 2.5% in its worst single-day drop in almost a month. Tech stocks continued to slide in Tuesday’s premarket, with Apple down another 2% after closing lower by nearly 3% Monday.

> * Dow stock Home Depot dropped 2% in premarket trading on worries that Covid pandemic sales gains won’t last. A stock drop of that magnitude would put a major dent in modest year-to-date gains.

> * The S&P 500 on Monday fell almost 0.8%, in a fifth straight decline, its worst losing streak in nearly a year. The Dow Jones Industrial Averaged bucked Monday’s downdraft, closing slightly higher. It’s doing so again Tuesday morning. All three stock benchmarks remained stronger for the month.

*****

> # 2. Bond yields have been rising ahead of Powell’s testimony this week

> * As part of mandated semiannual economic testimony, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell goes to Capitol Hill twice this week, appearing Tuesday before the Senate Finance Committee and Wednesday before the House Financial Services Committee. Rising bond yields and accompanying inflation fears are adding a higher level of interest around Powell’s remarks. The 10-year Treasury yield, which moves inversely to price, was slightly lower Tuesday morning,. But it’s been rising lately and trading around 1.36%. It was as high as 1.39% on Monday, the highest level in about a year.

*****

> # 3. B/itcoin sinks below $50,000; Tesla shares drop again

> * B/itcoin plunged 12% Tuesday morning, sinking below $50,000. The world’s largest digital currency, still up 60% this year, hit an all-time high over $58,000 on Sunday. Price swings of more than 10% are not a rarity in c/rypto markets. B/itcoin once climbed to almost $20,000 in 2017 before shedding 80% the following year. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Monday warned about those wild swings.

> * Shares of Tesla, which earlier this month revealed an investment in b/itcoin, fell another 6% in Tuesday’s premarket. The stock sank more than 8.5% on Monday, in its biggest drop since late September 2020. To be sure, other tech stocks also suffered heavy losses Monday. Ahead of trading Tuesday, shares of Elon Musk’s electric auto maker was up just 1.25% this year. However, over the past 12 months, Tesla was up nearly 300%.

*****

> # 4. Home Depot, Macy’s report better than expected quarterly results

> * Home Depot’s fourth-quarter earnings and revenue surged past expectations Tuesday, as consumers continued to invest in their homes due to the pandemic and strength of the real estate market. However, shares dropped on comments from Home Depot’s CFO, questioning how long the pandemic would last and how that may influence consumer spending.

> * Shares of Macy’s rose more than 3.5% in the premarket after the retailer Tuesday morning reported its first quarterly profit in a year. Revenue in the fourth quarter also beat estimates as the company’s efforts to cut inventories during the holiday quarter and rely less on deep discounting paid off. Ahead of Tuesday’s trading, Macy’s shares were up 35% this year, though they struggled over the past 12 months.

*****

> # 5. Electric automaker led by ex-Tesla engineer to go public

> * Electric vehicle maker Lucid Motors plans to go public at an $11.75 billion combined equity valuation through a reverse merger with a blank-check company. The deal between California-based Lucid and C/hurchill C/apital Corp IV is the largest in a series of such tie-ups involving EV companies and special purpose acquisition companies, better known as S/PACs. Shares of C/CIV fell more than 30% in the premarket. But speculation about the deal pushed the S/PAC stock up 470% this year alone. Lucid is led by ex-Tesla engineering executive and automotive veteran Peter Rawlinson.

"GME: STAY CALM, HOLD STRONG AND BUY IF YOU CAN.",11,l6zf9c,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6zf9c/gme_stay_calm_hold_strong_and_buy_if_you_can/,6,2021-01-28 20:49:14,"With a lot of people looking in, looking at you SEC, Wall Street fund managers, journalists etc, figured its best to make our image look better so we can keep the best online community going.

This community of people has united left and right, smart and dumb, and made poor people rich. And there was no news about uniting people at a time of political unrest (we don’t even talk about that here) educating people, dragging people out of debt and poverty. 

WSB did Something that big business and the government can’t do. We did all of that. Where’s the thanks, huh? 

This is not a stock manipulation community, this does not support any extremes politically, this is a community of united people, and all are welcome (unless you’re a bot or 🌈🐻, and before you read into that and consider hate speech, what’s hateful about Rainbows and Bears? You think it’s hateful, that’s you thinking it’s hateful, you’re hateful.) 

We don’t discuss personal stuff, we are united in our interest in making money. That’s all rich people do, and now your pissed that poorer people want to do the same??? Shame on you. 

So in support of keeping this community going I thought what else unites people apart from buying and holding GME? Music. (See, we don’t just talk about stonks here) 

Here’s my playlist for today and for the future whilst I’m holding, buying more when I can, and supporting the brothers and sisters that are present in this community: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/676kUHNszz1AIDQkiHdbDR?si=LwAEaFLvQgCFqARGK5tspw

Holding strong on GME (🚀🚀🚀💎🙌🌕🌕🌕🚀🚀🚀🐂🐂🐂🐂) fuck all the other distractions, that’s small fish in the ocean, GME is the big fucking Moby Dick and we’ve got it on our line and we’re reeling it in and there’s nothing you can do about it. 

This is for all the times, you took our money, took our houses, took our careers, took our friends careers, manipulated our banks, politicians and families. We relied on you to do something about this when all this happened and you did nothing. So, here we are doing ourselves, getting ourselves out, paying back debt, making something of ourselves, grabbing our bootstraps whilst sitting on the short bus and now driving the bus ourselves.

And guess what, if it was the other way round and u/deepfuckingvalue was holding large shorts, and Wall Street was propping up the stock would Bloomberg, CNBC, FT, SEC even bother looking here? Absolutely not. They don’t care about little fish like you or me, they care about Whales and guess what we’ve got. One day you will be the little fish, one day you will have the whale because you (as individuals) are just like us (except some of you actually get to fuck other people’s gfs from time to time) 

Anyway, I’m working two jobs, watching the stonks and holding strong. 

see you fuckers on the moon!",0.3666666666666667,2021-01-28,0

Today’s Bullish Activity
Gapping up to all-time highs this morning is Axsome Therapeutics Inc. (AXSM + $7.68 to $47.30) after the clinical stage biopharmaceutical company said that its experimental narcolepsy drug (AXS-12) achieved the main goal of reducing cataplexy attacks in a mid-stage trial. No serious side effects were reported and the drug met its secondary goals of reducing excessive sleeping and improving brain function. Calls are outnumbering puts roughly 3:1 with the March 2020 30.00 call topping the most actives list (volume is 510).

Also gapping up this morning is Audentes Therapeutics Inc. (BOLD + $30.19 to $58.80) following news that Astellas Pharma Inc. (ALPMY $17.08) has entered into a definitive agreement to buy the gene therapy developer for roughly $3B or $60.00/share in cash. BOLD puts are outnumbering calls better than 5:1 which is primarily being driven by activity on the February 2020 40.00 put (volume is 1,549). Other gene therapy names moving higher in sympathy with Audentes include: Uniqure NV (QURE + $9.22 to $64.00), Regenxbio Inc. (RGNX + $2.62 to $43.30), Ultragenyx Pharma Inc. (RARE + $1.24 to $40.38), Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT + $2.17 to $110.96).  

Lastly, shares of Roku Inc. (ROKU + $6.20 to $142.28) are recovering from yesterday’s ~15% drop (on a Morgan Stanley downgrade) this morning after Needham raised their price target to a “Street-high” price target of $200.00 (from $150.00) and maintained their “Buy” rating. Needham analyst Laura Martin said that she believes ROKU is a “key beneficiary” of the shift towards streaming video and should be valued as an internet aggregator, similar to YouTube in the video space. Calls are outpacing puts roughly 5:2 with the December 6th 145.00 call seeing the most action from traders (volume is 5,429).

 

New 52-week highs (26 new highs today): Constellation Pharmaceuticals Inc. (CNST + $0.61 to $45.46), Galapagos NV (GLPG + $5.01 to $200.40), Lamb Weston Holdings Inc. (LW + $0.61 to $84.64), PTC Therapeutics Inc. (PTCT + $0.85 to $48.46), Sony Corp. (SNE + $0.93 to $64.21)

Notable Call Activity
Some unusual call activity (~14:1 over puts) is being seen in Comcast Corp. (CMCSA + $0.02 to $43.66) as option traders primarily target the December 20th 44.00 call. Volume on this contract is 23,879 versus open interest of 3,971, so we know that this primarily represents new positioning. The bulk of the activity on this contract consisted of various-sized blocks that were being bought for between $0.48-0.51 each, including a 7,100 block that was bought at the ask price of $0.49, which suggests bullish intent.  

Chewy Inc. (CHWY + $0.40 to $24.23): Calls are outpacing puts better than 5:1 which is mostly being driven by activity on the December 20th 24.00 call. Volume on this contract is 6,329 (vs. open interest of 3,568) which mostly consisted of a 2,500 block that was bought at the ask price of $1.50 and (a little later) a 2,500 block that was bought at the ask price of $1.60 (both suggesting bullish intent). The positioning comes ahead of the company’s Q3 earnings report which is scheduled to be released next Monday (December 9th) after the market close.

Today’s Bearish Activity 
Leading the percentage decliners list this morning is Cara Therapeutics Inc. (CARA - $7.31 to $18.57) after the drug developer reported mixed results from a mid-stage study of its treatment for pruritus (itchy skin in kidney disease patients). The treatment reduced itching along a scale known as WI-NRS by 4.4 points (vs. 3.3 in the placebo group), meeting the main goal of the study, but the difference in the proportion of patients who had a greater than 3 point reduction in itching scores was not statistically significant. Puts are outnumbering calls roughly 2:1 with the December 20th 17.50 put topping the most actives list (volume is 2,121).

Also trading to the downside is Coupa Software Inc. (COUP - $9.77 to $139.17) even though the cloud-based business spend management platform beat quarterly earnings estimates and provided better-than-expected guidance last night after the market close. For the third quarter the company reported earnings of $0.20 per share, excluding non-recurring items ($0.14 beat and above prior guidance of $0.05-0.08) on revenue that increased 50.9% year-over-year to $101.78M and guided Q4 EPS to a range of $0.03-0.06 on revenue of $101.5-102.5M (vs. the respective ($0.02) and $99.50M consensus estimates). Puts are outpacing calls nearly 2:1 with the December 20th 20.00 put topping the most actives list (volume is 7,111). 

 

New 52-week lows (75 new lows today): Alarm.com Inc. (ALRM - $0.08 to $41.89), Apache Corp. (APA - $1.09 to $18.45), Corecivic Inc. (CXW + $0.11 to $15.03), Netgear Inc. (NTGR - $0.15 to $24.29), Molson Coors Brewing Company (TAP - $0.16 to $50.51)

Notable Put Activity
Some unusual put activity (nearly 30:1 over calls) is being seen in Phillips 66 Inc. (PSX - $1.37 to $112.96) which is primarily being driven by activity on the January 10th 2020 121.00 put. Volume on this contract is 11,202 (vs. open interest of 0) which nearly entirely consisted of an 11.2K block that was bought at the ask price of $8.60. We know this block is a new position given the open interest figure and we can assume the intent is bearish in nature since the trade took place at the ask price.

SPDR Select Sector Materials ETF (XLB - $0.53 to $58.91): Puts are outpacing calls better than 6:1 which is primarily being driven by a 5K block that was sold on the January 2020 57.00 put for $0.83 when the bid/ask spread was $0.82 x $0.87 (open interest is 3,570). We know this block is a new position given the open interest figure and we can assume that the block trader believes that XLB will remain at or above the $57.00 price level or is comfortable taking a long 500K share position in this ETF at an effective purchase price of $56.17 in the even that it closes below $57.00 at expiration.

iShares IBOXX High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (HYG - $0.22 to $86.32): Puts are outpacing calls roughly 50:1 with the December 27th 85.50 put topping the most actives list. Volume is 10,000 (vs. open interest of 203) which entirely consisted of a 10K block that was bought at the ask price of $0.38 (suggesting bearish intent).

Volume Signals     
BP PLC (BP - $0.40 to $36.91): A couple of large blocks were seen simultaneously trading out on the April 2020 expiration earlier this morning:

39.00 call (open interest is 3,507): a 6,500 block was bought for $0.77 when the bid/ask spread was $0.63 x $0.78
43.00 call (open interest is 2,075): a 6,500 block was sold at the bid price of $0.13
We know these blocks are new positions based on the open interest figures and it appears that a $4.00-wide bull call spread was established for a net debit of $0.64 (x 6,500 contracts x 100 multiplier, excluding commissions) which suggests that the block trader sees BP closing above the break-even price of $39.64 at expiration.

Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB - $0.58 to $35.28): A couple of large blocks were seen simultaneously trading out on the February 2020 expiration earlier this morning:

37.50 call (open interest is 4,764): a 7,260 block was bought at the ask price of $1.27
42.50 call (open interest is 2,585): a 7,260 block was sold for $0.31
We know these blocks are new positions based on the open interest figures and it appears that a $5.00-wide bull call spread was established for a net debit of $0.96 (x 7,260 contracts x 100 multiplier, excluding commissions) which suggests that the block trader believes SLB will close above the break-even price of $38.46 at expiration.

Gauging Volatility
The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX + 1.41 to 16.33) is trading higher for the third day in a row and at a two-month high (intraday range is 14.61-17.98) as equity markets are firmly lower across the board around the mid-day mark today (DJI - 385, SPX - 31, COMPX - 107). VIX option volume has been average today at 299,922 contracts (#5 on the top 10 most actives list) and the activity has been slightly put-biased (the volume put/call ratio is currently 1.08). The most actively traded contract is the December 18th 13.00 put as volume is 45,410 versus open interest of 268,357.",0.0,2019-12-04,1

In addition to my what shows up on my personal picks from my data, I'm also closely watching FDX and STZ for this month, they just don't quite fit the criteria I set because they're very close to their ATH and I filtered companies at least a 4% deviation from their ATH.

Enjoy and have a nice weekend you degenerates.",-0.10833333333333334,2020-09-05,0

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning September 30th, 2019.

# **The third quarter was a dud for stocks, but the fourth quarter could be full of surprises  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/27/fourth-quarter-could-hold-plenty-of-surprises-for-markets.html)**
*****
> The third quarter wraps up in the week ahead with stocks just slightly higher for the period, after a summer of zigzag moves.
*****
> The market faces some of the same challenges in the final quarter of the year, including Brexit, the trade war with China, sluggishness in the global economy and the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump. By mid-quarter, the U.S. presidential election will be just a year away, and it could become a factor that could start to trigger market volatility.
*****
> Stocks were lower in the past week, with the S&P 500 down 1%, finishing at 2,961.
*****
> For the year to date, the S&P 500 is up 18.1%, but in the third quarter, so far, it added just 0.7%. The S&P started the quarter at 2,752, went as high as 3,028 before falling back. It has chopped in a range down to about 2,860, and has repeatedly struggled to get back to its high.
*****
> “We think you stay within the range — 2,820 to 3,030,” said Julian Emanuel, BTIG head equities and derivatives strategist. Emanuel’s year-end target has been 3,000.
*****
> “We see new highs, whether they happen in the fourth quarter or in 2020, as a function of geopolitical developments. From our point of view, the developments of the last several weeks, particularly [Sen. Elizabeth] Warren rising in the polls, increases in our mind the probability you get some sort of deal with China,” he said.
*****
> Analysts said there could be more volatility because of the efforts by House Democrats to impeach Trump. The investigation into the president has to do with his withholding of aid to Ukraine and whether it was tied to a request to get dirt on front running Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.
*****
> Warren, D-Mass., whose tax and other policies are viewed as unfriendly to markets, is catching up with Biden in the polls, and some strategists see her benefiting from any negative news on Hunter Biden’s dealings with a Ukraine gas company. Emanuel said if Warren continues to gain, that may encourage China to move forward with a trade deal with Trump, for fear making a deal with Warren would be more difficult.
*****
> Besides political headlines, there is some key data coming out in the week ahead, including Friday’s September employment report, and ISM and PMI manufacturing data on Tuesday. The economy is expected to have added 145,000 jobs, above the 130,000 last month, while the unemployment rate is expected to stay steady at 3.7%, according to Refinitiv.
*****
> “We expect another month of census-related hiring to push public sector payrolls higher and, as a result, we forecast only 120k increase in private sector payrolls,” notes Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Barclays. “Our forecast for private sector employment gains in September would represent some improvement relative to August, but our forecast overall remains consistent with our outlook for slower employment growth on the heels of deceleration in economic activity.”
*****
> There are also a number of Fed speakers scheduled for next week, including New York Fed President John Williams; Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester, and Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren.
*****
> Trade will remain a major topic for markets, as U.S. and Chinese negotiators get closer to Oct. 10 talks. Headlines Friday that the White House is considering blocking or limiting U.S. investments into China sent stocks lower, after optimism about the talks lifted them early in the day.
*****
> Emanuel said the fourth quarter may have a different tone from that of the third quarter, after the wild move lower in rates during August and early September. He expects bond yields have bottomed, and he favors some of the cyclical names, like financials and energy.
*****
> “The likelihood is long-term yields move higher, and you could see some form of switching out of bond exposure and into stock exposure. That type of embracing of the stock market is typical of final innings,” for markets, he said.
*****
> Strategists said the impeachment efforts against Trump may ultimately not have a negative impact on stocks. Even if he is impeached by the House, the Senate would be expected to acquit him. Analysts liken the possible reaction to be more like when President Bill Clinton was impeached and acquitted by the Senate than when President Richard Nixon was facing impeachment proceedings. Nixon resigned before he was impeached.
*****
> Stocks gained 28% in the year after impeachment efforts began against Clinton, but lost 39% in the year after they were begun against Nixon.
*****
> Emanuel said the 2020 presidential election could also come into play this quarter, and Trump may take actions to boost the economy, such as finding a solution to the trade war with China. A resolution could give a boost to stocks.
*****
> “People are very nervous and in general reasonably well-hedged because they remember the fourth quarter of last year so well, and from our point of view, we don’t necessarily see this trading range resolve itself any time soon,” said Emanuel.
*****
> Markets will also be watching the Fed’s repo operation Monday. The Fed has been conducting open market operations to assure there is enough cash in the short-term funding market, which was under stress at the start of last week. The Fed has calmed the market, but market pros are watching to see how much activity there is and whether rates rise. The final day of the month typically sees a surge in cash requirements, and on Monday, investors may require cash for the settlement of $113 billion in Treasury securities.

# October’s First Trading Day Mixed Over Last 21 years

> Based upon data in the soon to be available Stock Trader’s Almanac for 2020 on page 88, the first trading day of October is DJIA’s fourth weakest of all monthly first trading days since September 1997 based upon total DJIA points gained. June, August and September have been weaker. S&P 500 has been down 10 of the last 21 years on the first trading day of October. DJIA’s record is slightly softer with 11 declines and NASDAQ’s performance has been the worst of the group, down 12 times with an average loss of 0.36%.

# Fruitful to Sell Rosh Hashanah

> Happy Jewish New Year to you all! I took the above picture of pomegranates last year in Tel Aviv’s Carmel Market during my adventure through Israel with my family in celebration of my eldest son’s bar mitzvah.

> As the High Holidays approach you may remember the old saying on the Street, “Sell Rosh Hashanah, Buy Yom Kippur.” It gets tossed around every autumn when the “high holidays” are on the minds of traders as many of their Jewish colleagues take off to observe the Jewish New Year and Day of Atonement.

> The basis for this, “Sell Rosh Hashanah, Buy Yom Kippur,” pattern is that with many traders and investors busy with religious observance and family, positions are closed out and volume fades creating a buying vacuum. Even in the age of algorithmic, computer, and high frequency trading these seasonal patterns persist as humans still need to turn the machines on and off and feed them money or take it away – and these algorithms and trading programs are written by people so the human influence is still there.

> Holiday seasonality around official market holidays is something we pay close attention to (page 88 Stock Trader’s Almanac). Actual stats on the most observed Hebrew holidays have been compiled in the table here. We present the data back to 1971 and when the holiday falls on a weekend the prior market close is used. It’s no coincidence that Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur fall in September and/or October, two dangerous and sometimes opportune months.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/64f4f19e19c5f8d9bb768316134c46af/9ac6dde39074b5e0-62/s640x960/be7a91356b29ad1cdc61cb6e117a0a05e2127cd3.jpg))**

> Perhaps it’s Talmudic wisdom but, selling stocks before the eight-day span of the high holidays has avoided many declines, especially during uncertain times. While being long Yom Kippur to Passover has produced 59% more advances, half as many losses and average gains of 7.0%.

> This year the high holidays commence on Sunday eve, September 29, and end October 9 with Yom Kippur right in time for Octoberphobia. The current news flow already has folks selling ahead of the Jewish High Holidays, setting up the market for further declines in notoriously volatile October.

*****

# What If September Is Up?

> Well, when the worst month of the year is up, it’s not so bad. October is slightly better when September is up. But Q4 and the rest of the year are generally more positive. In the tables below September is ranked by largest gain for DJIA and S&P 500 since 1949 and NASDAQ since 1971. Q4 remains about average, but full year gains are above average. So if September can eke out a gain then watch out for Octoberphobia, but fear not the full year.

# Financials Hold on to Broad Gains in September

> In spite of the relative weakness we have seen in equities over the last week, US stocks are still poised to finish off September and the entirety of Q3 in the black. While overall breadth among industries was more positive several days ago, there are still four sectors where every industry is still in the black on a month to date basis. As shown in the graphic below, all of the industries within the Energy, Financials, Real Estate, and Utilities sectors remain in the black for the month of September. To be fair, Energy and Real Estate each only have two industries in their respective sectors, so for these two sectors, it isn't quite as impressive. Within the Financials sector, though, all five are still up on the month while all three industries in the Utilities sector are also up MTD.

> In the Energy sector, even with this month's gains of over 4%, both industries in the sector are poised to finish Q3 with a decline. Utilities have been big winners so far this quarter, but Electric Utilities have been the clear leader with an eye-popping gain of 10.2% this quarter.

# Looking for Action? S&P 1500 Most Volatile Stocks

> For traders with a short-term time horizon who are looking for big moves, we have updated our list of the S&P 1500 stocks trading above $10 that have the largest intraday high-low ranges (based on the average percent spread between the intraday high and low over the last 50 days). The stocks are grouped based on whether they have a rising or falling 50-day moving average (DMA).

> While the VIX remains relatively low, in recent months we have started to see some big moves in individual stocks and that can be seen in the fact that a number of stocks in the table below currently have average intraday ranges of more than 5%. The most volatile stock in the S&P 1500 is Lennox International (LII), which has had an average intraday high-low range of 9.5% over the last 50 trading days. Granted, it's only an $11 stock, so the 9.5% average range works out to just about a dollar per day, but it is still volatile nonetheless. Behind LII, there are another three stocks with average daily moves of over 8%, but here again, they are all relatively low priced stocks trading at less than $20 per share. The highest-priced stock on the current list is Innovative Industrial Properties (IIPR). With a share price of $91 and an average daily move of over 5%, IIPR typically sees an intraday swing of over $5. That's a trader's dream if you trade it right, but a nightmare if you get it wrong!

> In terms of sector representation on this month's list, Consumer Discretionary is the most prevalent with 17 different stocks. Behind Discretionary, the next closest sector is Energy at eleven. Finally, with regards to the breakdown between stocks with rising and falling moving averages, there are modestly more stocks with falling moving averages (29) than rising moving averages (21), suggesting some underlying weakness even with the broader S&P 500 trading not far from new highs.

# Manufacturing: Doing Okay or In Collapse? It Depends Who You Ask.

> Last night in The Closer, we discussed the huge divergence between regional Fed manufacturing activity indices and the ISM Manufacturing Index. In the chart below, we've created a proxy for the ISM Manufacturing Index by averaging sub-indices from various regional Fed manufacturing surveys. The result is generally well-correlated to ISM, but over the last few months the two have diverged wildly. While the Five Fed indices from the New York, Philadelphia, and Richmond Fed districts would indicate an ISM reading in the mid-50s, the actual readings have been deteriorating dramatically. Of course, these three Fed districts are a relatively small snapshot of the overall national economy, but collectively their sample size is similar to the ISM's. It's hard to say which is ""right"", but the huge divergence is certainly noteworthy.

I planned on putting about 70k into the market for the long haul, and was going to just go Vanguard, but have decided to semi-yolo - a dollar cost average yolo.

I placed half of them at the end of August but had to reorder as they expired. I'm thinking there's a good chance we get to SPY ~160/170, and a lot of these were made with that in mind.

Tech is way stronger than biotech, which are my two heaviest sectors, and it looks like I might have to readjust tech up and biotech down. My first buy actually hit today with 30 ILMN at $133.12.

I could have missed out on possible gains if late August was the bottom, but whatever.",0.0,2015-10-07,0
